We are requesting approval to proceed with the proposed implementation plan and allocation of resources for a Q3 launch.\n   201→\n   202→## Background\n   203→Our current customer service model relies exclusively on human agents handling inquiries through phone, email, and live chat during business hours (8am-8pm ET). Customer satisfaction surveys indicate that 62% of customers are frustrated by wait times averaging 15 minutes during peak periods, and 78% expect immediate assistance outside business hours. Additionally, our customer service costs have increased 18% year-over-year due to growing inquiry volume.\n   204→\n   205→## Problem\n   206→Customers are experiencing significant friction in getting timely support for common inquiries, leading to:\n   207→1. Decreased customer satisfaction (CSAT scores dropped from 4.2 to 3.8 in the past year)\n   208→2. Abandoned carts (28% of customers abandon purchases when they can't get immediate help)\n   209→3. Increased support costs ($3.2M annually, growing at 18% YoY)\n   210→\n   211→Data shows that 70% of customer inquiries fall into predictable categories (order status, returns, product information) that could be effectively handled through automated systems.\n   212→\n   213→## Recommendation\n   214→Implement an AI-powered customer service chatbot on our retail website that:\n   215→1. Provides 24/7 instant responses to common customer inquiries\n   216→2. Seamlessly escalates complex issues to human agents\n   217→3. Continuously improves through machine learning based on customer interactions\n   218→\n   219→Our analysis of three potential solutions (detailed in Appendix A) shows that the Amazon Lex-based solution offers the best combination of capabilities, integration with existing systems, and cost-effectiveness. Implementation costs are estimated at $450K with projected annual savings of $1.2M and a 4.5-month ROI.\n   220→\n   221→## Next Steps\n   222→1.

We are requesting approval to proceed with the proposed implementation plan and allocation of resources for a Q3 launch.\n\n## Background\nOur current customer service model relies exclusively on human agents handling inquiries through phone, email, and live chat during business hours (8am-8pm ET). Customer satisfaction surveys indicate that 62% of customers are frustrated by wait times averaging 15 minutes during peak periods, and 78% expect immediate assistance outside business hours. Additionally, our customer service costs have increased 18% year-over-year due to growing inquiry volume.\n\n## Problem\nCustomers are experiencing significant friction in getting timely support for common inquiries, leading to:\n1. Decreased customer satisfaction (CSAT scores dropped from 4.2 to 3.8 in the past year)\n2. Abandoned carts (28% of customers abandon purchases when they can't get immediate help)\n3. Increased support costs ($3.2M annually, growing at 18% YoY)\n\nData shows that 70% of customer inquiries fall into predictable categories (order status, returns, product information) that could be effectively handled through automated systems.\n\n## Recommendation\nImplement an AI-powered customer service chatbot on our retail website that:\n1. Provides 24/7 instant responses to common customer inquiries\n2. Seamlessly escalates complex issues to human agents\n3. Continuously improves through machine learning based on customer interactions\n\nOur analysis of three potential solutions (detailed in Appendix A) shows that the Amazon Lex-based solution offers the best combination of capabilities, integration with existing systems, and cost-effectiveness. Implementation costs are estimated at $450K with projected annual savings of $1.2M and a 4.5-month ROI.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Week 1-2: Finalize technical requirements and vendor selection (Owner: Jane Smith)\n2. Week 3-6: Develop and train initial chatbot model (Owner: AI Team)\n3. Week 7-8: Internal testing and refinement (Owner: QA Team)\n4. Week 9-10: Limited customer beta (Owner: Customer Experience Team)\n5. Week 11-12: Full deployment and monitoring (Owner: Operations Team)\n\nWe request leadership approval to proceed with this implementation plan and allocation of the $450K budget by June 15th to ensure Q3 launch.\n\n## FAQ\nQ: How will this affect our current customer service team?\nA: No layoffs are planned. The chatbot will handle routine inquiries, allowing our agents to focus on complex issues requiring human judgment and empathy.\n\nQ: What is the expected customer adoption rate?\nA: Based on industry benchmarks and our customer behavior analysis, we expect 65% of customers to utilize the chatbot for initial inquiries within 3 months of launch.\n\n## Appendices\nAppendix A: Solution Comparison Analysis\nAppendix B: Detailed Cost Projections and ROI Analysis\nAppendix C: Customer Survey Data\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Lack of Specific Data\nIf the user lacks specific data to support their narrative:\n- The model SHOULD suggest types of data that would strengthen their argument\n- The model SHOULD help identify potential sources for this data\n- The model SHOULD suggest framing the narrative to acknowledge data limitations while still making a compelling case\n\n### Unclear Purpose or Recommendation\nIf the user is struggling to articulate a clear purpose or recommendation:\n- The model SHOULD ask targeted questions to help clarify their thinking\n- The model SHOULD suggest potential frameworks for structuring their recommendation\n- The model SHOULD provide examples of well-framed purpose statements or recommendations\n\n### Document Length Issues\nIf the document becomes excessively long:\n- The model SHOULD suggest moving detailed information to appendices\n- The model SHOULD help identify redundant content that can be removed\n- The model SHOULD suggest ways to make language more concise\n- The model SHOULD remind the user that Amazon values brevity and directness\n\n### Balancing Multiple Stakeholder Needs\nIf the user needs to address multiple stakeholder perspectives:\n- The model SHOULD suggest organizing the recommendation to address key concerns of each stakeholder group\n- The model SHOULD help identify common ground across stakeholder groups\n- The model SHOULD suggest using the FAQ section to address stakeholder-specific concerns\n\n","numLines":270,"startLine":1,"totalLines":270}}}

This helps to keep your resources and workflow tidy. Since your BT101 application was created as a [Burner Application][10] on a burner account, the following resources will be automatically cleaned up after 7 days:\\\\n* Pipeline\\\\n* Version set and group\\\\n* Packages\\\\n* AWS account\\\\nHowever, if you wish to be frugal and clean up the resources ahead of time, then follow these steps:\\\\n1. Go to the [My Applications page][11].\\\\n2. Find your BT101 application, named `BT101_Username_` for first timers.\\\\n3. Click Start Cleanup in the right column, you will be redirected to the cleanup page.\\\\n4. Follow the onscreen instructions for cleaning up the application resources.\\\\n5. Go to [AWS Burner Accounts][12], find your BT101 account, and click the Close Account button.\\\\nNote\\\\nIf you encounter any issues, you can still access the [legacy manual instructions][13].\\\\n## Congratulations![¶][3]\\\\nYou’ve finally completed the lab and have cleaned up all your resources, congratulations!  Hopefully you had a good experience introducing yourself to some of the core development tools used at Amazon.\\\\nThere’s a lot more to learn, of course. In addition to the other topics in this section of BuilderHub, you can browse the [ASBX Tools][14] section for information and links that will help you understand and use many more of the tools that Builder Tools offers to you, a newly-minted Amazon Builder.\\\\nNote\\\\nIf you run into any trouble, there are many resources available to help you, listed on [ASBX support][15].\\\\n## Talk with your team[¶][4]\\\\nYour team may use a different toolchain than you used in BT 101—remember that this course was only meant to give you an overview of the software development lifecycle—your teammates can help you dive deeper into the tools you’ll use in your day-to-day work.\\\\n## Course completion and next steps[¶][5]\\\\n**This is the end of BT101: Building your first service**.

You will then practice a workflow you’ll likely follow regularly, i.e., making a change to your service and then beginning the process of releasing that change.\\\\n## Create a workspace[¶][2]\\\\nBrazil works within a local directory on your system called a Brazil _workspace_. The workspace contains the package(s) that you’re working on and their dependencies. If you work with only one package, it’s possible that you’ll need only a single workspace, but many developers use multiple workspaces. Your team will inform you of how their codebase is structured and help you get your dev environment configured, but for this module you’ll create a single workspace.\\\\n1. Connect to your Cloud Desktop if you are not already, all commands in this section will be run there.\\\\n2. Navigate to your [workplace][21] directory:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ncd ~/workplace\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nNote\\\\nIf this location doesn’t exist (it should be a symlink), then you probably didn’t go through [Set up your Brazil workplace][22]. Set it up now if you haven’t done so yet.\\\\n3. Within the `workplace`, create a Brazil [workspace][23] called `BT101` by using the Brazil CLI:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil workspace create --root BT101\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nThis creates, then sets up, the directory `~/workplace/BT101` to be the root of your new local workspace.\\\\nNote\\\\nIf you receive an exception error similar to: `Exceptiondetails:Permissiondenied@dir_s_mkdir-BT101(Errno::EACCES)`, see [brazil-build returns failure with error code EACCES][24] in the Brazil troubleshooting guide.\\\\n4. Go into the workspace you just created:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ncd BT101\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n5. To check out the details of your workspace, you could run `brazilworkspaceshow`, but the sub-command **workspace** can be shortened to **ws** for any commands that manipulate your workspace. Instead, just type:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil ws show\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nYou can see that the workspace was successfully created, but there is no assigned version set and there are no packages in it yet. You’ll fix that by first specifying the version set to use.\\\\n6. BuilderHub Create created a version set for us called `BT101_Username_/development`. Tell Brazil to use that versionset with your workspace:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil ws use --versionset BT101_Username_/development\\\\n```\\\\nImportant\\\\nBuilderHub Create created a version set featuring your _username_, but using an initial capital letter (for example, if my Amazon username is `frodob` the version set name above would be `BT101_Frodob_/development`).\\\\nIf you don’t specify the version set name **exactly**, the command will fail with `Couldn'tfindaversionsetnamed...`. If you see that error, then double-check the version set name you entered and make sure that it’s correct, _including capitalization_.\\\\nWhat is a version set?\\\\nA [version set][25] is a data structure that contains all of a package’s dependencies and their versions. A version set lets you precisely manage the packages your software project depends on. You can add new packages, update existing packages, and remove packages from a version set as your software’s dependencies change over time.\\\\n7. Next, you’ll add three packages to your workspace using the Brazil CLI. One package will contain your service’s code and unit tests, another will contain the CDK configuration to run your service, and the last will contain your service’s integration tests. You’ll work with the service code and unit tests in this step, and you’ll set up the integration tests later in the workshop.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil ws use --package BT101_Username_CDK\\\\nbrazil ws use --package BT101_Username_\\\\nbrazil ws use --package BT101_Username_Tests\\\\n```\\\\nWhat is a Brazil package?\\\\nA [package][26] is the smallest buildable/deployable unit. Packages are structured as code with similar functionality that should be built and deployed together, and is often a library that performs some function or an application that is actually run. External dependencies are declared in the package’s `Config` file, often called the “big C” or “capital C” config file because it is always capitalized.\\\\n8. After the package source containing your service’s code is downloaded, you’ll find it at `~/workplace/BT101/src/BT101_Username_`.\\\\nNote\\\\nThe packages that you `use` in your workspace are always located in its `src` directory. For more information about the structure of a local workspace, see [Workspace][27].\\\\n## Open your workspace in VS Code[¶][3]\\\\nNext, you’ll open your newly-created workspace in your IDE.\\\\nFor this workshop, you’ll be using VS Code as your integrated development environment (IDE). VS Code is a free, open-source code editor that offers a rich set of features such as syntax highlighting, an integrated terminal, and a vast library of extensions. It is one of the most popular IDEs in use at Amazon.\\\\nNote\\\\nTo foster a common onboarding process for all Amazonians, in this workshop you’ll use VS Code and the [Remote - SSH extension][28] to connect to your Cloud Desktop.\\\\nIn the future you may choose to use IntelliJ IDEA as your IDE, particularly if that is the standard for your team. You may also choose a different combination of local (laptop) and remote (Cloud Desktop) development, with different options for syncing files back and forth, depending on your preferences and needs for latency, computing power, etc.\\\\nNote\\\\nYou may have already installed VS Code via the `axeinitbuilder-tools` command if you are on a Mac laptop.\\\\n1. Install VS Code per the [IDE and plugin setup][29] documentation. Open the application.\\\\n2. Select Remote-SSH: Connect to Host… from the command palette, or click the SSH status button in the bottom-left corner of the IDE.\\\\n![../_images/remote-ssh-commands.png][30]![../_images/remote-status-bar.p\"},{\"url\":\"https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/learning/bt101-build-service/\",\"displayTitle\":\"BT101: Build your service\",\"domain\":\"builder_hub\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1755129600000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":5,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"Content\\\":\\\"# BT101: Build your service\\\\n# BT101: Build your service[¶][1]\\\\n* [Create a burner account][2]\\\\n* [Install the necessary tools on your Cloud Desktop and bootstrap your burner account][3]\\\\n* [Create your service with BuilderHub Create][4]\\\\n* [Post-conditions][5]\\\\n* [Learn more about packages and version sets][6]\\\\n* [Next][7]\\\\nTip\\\\nIf you get stuck and need help completing one of the Builder Tools 101 labs:\\\\n* Most errors that students encounter and report are due to **not completing the course prerequisites**. Make sure that you’ve followed [BT101: Prerequisites][8], including the important steps with regard to development permissions, filling out the “deemed export” form, and following the post-setup steps after creating your Cloud Desktop.\\\\n* Use the `@sage` command in the Amazon Q chat window for troubleshooting assistance that can analyze error messages, suggest solutions, and provide step-by-step guidance for resolving technical issues. Amazon Q Developer has access to the Amazon wiki, BuilderHub documentation, and Sage knowledge bases to provide internal Amazon guidance.\\\\n* If you’re still having issues, visit the [#sb-onboarding-help][9] Slack channel to search for a previously asked question or post your own.\\\\n**View the following video to prepare yourself for the course before starting the instructions!**\\\\n[BT 101 2022 - Video One - BT101 Intro][10]\\\\nIn this workshop, you’ll join a team responsible for building, maintaining, and supporting a web service that other Amazon teams use. To simulate your daily responsibilities, you’ll first create a service to work with, i.e., a calculator service that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\\\\nYou will use BuilderHub Create to create a service that you can then modify to practice the process followed by Amazon developers. BuilderHub Create is a service used to produce new applications by cloning fully-functional source applications using AWS resources (Lambda, S3, ECS, Fargate, etc.).\\\\nAs you go through this workshop, **read the instructions carefully**. The steps you perform today are the same steps you will be performing on a daily basis. Try to think through why you are running each command and what the command will do. If you’re ever not sure, ask the instructor or post in the [#sb-onboarding-help][9] Slack channel!\\\\nThe goal of the course is for you to understand how to produce and release code changes in a safe and scalable manner, not merely to complete the exercise. There is no prize for finishing first!\\\\nImportant\\\\n**Read this before you start**\\\\n* Before you begin these activities, make sure that you’ve followed the steps in [BT101: Prerequisites][8] first!\\\\n* Most commands you will run are case sensitive. Pay attention to the capitalization of the commands in the instructions, and match them when running the commands. The created resources will use CamelCase notation.\\\\n* Throughout this workshop, you will be asked to use your Amazon _username_ as part of a command. Replace all instances of `_username_` with your own username, following the capitalization of the text (e.g. `_username_` or `_Username_`). If your service was generated with a “V1” or similar tag at the end of your username, also add that tag when a username is required.\\\\n## Create a burner account[¶][2]\\\\nBefore you start building your service, you will need a way to log in to AWS. As a developer at Amazon, this is typically done through tools called Conduit and Isengard, but today you will be using a _burner account_—a short-lived AWS account that allows Amazon developers to experiment with AWS features; any resources created with the account are automatically cleaned up when the account is closed.\\\\n1. Go to [AWS Burner Accounts][11].\\\\n2. Create a new account by first providing an account name, which should follow the convention `_username_-bt101`. For example, _peccy-bt101_. Check the first checkbox to acknowledge that usage is not free (don’t worry, Amazon will be picking up the tab), the second checkbox to acknowledge that you will not be using the account for production purposes, and the third checkbox that you will not be using the account for personal or public facing use (you will be using the account for Amazon trainings).\\\\n![../_images/burner-create.png][12]\\\\n3. The account may take 5–15 minutes to create. Move on to the next step. You can refresh the window later to see the account ID or creation status.\\\\n## Install the necessary tools on your Cloud Desktop and bootstrap your burner account[¶][3]\\\\nRun all the commands in this section on your Cloud Desktop:\\\\n1. Make sure you’re authenticated on your Cloud Desktop by running:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nkinit && mwinit -o\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n2. Make sure you have the latest version of Builder Toolbox, which is a cross-platform tool for installing internal Amazon development tools:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ntoolbox update\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nIf you experience an error while running this, go to [Configure a Cloud Desktop][13] in the _Cloud Desktop User Guide_ and set up Builder Toolbox, which includes the Brazil CLI, BuilderHub Create, and CRUX.\\\\n3. _Verify_ that you have the necessary tools installed:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ntoolbox list --installed\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nYou should have the following tools installed:\\\\n**If you don’t**, then go back to [Set up common developer tools using AxE Initialize][14] and set them up _before proceeding_.\\\\n * `brazilcli`\\\\n * `cr`\\\\n * `create`\\\\n\\\\n4. Install AWS Developer Account (ADA):\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ntoolbox install ada\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n5. Add the `hub-create` registry to Builder Toolbox:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ntoolbox registry add s3://buildertoolbox-registry-hub-create-us-west-2/tools.json\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n6. Install `hub-create` using **toolbox**:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ntoolbox install hub-create\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n7. Next, you will need the AWS account ID from the burner account you created earlier. Switch back to the browser tab you used to create the account earlier, or navigate to [AWS Burner Accounts][11]. Copy the AWS account ID (note that the account ID is _numeric_ and differs from the _name_ of your account) from your active account, then bootstrap your account by executing:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nhub-create prepare -a _AccountID_\\\\n```\\\\nNote\\\\nIf you receive an error after executing the previous command similar to this:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nCould not fetch credentials from both Isengard, Conduit, or from environment.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nTry the following:\\\\n 1. Ensure you’re authenticated:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nkinit && mwinit -o\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n 2. Run the following command:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nada credentials update \\\\\\\\\\\\n --account=_AccountID_ \\\\\\\\\\\\n --provider=conduit \\\\\\\\\\\\n --role=IibsAdminAccess-DO-NOT-DELETE \\\\\\\\\\\\n --once\\\\n```\\\\n 3. Try to rerun:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nhub-create prepare -a _AccountID_\\\\n```\\\\n![../_images/burner-account-id.png][15]\\\\n8. Exit your SSH session, and then reconnect to reload the shell configuration.\\\\n## Create your service with BuilderHub Create[¶][4]\\\\nYou will be using BuilderHub Create to create a sample service running on AWS Lambda. BuilderHub Create enables you to quickly create a complete service using AWS technologies and Builder Tools recommended best practices. To create your service:\\\\n1. Go to [BuilderHub Create][16].\\\\n2. Click Create Application.\\\\n3. From the listed source applications, select BT101, then click Next (if you don’t see BT101 in the list of choices, start typing “bt101” in the search bar above the list, until the BT101 source application appears):\\\\n![../_images/bt101-srcapp-search.png][17]\\\\n4. In BT101 Configuration, provide your AWS account ID from the burner account you created earlier under Burner Account ID.\\\\n![../_images/fill-burner-account.png][18]\\\\n5. (Optional) You can click Verify by the AWS account ID field to confirm your Account is bootstrapped properly.\\\\n6. Your personal software bindle is auto-chosen for you. You don’t need to make any change on the Bindle form, but need to grant some permissions in your personal bindle by clicking Grant permissions to Create, then confirming the action on Grant New Permissions page .\\\\n![../_images/grand-bindle-permission.png][19]![../_images/bindle-permission-confirm.png][20]\\\\n7. Click Next to enter the review page, where you can review the BT101 resources (like packages, version set and pipeline) that BuilderHub Create is going to create for you. The BT101 application is created as a [Burner Application][21] with a 7-day lifetime which cannot be extended. After 7 days, all resources will be automatically \"},{\"url\":\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Millowm/Templates/Ramp-Training-Schedule/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Ramp-Training-Schedule\",\"domain\":\"wiki\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1702326240000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":6,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"error\\\",\\\"error\\\":\\\"Too many redirects\\\"}\"},{\"url\":\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/RTDS/WWTD/WWSI/CDO/prerequisites/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Prerequisites\",\"domain\":\"wiki\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1754051706000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":7,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"error\\\",\\\"error\\\":\\\"Too many redirects\\\"}\"},{\"url\":\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Acheron-ADC/Services/EC2/KDS/\",\"displayTitle\":\"KDS Overview\",\"domain\":\"wiki\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1701965812000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":8,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"error\\\",\\\"error\\\":\\\"Too many redirects\\\"}\"},{\"url\":\"https://sage.amazon.dev/posts/1686105\",\"displayTitle\":\"BT101 enable integration test erro\",\"domain\":\"sage_horde\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1746462288000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":9,\"categoryList\":[\"sage$BT101\"],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\",\\\"content\\\":{\\\"acceptedAnswerDate\\\":1685995656,\\\"acceptedAnswerId\\\":1686468,\\\"answers\\\":[{\\\"acceptedAnswerDate\\\":null,\\\"acceptedAnswerId\\\":null,\\\"cacheTimestamp\\\":null,\\\"closeReasonId\\\":null,\\\"comments\\\":[],\\\"communityOwnedDate\\\":null,\\\"confidenceScore\\\":null,\\\"contentInclusivityException\\\":null,\\\"contents\\\":\\\"A stack goes into the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state when AWS CloudFormation can't roll back all changes during an update.

This helps to keep your resources and workflow tidy. Since your BT101 application was created as a [Burner Application][10] on a burner account, the following resources will be automatically cleaned up after 7 days:\\\\n* Pipeline\\\\n* Version set and group\\\\n* Packages\\\\n* AWS account\\\\nHowever, if you wish to be frugal and clean up the resources ahead of time, then follow these steps:\\\\n1. Go to the [My Applications page][11].\\\\n2. Find your BT101 application, named `BT101_Username_` for first timers.\\\\n3. Click Start Cleanup in the right column, you will be redirected to the cleanup page.\\\\n4. Follow the onscreen instructions for cleaning up the application resources.\\\\n5. Go to [AWS Burner Accounts][12], find your BT101 account, and click the Close Account button.\\\\nNote\\\\nIf you encounter any issues, you can still access the [legacy manual instructions][13].\\\\n## Congratulations![¶][3]\\\\nYou’ve finally completed the lab and have cleaned up all your resources, congratulations!  Hopefully you had a good experience introducing yourself to some of the core development tools used at Amazon.\\\\nThere’s a lot more to learn, of course. In addition to the other topics in this section of BuilderHub, you can browse the [ASBX Tools][14] section for information and links that will help you understand and use many more of the tools that Builder Tools offers to you, a newly-minted Amazon Builder.\\\\nNote\\\\nIf you run into any trouble, there are many resources available to help you, listed on [ASBX support][15].\\\\n## Talk with your team[¶][4]\\\\nYour team may use a different toolchain than you used in BT 101—remember that this course was only meant to give you an overview of the software development lifecycle—your teammates can help you dive deeper into the tools you’ll use in your day-to-day work.\\\\n## Course completion and next steps[¶][5]\\\\n**This is the end of BT101: Building your first service**.

You will then practice a workflow you’ll likely follow regularly, i.e., making a change to your service and then beginning the process of releasing that change.\\\\n## Create a workspace[¶][2]\\\\nBrazil works within a local directory on your system called a Brazil _workspace_. The workspace contains the package(s) that you’re working on and their dependencies. If you work with only one package, it’s possible that you’ll need only a single workspace, but many developers use multiple workspaces. Your team will inform you of how their codebase is structured and help you get your dev environment configured, but for this module you’ll create a single workspace.\\\\n1. Connect to your Cloud Desktop if you are not already, all commands in this section will be run there.\\\\n2. Navigate to your [workplace][21] directory:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ncd ~/workplace\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nNote\\\\nIf this location doesn’t exist (it should be a symlink), then you probably didn’t go through [Set up your Brazil workplace][22]. Set it up now if you haven’t done so yet.\\\\n3. Within the `workplace`, create a Brazil [workspace][23] called `BT101` by using the Brazil CLI:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil workspace create --root BT101\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nThis creates, then sets up, the directory `~/workplace/BT101` to be the root of your new local workspace.\\\\nNote\\\\nIf you receive an exception error similar to: `Exceptiondetails:Permissiondenied@dir_s_mkdir-BT101(Errno::EACCES)`, see [brazil-build returns failure with error code EACCES][24] in the Brazil troubleshooting guide.\\\\n4. Go into the workspace you just created:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ncd BT101\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n5. To check out the details of your workspace, you could run `brazilworkspaceshow`, but the sub-command **workspace** can be shortened to **ws** for any commands that manipulate your workspace. Instead, just type:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil ws show\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nYou can see that the workspace was successfully created, but there is no assigned version set and there are no packages in it yet. You’ll fix that by first specifying the version set to use.\\\\n6. BuilderHub Create created a version set for us called `BT101_Username_/development`. Tell Brazil to use that versionset with your workspace:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil ws use --versionset BT101_Username_/development\\\\n```\\\\nImportant\\\\nBuilderHub Create created a version set featuring your _username_, but using an initial capital letter (for example, if my Amazon username is `frodob` the version set name above would be `BT101_Frodob_/development`).\\\\nIf you don’t specify the version set name **exactly**, the command will fail with `Couldn'tfindaversionsetnamed...`. If you see that error, then double-check the version set name you entered and make sure that it’s correct, _including capitalization_.\\\\nWhat is a version set?\\\\nA [version set][25] is a data structure that contains all of a package’s dependencies and their versions. A version set lets you precisely manage the packages your software project depends on. You can add new packages, update existing packages, and remove packages from a version set as your software’s dependencies change over time.\\\\n7. Next, you’ll add three packages to your workspace using the Brazil CLI. One package will contain your service’s code and unit tests, another will contain the CDK configuration to run your service, and the last will contain your service’s integration tests. You’ll work with the service code and unit tests in this step, and you’ll set up the integration tests later in the workshop.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil ws use --package BT101_Username_CDK\\\\nbrazil ws use --package BT101_Username_\\\\nbrazil ws use --package BT101_Username_Tests\\\\n```\\\\nWhat is a Brazil package?\\\\nA [package][26] is the smallest buildable/deployable unit. Packages are structured as code with similar functionality that should be built and deployed together, and is often a library that performs some function or an application that is actually run. External dependencies are declared in the package’s `Config` file, often called the “big C” or “capital C” config file because it is always capitalized.\\\\n8. After the package source containing your service’s code is downloaded, you’ll find it at `~/workplace/BT101/src/BT101_Username_`.\\\\nNote\\\\nThe packages that you `use` in your workspace are always located in its `src` directory. For more information about the structure of a local workspace, see [Workspace][27].\\\\n## Open your workspace in VS Code[¶][3]\\\\nNext, you’ll open your newly-created workspace in your IDE.\\\\nFor this workshop, you’ll be using VS Code as your integrated development environment (IDE). VS Code is a free, open-source code editor that offers a rich set of features such as syntax highlighting, an integrated terminal, and a vast library of extensions. It is one of the most popular IDEs in use at Amazon.\\\\nNote\\\\nTo foster a common onboarding process for all Amazonians, in this workshop you’ll use VS Code and the [Remote - SSH extension][28] to connect to your Cloud Desktop.\\\\nIn the future you may choose to use IntelliJ IDEA as your IDE, particularly if that is the standard for your team. You may also choose a different combination of local (laptop) and remote (Cloud Desktop) development, with different options for syncing files back and forth, depending on your preferences and needs for latency, computing power, etc.\\\\nNote\\\\nYou may have already installed VS Code via the `axeinitbuilder-tools` command if you are on a Mac laptop.\\\\n1. Install VS Code per the [IDE and plugin setup][29] documentation. Open the application.\\\\n2. Select Remote-SSH: Connect to Host… from the command palette, or click the SSH status button in the bottom-left corner of the IDE.\\\\n![../_images/remote-ssh-commands.png][30]![../_images/remote-status-bar.p\"},{\"url\":\"https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/learning/bt101-build-service/\",\"displayTitle\":\"BT101: Build your service\",\"domain\":\"builder_hub\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1755129600000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":5,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"Content\\\":\\\"# BT101: Build your service\\\\n# BT101: Build your service[¶][1]\\\\n* [Create a burner account][2]\\\\n* [Install the necessary tools on your Cloud Desktop and bootstrap your burner account][3]\\\\n* [Create your service with BuilderHub Create][4]\\\\n* [Post-conditions][5]\\\\n* [Learn more about packages and version sets][6]\\\\n* [Next][7]\\\\nTip\\\\nIf you get stuck and need help completing one of the Builder Tools 101 labs:\\\\n* Most errors that students encounter and report are due to **not completing the course prerequisites**. Make sure that you’ve followed [BT101: Prerequisites][8], including the important steps with regard to development permissions, filling out the “deemed export” form, and following the post-setup steps after creating your Cloud Desktop.\\\\n* Use the `@sage` command in the Amazon Q chat window for troubleshooting assistance that can analyze error messages, suggest solutions, and provide step-by-step guidance for resolving technical issues. Amazon Q Developer has access to the Amazon wiki, BuilderHub documentation, and Sage knowledge bases to provide internal Amazon guidance.\\\\n* If you’re still having issues, visit the [#sb-onboarding-help][9] Slack channel to search for a previously asked question or post your own.\\\\n**View the following video to prepare yourself for the course before starting the instructions!**\\\\n[BT 101 2022 - Video One - BT101 Intro][10]\\\\nIn this workshop, you’ll join a team responsible for building, maintaining, and supporting a web service that other Amazon teams use. To simulate your daily responsibilities, you’ll first create a service to work with, i.e., a calculator service that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\\\\nYou will use BuilderHub Create to create a service that you can then modify to practice the process followed by Amazon developers. BuilderHub Create is a service used to produce new applications by cloning fully-functional source applications using AWS resources (Lambda, S3, ECS, Fargate, etc.).\\\\nAs you go through this workshop, **read the instructions carefully**. The steps you perform today are the same steps you will be performing on a daily basis. Try to think through why you are running each command and what the command will do. If you’re ever not sure, ask the instructor or post in the [#sb-onboarding-help][9] Slack channel!\\\\nThe goal of the course is for you to understand how to produce and release code changes in a safe and scalable manner, not merely to complete the exercise. There is no prize for finishing first!\\\\nImportant\\\\n**Read this before you start**\\\\n* Before you begin these activities, make sure that you’ve followed the steps in [BT101: Prerequisites][8] first!\\\\n* Most commands you will run are case sensitive. Pay attention to the capitalization of the commands in the instructions, and match them when running the commands. The created resources will use CamelCase notation.\\\\n* Throughout this workshop, you will be asked to use your Amazon _username_ as part of a command. Replace all instances of `_username_` with your own username, following the capitalization of the text (e.g. `_username_` or `_Username_`). If your service was generated with a “V1” or similar tag at the end of your username, also add that tag when a username is required.\\\\n## Create a burner account[¶][2]\\\\nBefore you start building your service, you will need a way to log in to AWS. As a developer at Amazon, this is typically done through tools called Conduit and Isengard, but today you will be using a _burner account_—a short-lived AWS account that allows Amazon developers to experiment with AWS features; any resources created with the account are automatically cleaned up when the account is closed.\\\\n1. Go to [AWS Burner Accounts][11].\\\\n2. Create a new account by first providing an account name, which should follow the convention `_username_-bt101`. For example, _peccy-bt101_. Check the first checkbox to acknowledge that usage is not free (don’t worry, Amazon will be picking up the tab), the second checkbox to acknowledge that you will not be using the account for production purposes, and the third checkbox that you will not be using the account for personal or public facing use (you will be using the account for Amazon trainings).\\\\n![../_images/burner-create.png][12]\\\\n3. The account may take 5–15 minutes to create. Move on to the next step. You can refresh the window later to see the account ID or creation status.\\\\n## Install the necessary tools on your Cloud Desktop and bootstrap your burner account[¶][3]\\\\nRun all the commands in this section on your Cloud Desktop:\\\\n1. Make sure you’re authenticated on your Cloud Desktop by running:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nkinit && mwinit -o\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n2. Make sure you have the latest version of Builder Toolbox, which is a cross-platform tool for installing internal Amazon development tools:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ntoolbox update\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nIf you experience an error while running this, go to [Configure a Cloud Desktop][13] in the _Cloud Desktop User Guide_ and set up Builder Toolbox, which includes the Brazil CLI, BuilderHub Create, and CRUX.\\\\n3. _Verify_ that you have the necessary tools installed:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ntoolbox list --installed\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nYou should have the following tools installed:\\\\n**If you don’t**, then go back to [Set up common developer tools using AxE Initialize][14] and set them up _before proceeding_.\\\\n * `brazilcli`\\\\n * `cr`\\\\n * `create`\\\\n\\\\n4. Install AWS Developer Account (ADA):\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ntoolbox install ada\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n5. Add the `hub-create` registry to Builder Toolbox:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ntoolbox registry add s3://buildertoolbox-registry-hub-create-us-west-2/tools.json\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n6. Install `hub-create` using **toolbox**:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ntoolbox install hub-create\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n7. Next, you will need the AWS account ID from the burner account you created earlier. Switch back to the browser tab you used to create the account earlier, or navigate to [AWS Burner Accounts][11]. Copy the AWS account ID (note that the account ID is _numeric_ and differs from the _name_ of your account) from your active account, then bootstrap your account by executing:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nhub-create prepare -a _AccountID_\\\\n```\\\\nNote\\\\nIf you receive an error after executing the previous command similar to this:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nCould not fetch credentials from both Isengard, Conduit, or from environment.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nTry the following:\\\\n 1. Ensure you’re authenticated:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nkinit && mwinit -o\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n 2. Run the following command:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nada credentials update \\\\\\\\\\\\n --account=_AccountID_ \\\\\\\\\\\\n --provider=conduit \\\\\\\\\\\\n --role=IibsAdminAccess-DO-NOT-DELETE \\\\\\\\\\\\n --once\\\\n```\\\\n 3. Try to rerun:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nhub-create prepare -a _AccountID_\\\\n```\\\\n![../_images/burner-account-id.png][15]\\\\n8. Exit your SSH session, and then reconnect to reload the shell configuration.\\\\n## Create your service with BuilderHub Create[¶][4]\\\\nYou will be using BuilderHub Create to create a sample service running on AWS Lambda. BuilderHub Create enables you to quickly create a complete service using AWS technologies and Builder Tools recommended best practices. To create your service:\\\\n1. Go to [BuilderHub Create][16].\\\\n2. Click Create Application.\\\\n3. From the listed source applications, select BT101, then click Next (if you don’t see BT101 in the list of choices, start typing “bt101” in the search bar above the list, until the BT101 source application appears):\\\\n![../_images/bt101-srcapp-search.png][17]\\\\n4. In BT101 Configuration, provide your AWS account ID from the burner account you created earlier under Burner Account ID.\\\\n![../_images/fill-burner-account.png][18]\\\\n5. (Optional) You can click Verify by the AWS account ID field to confirm your Account is bootstrapped properly.\\\\n6. Your personal software bindle is auto-chosen for you. You don’t need to make any change on the Bindle form, but need to grant some permissions in your personal bindle by clicking Grant permissions to Create, then confirming the action on Grant New Permissions page .\\\\n![../_images/grand-bindle-permission.png][19]![../_images/bindle-permission-confirm.png][20]\\\\n7. Click Next to enter the review page, where you can review the BT101 resources (like packages, version set and pipeline) that BuilderHub Create is going to create for you. The BT101 application is created as a [Burner Application][21] with a 7-day lifetime which cannot be extended. After 7 days, all resources will be automatically \"},{\"url\":\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Millowm/Templates/Ramp-Training-Schedule/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Ramp-Training-Schedule\",\"domain\":\"wiki\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1702326240000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":6,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"error\\\",\\\"error\\\":\\\"Too many redirects\\\"}\"},{\"url\":\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/RTDS/WWTD/WWSI/CDO/prerequisites/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Prerequisites\",\"domain\":\"wiki\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1754051706000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":7,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"error\\\",\\\"error\\\":\\\"Too many redirects\\\"}\"},{\"url\":\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Acheron-ADC/Services/EC2/KDS/\",\"displayTitle\":\"KDS Overview\",\"domain\":\"wiki\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1701965812000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":8,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"error\\\",\\\"error\\\":\\\"Too many redirects\\\"}\"},{\"url\":\"https://sage.amazon.dev/posts/1686105\",\"displayTitle\":\"BT101 enable integration test erro\",\"domain\":\"sage_horde\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1746462288000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":9,\"categoryList\":[\"sage$BT101\"],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\",\\\"content\\\":{\\\"acceptedAnswerDate\\\":1685995656,\\\"acceptedAnswerId\\\":1686468,\\\"answers\\\":[{\\\"acceptedAnswerDate\\\":null,\\\"acceptedAnswerId\\\":null,\\\"cacheTimestamp\\\":null,\\\"closeReasonId\\\":null,\\\"comments\\\":[],\\\"communityOwnedDate\\\":null,\\\"confidenceScore\\\":null,\\\"contentInclusivityException\\\":null,\\\"contents\\\":\\\"A stack goes into the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state when AWS CloudFormation can't roll back all changes during an update.

Read the existing document skeleton\n2. Work through each section systematically\n3. Ask you specific questions to gather necessary information\n4. Draft content following Amazon's writing standards\n5.

Complete narrative document in Quip\n2. Executive summary (1-pager)\n3. Implementation roadmap\n4. Success metrics definition\n\n**Would you like me to proceed with developing this narrative? I'll start by asking targeted questions for each section to gather the necessary information.**"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":535,"cache_read_input_tokens":84540,"output_tokens":898}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"b929b345-a936-4d05-aad6-81b885fee982","timestamp":"2025-08-18T22:44:06.321Z"}

Industry best practices show that containerized development environments can reduce setup time by TK%, while automated provisioning can eliminate TK% of manual configuration errors.

Set User Preferences ==\\n\\nUser preferences are an **optional** portion of this guide, but setting them up can significantly enhance your DevSpaces experience. While not necessary for basic functionality, configuring preferences can optimize your workflow by:\\n\\n* Setting up common command aliases and mounting local files\\n* Pre-installing preferred toolbox tools\\n* Configuring launch settings for your preferred IDE or terminal\\n* Pre-installing your favorite VS Code extensions\\n\\n----\\n\\nNavigate to **[[My DevSpace Configuration>>https://devspaces.amazon.dev/configuration/personal||rel=\\\"_blank\\\"]] **to customize your DevSpace workflow according to your development preferences.\\n\\n=== Environment Bootstrapping ===\\n\\n**Step 1:** Specify a directory on the machine you plan to launch DevSpaces from to mount additional files or scripts into your DevSpace environment.\\n\\nFor example, if your configuration directory is: {{code}}~/devspaces-config{{/code}}, it will be mounted inside your DevSpace at: {{code}}~/devspaces-config{{/code}}.

With approximately **TK** new SDEs joining Amazon annually, this training serves as the critical gateway to developer productivity. Every new engineer must successfully complete BT101 to gain proficiency in essential tools including Brazil (build system), CRUX (code review), CDK (infrastructure as code), Apollo (deployment), and Pipelines (CI/CD).\n\nThe current BT101 process, last significantly updated in **TK**, requires each developer to navigate an extensive setup process before they can begin learning. This includes completing detailed prerequisites, manually configuring development environments, and ensuring proper access to multiple internal systems. While the training content itself delivers valuable knowledge, the path to get there has become increasingly complex as Amazon's toolchain has evolved.\n\nCurrently, new developers spend their first **TK** days primarily on setup and configuration rather than learning core development practices. This approach made sense when Amazon's engineering organization was smaller and tools were simpler. However, with our current scale of **TK** new hires per quarter and the availability of modern development environment technologies like DevSpaces, we have an opportunity to dramatically improve this experience.\n\nThe Builder Tools organization has consistently heard feedback through channels like #sb-onboarding-help (averaging **TK** messages daily) that the setup process is the most frustrating part of the onboarding experience. This feedback, combined with the strategic importance of developer productivity, makes addressing these challenges a priority.\n\n## Problem\n\nThe current BT101 onboarding process creates significant friction that delays new developer productivity and generates substantial support overhead.\n\n### Quantifiable Time Loss\n\nNew developers face multiple time-consuming barriers before they can begin actual learning:\n\n- **Prerequisites completion:** TK hours of documentation review and manual setup\n- **Tool installation and configuration:** TK hours across TK different tools\n- **Burner account creation:** 15-30 minute wait time (when systems are responsive)\n- **Environment troubleshooting:** TK% of students spend an additional TK hours debugging issues\n- **Total setup time:** TK-TK hours before meaningful learning begins\n\nWith TK new SDEs annually, this represents approximately **TK total hours** of lost productivity—equivalent to **TK full-time engineers** spending their entire year just on setup.\n\n### Primary Failure Points\n\nAnalysis of TK support tickets and Slack messages reveals consistent pain points:\n\n1. **Incomplete Prerequisites** - The #1 cause of student issues, accounting for TK% of support requests. Students frequently miss critical steps in the lengthy prerequisite documentation, leading to cascading failures during the workshop.\n\n2. **Environment Inconsistency** - Each developer's unique laptop configuration, operating system, and existing tool installations create TK different potential failure modes. What works on one developer's machine may fail mysteriously on another's.\n\n3. **Manual Process Errors** - Command-line typos, incorrect capitalization (e.g., \"bt101_username\" vs \"BT101_Username\"), and copy-paste errors cause TK% of initial setup failures.\n\n4. **Sequential Dependencies** - The current process requires strict ordering: step B cannot begin until step A completes successfully. A failure at any point blocks all subsequent progress.\n\n### Support Burden\n\nThe human cost extends beyond the new developers themselves:\n\n- **#sb-onboarding-help Slack channel:** Receives TK messages daily, with peak volumes of TK during high-hiring periods\n- **Volunteer trainers:** Spend an estimated TK hours weekly answering repetitive questions\n- **Team productivity:** New hire's teammates lose TK hours helping troubleshoot setup issues\n- **Most common questions (TK% of total):**\n  - \"Why is my build failing with 'permission denied'?\"\n  - \"My burner account creation is stuck\"\n  - \"Command not found: brazil\"\n  - \"Cannot find package in version set\"\n\n### Business Impact\n\nBeyond individual frustration, these inefficiencies have measurable business consequences:\n\n- **Delayed Feature Delivery:** At $TK per developer hour, the TK hours of setup time costs approximately $TK annually\n- **Reduced Initial Productivity:** Studies show that frustrating onboarding experiences reduce new hire productivity by TK% for their first TK days\n- **Increased Attrition Risk:** TK% of new SDEs cite poor onboarding experience as a factor in early attrition decisions\n- **Opportunity Cost:** Every hour spent on setup is an hour not spent learning Amazon's architectural patterns, security best practices, or team-specific systems\n\n### The Opportunity\n\nModern development environment technologies and automation practices offer a clear path forward. Industry best practices show that containerized development environments can reduce setup time by TK%, while automated provisioning can eliminate TK% of manual configuration errors. By applying these solutions to BT101, we can transform a multi-hour setup marathon into a few-minute automated process, allowing new developers to focus on what matters: learning to build great software at Amazon scale.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":95,"oldLines":4,"newStart":95,"newLines":6,"lines":[" "," ### The Opportunity"," ","-Modern development environment technologies and automation practices offer a clear path forward.

With approximately **TK** new SDEs joining Amazon annually, this training serves as the critical gateway to developer productivity. Every new engineer must successfully complete BT101 to gain proficiency in essential tools including Brazil (build system), CRUX (code review), CDK (infrastructure as code), Apollo (deployment), and Pipelines (CI/CD).\n\nThe current BT101 process, last significantly updated in **TK**, requires each developer to navigate an extensive setup process before they can begin learning. This includes completing detailed prerequisites, manually configuring development environments, and ensuring proper access to multiple internal systems. While the training content itself delivers valuable knowledge, the path to get there has become increasingly complex as Amazon's toolchain has evolved.\n\nCurrently, new developers spend their first **TK** days primarily on setup and configuration rather than learning core development practices. This approach made sense when Amazon's engineering organization was smaller and tools were simpler. However, with our current scale of **TK** new hires per quarter and the availability of modern development environment technologies like DevSpaces, we have an opportunity to dramatically improve this experience.\n\nThe Builder Tools organization has consistently heard feedback through channels like #sb-onboarding-help (averaging **TK** messages daily) that the setup process is the most frustrating part of the onboarding experience. This feedback, combined with the strategic importance of developer productivity, makes addressing these challenges a priority.\n\n## Problem\n\nThe current BT101 onboarding process creates significant friction that delays new developer productivity and generates substantial support overhead.\n\n### Quantifiable Time Loss\n\nNew developers face multiple time-consuming barriers before they can begin actual learning:\n\n- **Prerequisites completion:** TK hours of documentation review and manual setup\n- **Tool installation and configuration:** TK hours across TK different tools\n- **Burner account creation:** 15-30 minute wait time (when systems are responsive)\n- **Environment troubleshooting:** TK% of students spend an additional TK hours debugging issues\n- **Total setup time:** TK-TK hours before meaningful learning begins\n\nWith TK new SDEs annually, this represents approximately **TK total hours** of lost productivity—equivalent to **TK full-time engineers** spending their entire year just on setup.\n\n### Primary Failure Points\n\nAnalysis of TK support tickets and Slack messages reveals consistent pain points:\n\n1. **Incomplete Prerequisites** - The #1 cause of student issues, accounting for TK% of support requests. Students frequently miss critical steps in the lengthy prerequisite documentation, leading to cascading failures during the workshop.\n\n2. **Environment Inconsistency** - Each developer's unique laptop configuration, operating system, and existing tool installations create TK different potential failure modes. What works on one developer's machine may fail mysteriously on another's.\n\n3. **Manual Process Errors** - Command-line typos, incorrect capitalization (e.g., \"bt101_username\" vs \"BT101_Username\"), and copy-paste errors cause TK% of initial setup failures.\n\n4. **Sequential Dependencies** - The current process requires strict ordering: step B cannot begin until step A completes successfully. A failure at any point blocks all subsequent progress.\n\n### Support Burden\n\nThe human cost extends beyond the new developers themselves:\n\n- **#sb-onboarding-help Slack channel:** Receives TK messages daily, with peak volumes of TK during high-hiring periods\n- **Volunteer trainers:** Spend an estimated TK hours weekly answering repetitive questions\n- **Team productivity:** New hire's teammates lose TK hours helping troubleshoot setup issues\n- **Most common questions (TK% of total):**\n  - \"Why is my build failing with 'permission denied'?\"\n  - \"My burner account creation is stuck\"\n  - \"Command not found: brazil\"\n  - \"Cannot find package in version set\"\n\n### Business Impact\n\nBeyond individual frustration, these inefficiencies have measurable business consequences:\n\n- **Delayed Feature Delivery:** At $TK per developer hour, the TK hours of setup time costs approximately $TK annually\n- **Reduced Initial Productivity:** Studies show that frustrating onboarding experiences reduce new hire productivity by TK% for their first TK days\n- **Increased Attrition Risk:** TK% of new SDEs cite poor onboarding experience as a factor in early attrition decisions\n- **Opportunity Cost:** Every hour spent on setup is an hour not spent learning Amazon's architectural patterns, security best practices, or team-specific systems\n\n### The Opportunity\n\nDevSpaces, Amazon's rapidly launching pre-configured developer environment solution, offers a proven path forward. DevSpaces provides builders with a development setup that \"just works\" in **under 30 seconds**—a dramatic improvement from the current multi-hour BT101 setup process. With DevSpaces' blueprint-based approach, we can create standardized BT101 environments that include all necessary tools, dependencies, and configurations, completely eliminating manual setup errors and environment inconsistencies.\n\nThe DevSpaces team has already identified similar use cases across Amazon, noting scenarios where developers lose 15+ minutes waiting for environments during on-call incidents, code reviews, and cross-team investigations.

With approximately **TK** new SDEs joining Amazon annually, this training serves as the critical gateway to developer productivity. Every new engineer must successfully complete BT101 to gain proficiency in essential tools including Brazil (build system), CRUX (code review), CDK (infrastructure as code), Apollo (deployment), and Pipelines (CI/CD).\n\nThe current BT101 process, last significantly updated in **TK**, requires each developer to navigate an extensive setup process before they can begin learning. This includes completing detailed prerequisites, manually configuring development environments, and ensuring proper access to multiple internal systems. While the training content itself delivers valuable knowledge, the path to get there has become increasingly complex as Amazon's toolchain has evolved.\n\nCurrently, new developers spend their first **TK** days primarily on setup and configuration rather than learning core development practices. This approach made sense when Amazon's engineering organization was smaller and tools were simpler. However, with our current scale of **TK** new hires per quarter and the availability of modern development environment technologies like DevSpaces, we have an opportunity to dramatically improve this experience.\n\nThe Builder Tools organization has consistently heard feedback through channels like #sb-onboarding-help (averaging **TK** messages daily) that the setup process is the most frustrating part of the onboarding experience. This feedback, combined with the strategic importance of developer productivity, makes addressing these challenges a priority.\n\n## Problem\n\nThe current BT101 onboarding process creates significant friction that delays new developer productivity and generates substantial support overhead.\n\n### Quantifiable Time Loss\n\nNew developers face multiple time-consuming barriers before they can begin actual learning:\n\n- **Prerequisites completion:** TK hours of documentation review and manual setup\n- **Tool installation and configuration:** TK hours across TK different tools\n- **Burner account creation:** 15-30 minute wait time (when systems are responsive)\n- **Environment troubleshooting:** TK% of students spend an additional TK hours debugging issues\n- **Total setup time:** TK-TK hours before meaningful learning begins\n\nWith TK new SDEs annually, this represents approximately **TK total hours** of lost productivity—equivalent to **TK full-time engineers** spending their entire year just on setup.\n\n### Primary Failure Points\n\nAnalysis of TK support tickets and Slack messages reveals consistent pain points:\n\n1. **Incomplete Prerequisites** - The #1 cause of student issues, accounting for TK% of support requests. Students frequently miss critical steps in the lengthy prerequisite documentation, leading to cascading failures during the workshop.\n\n2. **Environment Inconsistency** - Each developer's unique laptop configuration, operating system, and existing tool installations create TK different potential failure modes. What works on one developer's machine may fail mysteriously on another's.\n\n3. **Manual Process Errors** - Command-line typos, incorrect capitalization (e.g., \"bt101_username\" vs \"BT101_Username\"), and copy-paste errors cause TK% of initial setup failures.\n\n4. **Sequential Dependencies** - The current process requires strict ordering: step B cannot begin until step A completes successfully. A failure at any point blocks all subsequent progress.\n\n### Support Burden\n\nThe human cost extends beyond the new developers themselves:\n\n- **#sb-onboarding-help Slack channel:** Receives TK messages daily, with peak volumes of TK during high-hiring periods\n- **Volunteer trainers:** Spend an estimated TK hours weekly answering repetitive questions\n- **Team productivity:** New hire's teammates lose TK hours helping troubleshoot setup issues\n- **Most common questions (TK% of total):**\n  - \"Why is my build failing with 'permission denied'?\"\n  - \"My burner account creation is stuck\"\n  - \"Command not found: brazil\"\n  - \"Cannot find package in version set\"\n\n### Business Impact\n\nBeyond individual frustration, these inefficiencies have measurable business consequences:\n\n- **Delayed Feature Delivery:** At $TK per developer hour, the TK hours of setup time costs approximately $TK annually\n- **Reduced Initial Productivity:** Studies show that frustrating onboarding experiences reduce new hire productivity by TK% for their first TK days\n- **Increased Attrition Risk:** TK% of new SDEs cite poor onboarding experience as a factor in early attrition decisions\n- **Opportunity Cost:** Every hour spent on setup is an hour not spent learning Amazon's architectural patterns, security best practices, or team-specific systems\n\n### The Opportunity\n\nDevSpaces, Amazon's rapidly launching pre-configured developer environment solution, offers a proven path forward. DevSpaces provides builders with a development setup that \"just works\" in **under 30 seconds**—a dramatic improvement from the current multi-hour BT101 setup process. With DevSpaces' blueprint-based approach, we can create standardized BT101 environments that include all necessary tools, dependencies, and configurations, completely eliminating manual setup errors and environment inconsistencies.\n\nThe DevSpaces team has already identified similar use cases across Amazon, noting scenarios where developers lose 15+ minutes waiting for environments during on-call incidents, code reviews, and cross-team investigations. By applying DevSpaces to BT101, we can transform the current multi-hour setup marathon into a sub-minute automated process, allowing new developers to focus on what matters: learning to build great software at Amazon scale.\n\n## Proposal\n\n### Leverage DevSpaces for Instant BT101 Environments\n\nWe propose creating a standardized BT101 DevSpace blueprint that includes:\n\n**Pre-configured Components:**\n- All Brazil CLI tools and configurations\n- BuilderHub Create with proper permissions\n- CRUX setup for code reviews\n- AWS CLI with pre-configured profiles\n- CDK and testing frameworks\n- Auto-generated burner account credentials\n\n**Automation Through Embark Integration:**\n- Trigger BT101 DevSpace creation automatically when new hires join\n- Pre-populate personal bindles with necessary source code access\n- Auto-provision burner accounts from a pre-created pool\n- Eliminate the current prerequisite documentation entirely\n\n### Expected Outcomes\n\n- **Setup time reduction:** From TK hours to under 1 minute\n- **Support ticket reduction:** Estimated TK% decrease in #sb-onboarding-help volume\n- **First-day productivity:** New SDEs writing code within their first hour\n- **Consistency guarantee:** 100% identical environments eliminating \"works on my machine\" issues\n- **Cost savings:** $TK annually from reduced setup time and support overhead","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":125,"oldLines":4,"newStart":125,"newLines":77,"lines":[" -

With approximately **TK** new SDEs joining Amazon annually, this training serves as the critical gateway to developer productivity. Every new engineer must successfully complete BT101 to gain proficiency in essential tools including Brazil (build system), CRUX (code review), CDK (infrastructure as code), Apollo (deployment), and Pipelines (CI/CD).\n\nThe current BT101 process, last significantly updated in **TK**, requires each developer to navigate an extensive setup process before they can begin learning. This includes completing detailed prerequisites, manually configuring development environments, and ensuring proper access to multiple internal systems. While the training content itself delivers valuable knowledge, the path to get there has become increasingly complex as Amazon's toolchain has evolved.\n\nCurrently, new developers spend their first **TK** days primarily on setup and configuration rather than learning core development practices. This approach made sense when Amazon's engineering organization was smaller and tools were simpler. However, with our current scale of **TK** new hires per quarter and the availability of modern development environment technologies like DevSpaces, we have an opportunity to dramatically improve this experience.\n\nThe Builder Tools organization has consistently heard feedback through channels like #sb-onboarding-help (averaging **TK** messages daily) that the setup process is the most frustrating part of the onboarding experience. This feedback, combined with the strategic importance of developer productivity, makes addressing these challenges a priority.\n\n## Problem\n\nThe current BT101 onboarding process creates significant friction that delays new developer productivity and generates substantial support overhead.\n\n### Quantifiable Time Loss\n\nNew developers face multiple time-consuming barriers before they can begin actual learning:\n\n- **Prerequisites completion:** TK hours of documentation review and manual setup\n- **Tool installation and configuration:** TK hours across TK different tools\n- **Burner account creation:** 15-30 minute wait time (when systems are responsive)\n- **Environment troubleshooting:** TK% of students spend an additional TK hours debugging issues\n- **Total setup time:** TK-TK hours before meaningful learning begins\n\nWith TK new SDEs annually, this represents approximately **TK total hours** of lost productivity—equivalent to **TK full-time engineers** spending their entire year just on setup.\n\n### Primary Failure Points\n\nAnalysis of TK support tickets and Slack messages reveals consistent pain points:\n\n1. **Incomplete Prerequisites** - The #1 cause of student issues, accounting for TK% of support requests. Students frequently miss critical steps in the lengthy prerequisite documentation, leading to cascading failures during the workshop.\n\n2. **Environment Inconsistency** - Each developer's unique laptop configuration, operating system, and existing tool installations create TK different potential failure modes. What works on one developer's machine may fail mysteriously on another's.\n\n3. **Manual Process Errors** - Command-line typos, incorrect capitalization (e.g., \"bt101_username\" vs \"BT101_Username\"), and copy-paste errors cause TK% of initial setup failures.\n\n4. **Sequential Dependencies** - The current process requires strict ordering: step B cannot begin until step A completes successfully. A failure at any point blocks all subsequent progress.\n\n### Support Burden\n\nThe human cost extends beyond the new developers themselves:\n\n- **#sb-onboarding-help Slack channel:** Receives TK messages daily, with peak volumes of TK during high-hiring periods\n- **Volunteer trainers:** Spend an estimated TK hours weekly answering repetitive questions\n- **Team productivity:** New hire's teammates lose TK hours helping troubleshoot setup issues\n- **Most common questions (TK% of total):**\n  - \"Why is my build failing with 'permission denied'?\"\n  - \"My burner account creation is stuck\"\n  - \"Command not found: brazil\"\n  - \"Cannot find package in version set\"\n\n### Business Impact\n\nBeyond individual frustration, these inefficiencies have measurable business consequences:\n\n- **Delayed Feature Delivery:** At $TK per developer hour, the TK hours of setup time costs approximately $TK annually\n- **Reduced Initial Productivity:** Studies show that frustrating onboarding experiences reduce new hire productivity by TK% for their first TK days\n- **Increased Attrition Risk:** TK% of new SDEs cite poor onboarding experience as a factor in early attrition decisions\n- **Opportunity Cost:** Every hour spent on setup is an hour not spent learning Amazon's architectural patterns, security best practices, or team-specific systems\n\n### The Opportunity\n\nDevSpaces, Amazon's rapidly launching pre-configured developer environment solution, offers a proven path forward. DevSpaces provides builders with a development setup that \"just works\" in **under 30 seconds**—a dramatic improvement from the current multi-hour BT101 setup process. With DevSpaces' blueprint-based approach, we can create standardized BT101 environments that include all necessary tools, dependencies, and configurations, completely eliminating manual setup errors and environment inconsistencies.\n\nThe DevSpaces team has already identified similar use cases across Amazon, noting scenarios where developers lose 15+ minutes waiting for environments during on-call incidents, code reviews, and cross-team investigations. By applying DevSpaces to BT101, we can transform the current multi-hour setup marathon into a sub-minute automated process, allowing new developers to focus on what matters: learning to build great software at Amazon scale.\n\n## Proposal\n\n### Leverage DevSpaces for Instant BT101 Environments\n\nWe propose creating a standardized BT101 DevSpace blueprint that includes:\n\n**Pre-configured Components:**\n- All Brazil CLI tools and configurations\n- BuilderHub Create with proper permissions\n- CRUX setup for code reviews\n- AWS CLI with pre-configured profiles\n- CDK and testing frameworks\n- Auto-generated burner account credentials\n\n**Automation Through Embark Integration:**\n- Trigger BT101 DevSpace creation automatically when new hires join\n- Pre-populate personal bindles with necessary source code access\n- Auto-provision burner accounts from a pre-created pool\n- Eliminate the current prerequisite documentation entirely\n\n### Expected Outcomes\n\n- **Setup time reduction:** From TK hours to under 1 minute\n- **Support ticket reduction:** Estimated TK% decrease in #sb-onboarding-help volume\n- **First-day productivity:** New SDEs writing code within their first hour\n- **Consistency guarantee:** 100% identical environments eliminating \"works on my machine\" issues\n- **Cost savings:** $TK annually from reduced setup time and support overhead\n\n## Open Questions\n\nBased on the action items from our initial analysis, several key questions need to be addressed to move forward with this proposal:\n\n### DevSpaces Integration\n\n1. **DevSpaces Readiness for Training:** \n   - Can DevSpaces handle the scale of simultaneous BT101 sessions during peak hiring periods?\n   - What is the timeline for DevSpaces GA release and stability guarantees?\n   - How do we handle DevSpaces outages during critical training sessions?\n\n2. **Blueprint Management:**\n   - Who will own and maintain the BT101 DevSpace blueprint?\n   - How frequently should the blueprint be updated as tools evolve?\n   - Can we version blueprints to support different BT101 variations?\n\n### Automation and Provisioning\n\n3. **Embark Hook Implementation:**\n   - What technical barriers exist for integrating with the new hire Embark workflow?\n   - How do we handle edge cases where automatic provisioning fails?\n   - What fallback mechanisms should be in place?\n\n4. **Personal Bindle Auto-Population:**\n   - How do we automatically grant source code access to new hire personal bindles?\n   - What security reviews are required for automated permission grants?\n   - How do we handle contractors or temporary employees with different access levels?\n\n### Burner Account Management\n\n5. **Automated Burner Account Creation:**\n   - Can we create a pool of pre-provisioned burner accounts for instant assignment?\n   - How do we handle account cleanup after training completion?\n   - What are the cost implications of maintaining a burner account pool?\n\n6. **Account Bootstrap Automation:**\n   - Can the manual bootstrap process be fully automated?\n   - How do we handle AWS service limits during bulk account creation?\n   - What monitoring is needed to ensure account health?\n\n### Organizational Considerations\n\n7. **Team Ownership:**\n   - Should this be owned by the Builder Tools team, Training team, or a joint effort?\n   - How do we coordinate between DevSpaces, BuilderHub, and BT101 teams?\n   - Who provides ongoing support for the quickstart infrastructure?\n\n8. **Migration Strategy:**\n   - How do we transition from the current BT101 process to the DevSpaces-based approach?\n   - Should we run both systems in parallel during transition?\n   - How do we update all existing documentation and training materials?\n\n### Technical Constraints\n\n9. **Generic Burner Applications:**\n   -

With approximately **TK** new SDEs joining Amazon annually, this training serves as the critical gateway to developer productivity. Every new engineer must successfully complete BT101 to gain proficiency in essential tools including Brazil (build system), CRUX (code review), CDK (infrastructure as code), Apollo (deployment), and Pipelines (CI/CD).\n\nThe current BT101 process, last significantly updated in **TK**, requires each developer to navigate an extensive setup process before they can begin learning. This includes completing detailed prerequisites, manually configuring development environments, and ensuring proper access to multiple internal systems. While the training content itself delivers valuable knowledge, the path to get there has become increasingly complex as Amazon's toolchain has evolved.\n\nCurrently, new developers spend their first **TK** days primarily on setup and configuration rather than learning core development practices. This approach made sense when Amazon's engineering organization was smaller and tools were simpler. However, with our current scale of **TK** new hires per quarter and the availability of modern development environment technologies like DevSpaces, we have an opportunity to dramatically improve this experience.\n\nThe Builder Tools organization has consistently heard feedback through channels like #sb-onboarding-help (averaging **TK** messages daily) that the setup process is the most frustrating part of the onboarding experience. This feedback, combined with the strategic importance of developer productivity, makes addressing these challenges a priority.\n\n## Problem\n\nThe current BT101 onboarding process creates significant friction that delays new developer productivity and generates substantial support overhead.\n\n### Quantifiable Time Loss\n\nNew developers face multiple time-consuming barriers before they can begin actual learning:\n\n- **Prerequisites completion:** TK hours of documentation review and manual setup\n- **Tool installation and configuration:** TK hours across TK different tools\n- **Burner account creation:** 15-30 minute wait time (when systems are responsive)\n- **Environment troubleshooting:** TK% of students spend an additional TK hours debugging issues\n- **Total setup time:** TK-TK hours before meaningful learning begins\n\nWith TK new SDEs annually, this represents approximately **TK total hours** of lost productivity—equivalent to **TK full-time engineers** spending their entire year just on setup.\n\n### Primary Failure Points\n\nAnalysis of TK support tickets and Slack messages reveals consistent pain points:\n\n1. **Incomplete Prerequisites** - The #1 cause of student issues, accounting for TK% of support requests. Students frequently miss critical steps in the lengthy prerequisite documentation, leading to cascading failures during the workshop.\n\n2. **Environment Inconsistency** - Each developer's unique laptop configuration, operating system, and existing tool installations create TK different potential failure modes. What works on one developer's machine may fail mysteriously on another's.\n\n3. **Manual Process Errors** - Command-line typos, incorrect capitalization (e.g., \"bt101_username\" vs \"BT101_Username\"), and copy-paste errors cause TK% of initial setup failures.\n\n4. **Sequential Dependencies** - The current process requires strict ordering: step B cannot begin until step A completes successfully. A failure at any point blocks all subsequent progress.\n\n### Support Burden\n\nThe human cost extends beyond the new developers themselves:\n\n- **#sb-onboarding-help Slack channel:** Receives TK messages daily, with peak volumes of TK during high-hiring periods\n- **Volunteer trainers:** Spend an estimated TK hours weekly answering repetitive questions\n- **Team productivity:** New hire's teammates lose TK hours helping troubleshoot setup issues\n- **Most common questions (TK% of total):**\n  - \"Why is my build failing with 'permission denied'?\"\n  - \"My burner account creation is stuck\"\n  - \"Command not found: brazil\"\n  - \"Cannot find package in version set\"\n\n### Business Impact\n\nBeyond individual frustration, these inefficiencies have measurable business consequences:\n\n- **Delayed Feature Delivery:** At $TK per developer hour, the TK hours of setup time costs approximately $TK annually\n- **Reduced Initial Productivity:** Studies show that frustrating onboarding experiences reduce new hire productivity by TK% for their first TK days\n- **Increased Attrition Risk:** TK% of new SDEs cite poor onboarding experience as a factor in early attrition decisions\n- **Opportunity Cost:** Every hour spent on setup is an hour not spent learning Amazon's architectural patterns, security best practices, or team-specific systems\n\n### The Opportunity\n\nDevSpaces, Amazon's rapidly launching pre-configured developer environment solution, offers a proven path forward. DevSpaces provides builders with a development setup that \"just works\" in **under 30 seconds**—a dramatic improvement from the current multi-hour BT101 setup process. With DevSpaces' blueprint-based approach, we can create standardized BT101 environments that include all necessary tools, dependencies, and configurations, completely eliminating manual setup errors and environment inconsistencies.\n\nThe DevSpaces team has already identified similar use cases across Amazon, noting scenarios where developers lose 15+ minutes waiting for environments during on-call incidents, code reviews, and cross-team investigations. By applying DevSpaces to BT101, we can transform the current multi-hour setup marathon into a sub-minute automated process, allowing new developers to focus on what matters: learning to build great software at Amazon scale.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe propose a two-pronged approach to eliminate BT101 setup friction:\n\n### 1. Provide DevSpaces Instead of Manual Environment Setup\n\nReplace the current manual environment configuration process with pre-configured DevSpaces that builders can launch instantly:\n\n**DevSpace Blueprint for BT101:**\n- Pre-installed Brazil CLI tools and configurations\n- BuilderHub Create with proper authentication\n- CRUX setup for code reviews\n- AWS CLI and CDK frameworks\n- All testing tools and dependencies\n- Eliminates the entire prerequisites documentation\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Launch time: Under 30 seconds vs current TK hours\n- Zero configuration errors\n- Consistent environments for all participants\n- No \"works on my machine\" issues\n\n### 2. Pre-create BT101 Applications During Onboarding\n\nWork separately to automatically provision BT101 resources when builders are hired:\n\n**Automated Provisioning at Hire Time:**\n- Create BT101 application in new hire's personal bindle during onboarding\n- Pre-provision burner AWS account from a managed pool\n- Bootstrap account with necessary permissions and resources\n- Have everything ready before the builder starts BT101\n\n**Implementation Approach:**\n- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):** Create and test BT101 DevSpace blueprint\n- **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):** Pilot with next cohort of new hires\n- **Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12):** Implement automated BT101 app creation in onboarding workflow\n- **Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16):** Scale burner account pool and automation\n\n### Expected Outcomes\n\n- **Setup time reduction:** From TK hours to under 1 minute\n- **Support ticket reduction:** Estimated TK% decrease in #sb-onboarding-help volume\n- **First-day productivity:** New SDEs writing code within their first hour\n- **Consistency guarantee:** 100% identical environments eliminating \"works on my machine\" issues\n- **Cost savings:** $TK annually from reduced setup time and support overhead\n\n## Open Questions\n\nBased on the action items from our initial analysis, several key questions need to be addressed to move forward with this proposal:\n\n### DevSpaces Integration\n\n1. **DevSpaces Readiness for Training:** \n   - Can DevSpaces handle the scale of simultaneous BT101 sessions during peak hiring periods?\n   - What is the timeline for DevSpaces GA release and stability guarantees?\n   - How do we handle DevSpaces outages during critical training sessions?\n\n2. **Blueprint Management:**\n   - Who will own and maintain the BT101 DevSpace blueprint?\n   - How frequently should the blueprint be updated as tools evolve?\n   - Can we version blueprints to support different BT101 variations?\n\n### Automation and Provisioning\n\n3. **Embark Hook Implementation:**\n   - What technical barriers exist for integrating with the new hire Embark workflow?\n   - How do we handle edge cases where automatic provisioning fails?\n   - What fallback mechanisms should be in place?\n\n4. **Personal Bindle Auto-Population:**\n   - How do we automatically grant source code access to new hire personal bindles?\n   - What security reviews are required for automated permission grants?\n   - How do we handle contractors or temporary employees with different access levels?\n\n### Burner Account Management\n\n5. **Automated Burner Account Creation:**\n   - Can we create a pool of pre-provisioned burner accounts for instant assignment?\n   - How do we handle account cleanup after training completion?\n   - What are the cost implications of maintaining a burner account pool?\n\n6. **Account Bootstrap Automation:**\n   - Can the manual bootstrap process be fully automated?\n   - How do we handle AWS service limits during bulk account creation?\n   - What monitoring is needed to ensure account health?\n\n### Organizational Considerations\n\n7. **Team Ownership:**\n   - Should this be owned by the Builder Tools team, Training team, or a joint effort?\n   - How do we coordinate between DevSpaces, BuilderHub, and BT101 teams?\n   - Who provides ongoing support for the quickstart infrastructure?\n\n8. **Migration Strategy:**\n   - How do we transition from the current BT101 process to the DevSpaces-based approach?\n   - Should we run both systems in parallel during transition?\n   - How do we update all existing documentation and training materials?\n\n### Technical Constraints\n\n9. **Generic Burner Applications:**\n   - Can we create generic burner applications that work for all new hires?\n   - How do we handle team-specific customizations or requirements?\n   - What about fleet owner permissions and resource allocation?\n\n10. **Scalability and Performance:**\n    - What is the maximum number of concurrent DevSpaces we can support?\n    - How do we ensure consistent performance during high-volume periods?\n    - What infrastructure investments are needed to support this scale?\n\n### Success Metrics\n\n11. **Measurement and Validation:**\n    - How do we measure success beyond setup time reduction?\n    - What metrics should we track for continuous improvement?\n    - How do we gather feedback from new hires using the new system?\n\nThese questions need to be addressed through collaboration with the DevSpaces team, BuilderHub, Embark owners, and AWS account management teams to ensure a successful implementation of the BT101 Quickstart initiative.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":130,"oldLines":12,"newStart":130,"newLines":6,"lines":[" -

We are requesting approval to proceed with the proposed implementation plan and allocation of resources for a Q3 launch.\n\n## Background\nOur current customer service model relies exclusively on human agents handling inquiries through phone, email, and live chat during business hours (8am-8pm ET). Customer satisfaction surveys indicate that 62% of customers are frustrated by wait times averaging 15 minutes during peak periods, and 78% expect immediate assistance outside business hours. Additionally, our customer service costs have increased 18% year-over-year due to growing inquiry volume.\n\n## Problem\nCustomers are experiencing significant friction in getting timely support for common inquiries, leading to:\n1. Decreased customer satisfaction (CSAT scores dropped from 4.2 to 3.8 in the past year)\n2. Abandoned carts (28% of customers abandon purchases when they can't get immediate help)\n3. Increased support costs ($3.2M annually, growing at 18% YoY)\n\nData shows that 70% of customer inquiries fall into predictable categories (order status, returns, product information) that could be effectively handled through automated systems.\n\n## Recommendation\nImplement an AI-powered customer service chatbot on our retail website that:\n1. Provides 24/7 instant responses to common customer inquiries\n2. Seamlessly escalates complex issues to human agents\n3. Continuously improves through machine learning based on customer interactions\n\nOur analysis of three potential solutions (detailed in Appendix A) shows that the Amazon Lex-based solution offers the best combination of capabilities, integration with existing systems, and cost-effectiveness. Implementation costs are estimated at $450K with projected annual savings of $1.2M and a 4.5-month ROI.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Week 1-2: Finalize technical requirements and vendor selection (Owner: Jane Smith)\n2. Week 3-6: Develop and train initial chatbot model (Owner: AI Team)\n3. Week 7-8: Internal testing and refinement (Owner: QA Team)\n4. Week 9-10: Limited customer beta (Owner: Customer Experience Team)\n5. Week 11-12: Full deployment and monitoring (Owner: Operations Team)\n\nWe request leadership approval to proceed with this implementation plan and allocation of the $450K budget by June 15th to ensure Q3 launch.\n\n## FAQ\nQ: How will this affect our current customer service team?\nA: No layoffs are planned. The chatbot will handle routine inquiries, allowing our agents to focus on complex issues requiring human judgment and empathy.\n\nQ: What is the expected customer adoption rate?\nA: Based on industry benchmarks and our customer behavior analysis, we expect 65% of customers to utilize the chatbot for initial inquiries within 3 months of launch.\n\n## Appendices\nAppendix A: Solution Comparison Analysis\nAppendix B: Detailed Cost Projections and ROI Analysis\nAppendix C: Customer Survey Data\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Lack of Specific Data\nIf the user lacks specific data to support their narrative:\n- The model SHOULD suggest types of data that would strengthen their argument\n- The model SHOULD help identify potential sources for this data\n- The model SHOULD suggest framing the narrative to acknowledge data limitations while still making a compelling case\n\n### Unclear Purpose or Recommendation\nIf the user is struggling to articulate a clear purpose or recommendation:\n- The model SHOULD ask targeted questions to help clarify their thinking\n- The model SHOULD suggest potential frameworks for structuring their recommendation\n- The model SHOULD provide examples of well-framed purpose statements or recommendations\n\n### Document Length Issues\nIf the document becomes excessively long:\n- The model SHOULD suggest moving detailed information to appendices\n- The model SHOULD help identify redundant content that can be removed\n- The model SHOULD suggest ways to make language more concise\n- The model SHOULD remind the user that Amazon values brevity and directness\n\n### Balancing Multiple Stakeholder Needs\nIf the user needs to address multiple stakeholder perspectives:\n- The model SHOULD suggest organizing the recommendation to address key concerns of each stakeholder group\n- The model SHOULD help identify common ground across stakeholder groups\n- The model SHOULD suggest using the FAQ section to address stakeholder-specific concerns\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":30,"oldLines":7,"newStart":30,"newLines":7,"lines":["   - Tenets (if applicable)","   - Background","   - Problem/Opportunity","-  - Recommendation","+  - Recommendation (without implementation details unless specifically requested)","   - Next Steps","   - Optional Sections (Summary, FAQs)","   - Appendices"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

We are requesting approval to proceed with the proposed implementation plan and allocation of resources for a Q3 launch.\n\n## Background\nOur current customer service model relies exclusively on human agents handling inquiries through phone, email, and live chat during business hours (8am-8pm ET). Customer satisfaction surveys indicate that 62% of customers are frustrated by wait times averaging 15 minutes during peak periods, and 78% expect immediate assistance outside business hours. Additionally, our customer service costs have increased 18% year-over-year due to growing inquiry volume.\n\n## Problem\nCustomers are experiencing significant friction in getting timely support for common inquiries, leading to:\n1. Decreased customer satisfaction (CSAT scores dropped from 4.2 to 3.8 in the past year)\n2. Abandoned carts (28% of customers abandon purchases when they can't get immediate help)\n3. Increased support costs ($3.2M annually, growing at 18% YoY)\n\nData shows that 70% of customer inquiries fall into predictable categories (order status, returns, product information) that could be effectively handled through automated systems.\n\n## Recommendation\nImplement an AI-powered customer service chatbot on our retail website that:\n1. Provides 24/7 instant responses to common customer inquiries\n2. Seamlessly escalates complex issues to human agents\n3. Continuously improves through machine learning based on customer interactions\n\nOur analysis of three potential solutions (detailed in Appendix A) shows that the Amazon Lex-based solution offers the best combination of capabilities, integration with existing systems, and cost-effectiveness. Implementation costs are estimated at $450K with projected annual savings of $1.2M and a 4.5-month ROI.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Week 1-2: Finalize technical requirements and vendor selection (Owner: Jane Smith)\n2. Week 3-6: Develop and train initial chatbot model (Owner: AI Team)\n3. Week 7-8: Internal testing and refinement (Owner: QA Team)\n4. Week 9-10: Limited customer beta (Owner: Customer Experience Team)\n5. Week 11-12: Full deployment and monitoring (Owner: Operations Team)\n\nWe request leadership approval to proceed with this implementation plan and allocation of the $450K budget by June 15th to ensure Q3 launch.\n\n## FAQ\nQ: How will this affect our current customer service team?\nA: No layoffs are planned. The chatbot will handle routine inquiries, allowing our agents to focus on complex issues requiring human judgment and empathy.\n\nQ: What is the expected customer adoption rate?\nA: Based on industry benchmarks and our customer behavior analysis, we expect 65% of customers to utilize the chatbot for initial inquiries within 3 months of launch.\n\n## Appendices\nAppendix A: Solution Comparison Analysis\nAppendix B: Detailed Cost Projections and ROI Analysis\nAppendix C: Customer Survey Data\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Lack of Specific Data\nIf the user lacks specific data to support their narrative:\n- The model SHOULD suggest types of data that would strengthen their argument\n- The model SHOULD help identify potential sources for this data\n- The model SHOULD suggest framing the narrative to acknowledge data limitations while still making a compelling case\n\n### Unclear Purpose or Recommendation\nIf the user is struggling to articulate a clear purpose or recommendation:\n- The model SHOULD ask targeted questions to help clarify their thinking\n- The model SHOULD suggest potential frameworks for structuring their recommendation\n- The model SHOULD provide examples of well-framed purpose statements or recommendations\n\n### Document Length Issues\nIf the document becomes excessively long:\n- The model SHOULD suggest moving detailed information to appendices\n- The model SHOULD help identify redundant content that can be removed\n- The model SHOULD suggest ways to make language more concise\n- The model SHOULD remind the user that Amazon values brevity and directness\n\n### Balancing Multiple Stakeholder Needs\nIf the user needs to address multiple stakeholder perspectives:\n- The model SHOULD suggest organizing the recommendation to address key concerns of each stakeholder group\n- The model SHOULD help identify common ground across stakeholder groups\n- The model SHOULD suggest using the FAQ section to address stakeholder-specific concerns\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":98,"oldLines":11,"newStart":98,"newLines":12,"lines":[" - The model MUST ask: \"What specific solution(s) are you proposing to address the problem/opportunity?\""," - The model MUST ask: \"What evidence supports the effectiveness of your recommended approach?\""," - The model MUST ask: \"Have you considered alternative approaches?

Every new engineer must successfully complete BT101 to gain proficiency in essential tools including Brazil (build system), CRUX (code review), CDK (infrastructure as code), Apollo (deployment), and Pipelines (CI/CD).\n\nThe current BT101 process, last significantly updated in **TK**, requires each developer to navigate an extensive setup process before they can begin learning. This includes completing detailed prerequisites, manually configuring development environments, and ensuring proper access to multiple internal systems. While the training content itself delivers valuable knowledge, the path to get there has become increasingly complex as Amazon's toolchain has evolved.\n\nCurrently, new developers spend their first **TK** days primarily on setup and configuration rather than learning core development practices. This approach made sense when Amazon's engineering organization was smaller and tools were simpler. However, with our current scale of **TK** new hires per quarter and the availability of modern development environment technologies like DevSpaces, we have an opportunity to dramatically improve this experience.\n\nThe Builder Tools organization has consistently heard feedback through channels like #sb-onboarding-help (averaging **TK** messages daily) that the setup process is the most frustrating part of the onboarding experience. This feedback, combined with the strategic importance of developer productivity, makes addressing these challenges a priority.\n\n## Problem\n\nThe current BT101 onboarding process creates significant friction that delays new developer productivity and generates substantial support overhead.\n\n### Quantifiable Time Loss\n\nNew developers face multiple time-consuming barriers before they can begin actual learning:\n\n- **Prerequisites completion:** TK hours of documentation review and manual setup\n- **Tool installation and configuration:** TK hours across TK different tools\n- **Burner account creation:** 15-30 minute wait time (when systems are responsive)\n- **Environment troubleshooting:** TK% of students spend an additional TK hours debugging issues\n- **Total setup time:** TK-TK hours before meaningful learning begins\n\nWith TK new SDEs annually, this represents approximately **TK total hours** of lost productivity—equivalent to **TK full-time engineers** spending their entire year just on setup.\n\n### Primary Failure Points\n\nAnalysis of TK support tickets and Slack messages reveals consistent pain points:\n\n1. **Incomplete Prerequisites** - The #1 cause of student issues, accounting for TK% of support requests. Students frequently miss critical steps in the lengthy prerequisite documentation, leading to cascading failures during the workshop.\n\n2. **Environment Inconsistency** - Each developer's unique laptop configuration, operating system, and existing tool installations create TK different potential failure modes. What works on one developer's machine may fail mysteriously on another's.\n\n3. **Manual Process Errors** - Command-line typos, incorrect capitalization (e.g., \"bt101_username\" vs \"BT101_Username\"), and copy-paste errors cause TK% of initial setup failures.\n\n4. **Sequential Dependencies** - The current process requires strict ordering: step B cannot begin until step A completes successfully. A failure at any point blocks all subsequent progress.\n\n### Support Burden\n\nThe human cost extends beyond the new developers themselves:\n\n- **#sb-onboarding-help Slack channel:** Receives TK messages daily, with peak volumes of TK during high-hiring periods\n- **Volunteer trainers:** Spend an estimated TK hours weekly answering repetitive questions\n- **Team productivity:** New hire's teammates lose TK hours helping troubleshoot setup issues\n- **Most common questions (TK% of total):**\n  - \"Why is my build failing with 'permission denied'?\"\n  - \"My burner account creation is stuck\"\n  - \"Command not found: brazil\"\n  - \"Cannot find package in version set\"\n\n### Business Impact\n\nBeyond individual frustration, these inefficiencies have measurable business consequences:\n\n- **Delayed Feature Delivery:** At $TK per developer hour, the TK hours of setup time costs approximately $TK annually\n- **Reduced Initial Productivity:** Studies show that frustrating onboarding experiences reduce new hire productivity by TK% for their first TK days\n- **Increased Attrition Risk:** TK% of new SDEs cite poor onboarding experience as a factor in early attrition decisions\n- **Opportunity Cost:** Every hour spent on setup is an hour not spent learning Amazon's architectural patterns, security best practices, or team-specific systems\n\n### The Opportunity\n\nDevSpaces, Amazon's rapidly launching pre-configured developer environment solution, offers a proven path forward. DevSpaces provides builders with a development setup that \"just works\" in **under 30 seconds**—a dramatic improvement from the current multi-hour BT101 setup process. With DevSpaces' blueprint-based approach, we can create standardized BT101 environments that include all necessary tools, dependencies, and configurations, completely eliminating manual setup errors and environment inconsistencies.\n\nThe DevSpaces team has already identified similar use cases across Amazon, noting scenarios where developers lose 15+ minutes waiting for environments during on-call incidents, code reviews, and cross-team investigations. By applying DevSpaces to BT101, we can transform the current multi-hour setup marathon into a sub-minute automated process, allowing new developers to focus on what matters: learning to build great software at Amazon scale.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe propose a two-pronged approach to eliminate BT101 setup friction:\n\n### 1. Provide DevSpaces Instead of Manual Environment Setup\n\nReplace the current manual environment configuration process with pre-configured DevSpaces that builders can launch instantly:\n\n**DevSpace Blueprint for BT101:**\n- Pre-installed Brazil CLI tools and configurations\n- BuilderHub Create with proper authentication\n- CRUX setup for code reviews\n- AWS CLI and CDK frameworks\n- All testing tools and dependencies\n- Eliminates the entire prerequisites documentation\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Launch time: Under 30 seconds vs current TK hours\n- Zero configuration errors\n- Consistent environments for all participants\n- No \"works on my machine\" issues\n\n### 2. Pre-create BT101 Applications During Onboarding\n\nWork separately to automatically provision BT101 resources when builders are hired:\n\n**Automated Provisioning at Hire Time:**\n- Create BT101 application in new hire's personal bindle during onboarding\n- Pre-provision burner AWS account from a managed pool\n- Bootstrap account with necessary permissions and resources\n- Have everything ready before the builder starts BT101\n\n### Expected Outcomes\n\n- **Setup time reduction:** From TK hours to under 1 minute\n- **Support ticket reduction:** Estimated TK% decrease in #sb-onboarding-help volume\n- **First-day productivity:** New SDEs writing code within their first hour\n- **Consistency guarantee:** 100% identical environments eliminating \"works on my machine\" issues\n- **Cost savings:** $TK annually from reduced setup time and support overhead\n\n## Open Questions\n\nBased on the action items from our initial analysis, several key questions need to be addressed to move forward with this proposal:\n\n### DevSpaces Integration\n\n1. **DevSpaces Readiness for Training:** \n   - Can DevSpaces handle the scale of simultaneous BT101 sessions during peak hiring periods?\n   - What is the timeline for DevSpaces GA release and stability guarantees?\n   - How do we handle DevSpaces outages during critical training sessions?\n\n2. **Blueprint Management:**\n   - Who will own and maintain the BT101 DevSpace blueprint?\n   - How frequently should the blueprint be updated as tools evolve?\n   - Can we version blueprints to support different BT101 variations?\n\n### Automation and Provisioning\n\n3. **Embark Hook Implementation:**\n   - What technical barriers exist for integrating with the new hire Embark workflow?\n   - How do we handle edge cases where automatic provisioning fails?\n   - What fallback mechanisms should be in place?\n\n4. **Personal Bindle Auto-Population:**\n   - How do we automatically grant source code access to new hire personal bindles?\n   - What security reviews are required for automated permission grants?\n   - How do we handle contractors or temporary employees with different access levels?\n\n### Burner Account Management\n\n5. **Automated Burner Account Creation:**\n   - Can we create a pool of pre-provisioned burner accounts for instant assignment?\n   - How do we handle account cleanup after training completion?\n   - What are the cost implications of maintaining a burner account pool?\n\n6. **Account Bootstrap Automation:**\n   - Can the manual bootstrap process be fully automated?\n   - How do we handle AWS service limits during bulk account creation?\n   - What monitoring is needed to ensure account health?\n\n### Organizational Considerations\n\n7. **Team Ownership:**\n   - Should this be owned by the Builder Tools team, Training team, or a joint effort?\n   - How do we coordinate between DevSpaces, BuilderHub, and BT101 teams?\n   - Who provides ongoing support for the quickstart infrastructure?\n\n8. **Migration Strategy:**\n   - How do we transition from the current BT101 process to the DevSpaces-based approach?\n   - Should we run both systems in parallel during transition?\n   - How do we update all existing documentation and training materials?\n\n### Technical Constraints\n\n9. **Generic Burner Applications:**\n   - Can we create generic burner applications that work for all new hires?\n   - How do we handle team-specific customizations or requirements?\n   - What about fleet owner permissions and resource allocation?\n\n10. **Scalability and Performance:**\n    - What is the maximum number of concurrent DevSpaces we can support?\n    - How do we ensure consistent performance during high-volume periods?\n    - What infrastructure investments are needed to support this scale?\n\n### Success Metrics\n\n11. **Measurement and Validation:**\n    - How do we measure success beyond setup time reduction?\n    - What metrics should we track for continuous improvement?\n    - How do we gather feedback from new hires using the new system?\n\nThese questions need to be addressed through collaboration with the DevSpaces team, BuilderHub, Embark owners, and AWS account management teams to ensure a successful implementation of the BT101 Quickstart initiative.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":34,"oldLines":7,"newStart":34,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," ## Background"," ","-BT101 (Builder Tools 101) is Amazon's foundational workshop that teaches new software development engineers how to build their first service using Amazon's internal tools and best practices.

With approximately **TK** new SDEs joining Amazon annually, this training serves as the critical gateway to developer productivity. Every new engineer must successfully complete BT101 to gain proficiency in essential tools including Brazil (build system), CRUX (code review), CDK (infrastructure as code), and Pipelines (CI/CD).\n\nThe current BT101 process, last significantly updated in **TK**, requires each developer to navigate an extensive setup process before they can begin learning. This includes completing detailed prerequisites, manually configuring development environments, and ensuring proper access to multiple internal systems. While the training content itself delivers valuable knowledge, the path to get there has become increasingly complex as Amazon's toolchain has evolved.\n\nCurrently, new developers spend their first **TK** days primarily on setup and configuration rather than learning core development practices. This approach made sense when Amazon's engineering organization was smaller and tools were simpler. However, with our current scale of **TK** new hires per quarter and the availability of modern development environment technologies like DevSpaces, we have an opportunity to dramatically improve this experience.\n\nThe Builder Tools organization has consistently heard feedback through channels like #sb-onboarding-help (averaging **TK** messages daily) that the setup process is the most frustrating part of the onboarding experience. This feedback, combined with the strategic importance of developer productivity, makes addressing these challenges a priority.\n\n## Problem\n\nThe current BT101 onboarding process creates significant friction that delays new developer productivity and generates substantial support overhead.\n\n### Quantifiable Time Loss\n\nNew developers face multiple time-consuming barriers before they can begin actual learning:\n\n- **Prerequisites completion:** TK hours of documentation review and manual setup\n- **Tool installation and configuration:** TK hours across TK different tools\n- **Burner account creation:** 15-30 minute wait time (when systems are responsive)\n- **Environment troubleshooting:** TK% of students spend an additional TK hours debugging issues\n- **Total setup time:** TK-TK hours before meaningful learning begins\n\nWith TK new SDEs annually, this represents approximately **TK total hours** of lost productivity—equivalent to **TK full-time engineers** spending their entire year just on setup.\n\n### Primary Failure Points\n\nAnalysis of TK support tickets and Slack messages reveals consistent pain points:\n\n1. **Incomplete Prerequisites** - The #1 cause of student issues, accounting for TK% of support requests.

DevSpaces provides builders with a development setup that \"just works\" in **under 30 seconds**—a dramatic improvement from the current multi-hour BT101 setup process. With DevSpaces' blueprint-based approach, we can create standardized BT101 environments that include all necessary tools, dependencies, and configurations, completely eliminating manual setup errors and environment inconsistencies.\n\nThe DevSpaces team has already identified similar use cases across Amazon, noting scenarios where developers lose 15+ minutes waiting for environments during on-call incidents, code reviews, and cross-team investigations. By applying DevSpaces to BT101, we can transform the current multi-hour setup marathon into a sub-minute automated process, allowing new developers to focus on what matters: learning to build great software at Amazon scale.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe propose a two-pronged approach to eliminate BT101 setup friction:\n\n### 1. Provide DevSpaces Instead of Manual Environment Setup\n\nReplace the current manual environment configuration process with pre-configured DevSpaces that builders can launch instantly:\n\n**DevSpace Blueprint for BT101:**\n- Pre-installed Brazil CLI tools and configurations\n- BuilderHub Create with proper authentication\n- CRUX setup for code reviews\n- AWS CLI and CDK frameworks\n- All testing tools and dependencies\n- Eliminates the entire prerequisites documentation\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Launch time: Under 30 seconds vs current TK hours\n- Zero configuration errors\n- Consistent environments for all participants\n- No \"works on my machine\" issues\n\n### 2. Pre-create BT101 Applications During Onboarding\n\nWork separately to automatically provision BT101 resources when builders are hired:\n\n**Automated Provisioning at Hire Time:**\n- Create BT101 application in new hire's personal bindle during onboarding\n- Pre-provision burner AWS account from a managed pool\n- Bootstrap account with necessary permissions and resources\n- Have everything ready before the builder starts BT101\n\n### Expected Outcomes\n\n- **Setup time reduction:** From TK hours to under 1 minute\n- **Support ticket reduction:** Estimated TK% decrease in #sb-onboarding-help volume\n- **First-day productivity:** New SDEs writing code within their first hour\n- **Consistency guarantee:** 100% identical environments eliminating \"works on my machine\" issues\n- **Cost savings:** $TK annually from reduced setup time and support overhead\n\n## Open Questions\n\nBased on the action items from our initial analysis, several key questions need to be addressed to move forward with this proposal:\n\n### DevSpaces Integration\n\n1. **DevSpaces Readiness for Training:** \n   - Can DevSpaces handle the scale of simultaneous BT101 sessions during peak hiring periods?\n   - What is the timeline for DevSpaces GA release and stability guarantees?\n   - How do we handle DevSpaces outages during critical training sessions?\n\n2. **Blueprint Management:**\n   - Who will own and maintain the BT101 DevSpace blueprint?\n   - How frequently should the blueprint be updated as tools evolve?\n   - Can we version blueprints to support different BT101 variations?\n\n### Automation and Provisioning\n\n3. **Embark Hook Implementation:**\n   - What technical barriers exist for integrating with the new hire Embark workflow?\n   - How do we handle edge cases where automatic provisioning fails?\n   - What fallback mechanisms should be in place?\n\n4. **Personal Bindle Auto-Population:**\n   - How do we automatically grant source code access to new hire personal bindles?\n   - What security reviews are required for automated permission grants?\n   - How do we handle contractors or temporary employees with different access levels?\n\n### Burner Account Management\n\n5. **Automated Burner Account Creation:**\n   - Can we create a pool of pre-provisioned burner accounts for instant assignment?\n   - How do we handle account cleanup after training completion?\n   - What are the cost implications of maintaining a burner account pool?\n\n6. **Account Bootstrap Automation:**\n   - Can the manual bootstrap process be fully automated?\n   - How do we handle AWS service limits during bulk account creation?\n   - What monitoring is needed to ensure account health?\n\n### Organizational Considerations\n\n7. **Team Ownership:**\n   - Should this be owned by the Builder Tools team, Training team, or a joint effort?\n   - How do we coordinate between DevSpaces, BuilderHub, and BT101 teams?\n   - Who provides ongoing support for the quickstart infrastructure?\n\n8. **Migration Strategy:**\n   - How do we transition from the current BT101 process to the DevSpaces-based approach?\n   - Should we run both systems in parallel during transition?\n   - How do we update all existing documentation and training materials?\n\n### Technical Constraints\n\n9. **Generic Burner Applications:**\n   - Can we create generic burner applications that work for all new hires?\n   - How do we handle team-specific customizations or requirements?\n   - What about fleet owner permissions and resource allocation?\n\n10. **Scalability and Performance:**\n    - What is the maximum number of concurrent DevSpaces we can support?\n    - How do we ensure consistent performance during high-volume periods?\n    - What infrastructure investments are needed to support this scale?\n\n### Success Metrics\n\n11. **Measurement and Validation:**\n    - How do we measure success beyond setup time reduction?\n    - What metrics should we track for continuous improvement?\n    - How do we gather feedback from new hires using the new system?\n\nThese questions need to be addressed through collaboration with the DevSpaces team, BuilderHub, Embark owners, and AWS account management teams to ensure a successful implementation of the BT101 Quickstart initiative.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":44,"oldLines":54,"newStart":44,"newLines":12,"lines":[" "," ## Problem"," ","-The current BT101 onboarding process creates significant friction that delays new developer productivity and generates substantial support overhead.","+The current BT101 onboarding process creates a compounding crisis of lost productivity that impacts thousands of new developers annually.

With approximately **TK** new SDEs joining Amazon annually, this training serves as the critical gateway to developer productivity. Every new engineer must successfully complete BT101 to gain proficiency in essential tools including Brazil (build system), CRUX (code review), CDK (infrastructure as code), and Pipelines (CI/CD).\n\nThe current BT101 process, last significantly updated in **TK**, requires each developer to navigate an extensive setup process before they can begin learning. This includes completing detailed prerequisites, manually configuring development environments, and ensuring proper access to multiple internal systems. While the training content itself delivers valuable knowledge, the path to get there has become increasingly complex as Amazon's toolchain has evolved.\n\nCurrently, new developers spend their first **TK** days primarily on setup and configuration rather than learning core development practices. This approach made sense when Amazon's engineering organization was smaller and tools were simpler. However, with our current scale of **TK** new hires per quarter and the availability of modern development environment technologies like DevSpaces, we have an opportunity to dramatically improve this experience.\n\nThe Builder Tools organization has consistently heard feedback through channels like #sb-onboarding-help (averaging **TK** messages daily) that the setup process is the most frustrating part of the onboarding experience. This feedback, combined with the strategic importance of developer productivity, makes addressing these challenges a priority.\n\n## Problem\n\nThe current BT101 onboarding process creates a compounding crisis of lost productivity that impacts thousands of new developers annually. New developers face TK-TK hours of setup time before they can begin meaningful learning, navigating through prerequisites completion (TK hours), tool installation across TK different systems (TK hours), burner account creation (15-30 minutes when systems work), and environment troubleshooting that affects TK% of students for an additional TK hours.

This represents not just a training problem, but a strategic disadvantage in our ability to quickly onboard and scale our engineering workforce.\n\n### The Opportunity\n\nDevSpaces, Amazon's rapidly launching pre-configured developer environment solution, offers a proven path forward. DevSpaces provides builders with a development setup that \"just works\" in **under 30 seconds**—a dramatic improvement from the current multi-hour BT101 setup process. With DevSpaces' blueprint-based approach, we can create standardized BT101 environments that include all necessary tools, dependencies, and configurations, completely eliminating manual setup errors and environment inconsistencies.\n\nThe DevSpaces team has already identified similar use cases across Amazon, noting scenarios where developers lose 15+ minutes waiting for environments during on-call incidents, code reviews, and cross-team investigations. By applying DevSpaces to BT101, we can transform the current multi-hour setup marathon into a sub-minute automated process, allowing new developers to focus on what matters: learning to build great software at Amazon scale.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe propose a two-pronged approach to eliminate BT101 setup friction:\n\n### 1. Provide DevSpaces Instead of Manual Environment Setup\n\nReplace the current manual environment configuration process with pre-configured DevSpaces that builders can launch instantly:\n\n**DevSpace Blueprint for BT101:**\n- Pre-installed Brazil CLI tools and configurations\n- BuilderHub Create with proper authentication\n- CRUX setup for code reviews\n- AWS CLI and CDK frameworks\n- All testing tools and dependencies\n- Eliminates the entire prerequisites documentation\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Launch time: Under 30 seconds vs current TK hours\n- Zero configuration errors\n- Consistent environments for all participants\n- No \"works on my machine\" issues\n\n### 2. Pre-create BT101 Applications During Onboarding\n\nWork separately to automatically provision BT101 resources when builders are hired:\n\n**Automated Provisioning at Hire Time:**\n- Create BT101 application in new hire's personal bindle during onboarding\n- Pre-provision burner AWS account from a managed pool\n- Bootstrap account with necessary permissions and resources\n- Have everything ready before the builder starts BT101\n\n### Expected Outcomes\n\n- **Setup time reduction:** From TK hours to under 1 minute\n- **Support ticket reduction:** Estimated TK% decrease in #sb-onboarding-help volume\n- **First-day productivity:** New SDEs writing code within their first hour\n- **Consistency guarantee:** 100% identical environments eliminating \"works on my machine\" issues\n- **Cost savings:** $TK annually from reduced setup time and support overhead\n\n## Open Questions\n\nBased on the action items from our initial analysis, several key questions need to be addressed to move forward with this proposal:\n\n### DevSpaces Integration\n\n1. **DevSpaces Readiness for Training:** \n   - Can DevSpaces handle the scale of simultaneous BT101 sessions during peak hiring periods?\n   - What is the timeline for DevSpaces GA release and stability guarantees?\n   - How do we handle DevSpaces outages during critical training sessions?\n\n2. **Blueprint Management:**\n   - Who will own and maintain the BT101 DevSpace blueprint?\n   - How frequently should the blueprint be updated as tools evolve?\n   - Can we version blueprints to support different BT101 variations?\n\n### Automation and Provisioning\n\n3. **Embark Hook Implementation:**\n   - What technical barriers exist for integrating with the new hire Embark workflow?\n   - How do we handle edge cases where automatic provisioning fails?\n   - What fallback mechanisms should be in place?\n\n4. **Personal Bindle Auto-Population:**\n   - How do we automatically grant source code access to new hire personal bindles?\n   - What security reviews are required for automated permission grants?\n   - How do we handle contractors or temporary employees with different access levels?\n\n### Burner Account Management\n\n5. **Automated Burner Account Creation:**\n   - Can we create a pool of pre-provisioned burner accounts for instant assignment?\n   - How do we handle account cleanup after training completion?\n   - What are the cost implications of maintaining a burner account pool?\n\n6. **Account Bootstrap Automation:**\n   - Can the manual bootstrap process be fully automated?\n   - How do we handle AWS service limits during bulk account creation?\n   - What monitoring is needed to ensure account health?\n\n### Organizational Considerations\n\n7. **Team Ownership:**\n   - Should this be owned by the Builder Tools team, Training team, or a joint effort?\n   - How do we coordinate between DevSpaces, BuilderHub, and BT101 teams?\n   - Who provides ongoing support for the quickstart infrastructure?\n\n8. **Migration Strategy:**\n   - How do we transition from the current BT101 process to the DevSpaces-based approach?\n   - Should we run both systems in parallel during transition?\n   - How do we update all existing documentation and training materials?\n\n### Technical Constraints\n\n9. **Generic Burner Applications:**\n   - Can we create generic burner applications that work for all new hires?\n   - How do we handle team-specific customizations or requirements?\n   - What about fleet owner permissions and resource allocation?\n\n10. **Scalability and Performance:**\n    - What is the maximum number of concurrent DevSpaces we can support?\n    - How do we ensure consistent performance during high-volume periods?\n    - What infrastructure investments are needed to support this scale?\n\n### Success Metrics\n\n11. **Measurement and Validation:**\n    - How do we measure success beyond setup time reduction?\n    - What metrics should we track for continuous improvement?\n    - How do we gather feedback from new hires using the new system?\n\nThese questions need to be addressed through collaboration with the DevSpaces team, BuilderHub, Embark owners, and AWS account management teams to ensure a successful implementation of the BT101 Quickstart initiative.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":44,"oldLines":11,"newStart":44,"newLines":11,"lines":[" "," ## Problem"," ","-The current BT101 onboarding process creates a compounding crisis of lost productivity that impacts thousands of new developers annually.

With approximately **TK** new SDEs joining Amazon annually, this training serves as the critical gateway to developer productivity. Every new engineer must successfully complete BT101 to gain proficiency in essential tools including Brazil (build system), CRUX (code review), CDK (infrastructure as code), and Pipelines (CI/CD).\n\nThe current BT101 process, last significantly updated in **TK**, requires each developer to navigate an extensive setup process before they can begin learning. This includes completing detailed prerequisites, manually configuring development environments, and ensuring proper access to multiple internal systems. While the training content itself delivers valuable knowledge, the path to get there has become increasingly complex as Amazon's toolchain has evolved.\n\nCurrently, new developers spend their first **TK** days primarily on setup and configuration rather than learning core development practices. This approach made sense when Amazon's engineering organization was smaller and tools were simpler. However, with our current scale of **TK** new hires per quarter and the availability of modern development environment technologies like DevSpaces, we have an opportunity to dramatically improve this experience.\n\nThe Builder Tools organization has consistently heard feedback through channels like #sb-onboarding-help (averaging **TK** messages daily) that the setup process is the most frustrating part of the onboarding experience. This feedback, combined with the strategic importance of developer productivity, makes addressing these challenges a priority.\n\n## Problem\n\nThe current BT101 onboarding process requires significant manual setup that delays when new developers can begin productive learning. New developers typically spend TK-TK hours on setup tasks before starting the actual training, including prerequisites completion (TK hours), tool installation (TK hours), burner account creation (15-30 minutes), and environment troubleshooting that affects TK% of students for an additional TK hours. With TK new SDEs joining annually, this represents approximately **TK total hours** spent on setup rather than learning—equivalent to **TK full-time engineers** worth of productivity. At $TK per developer hour, this represents an opportunity to recapture approximately $TK annually through improved efficiency.\n\nAnalysis of TK support tickets and Slack messages reveals consistent patterns in setup challenges. Incomplete prerequisites account for TK% of support requests as students occasionally miss steps in the documentation. Environment differences across laptop configurations and operating systems create variability in setup experiences. Manual command entry sometimes leads to typos or capitalization errors (e.g., \"bt101_username\" vs \"BT101_Username\") that cause TK% of initial setup issues.

This results in regular support requests, with the #sb-onboarding-help Slack channel receiving TK messages daily, volunteer trainers dedicating TK hours weekly to common questions, and teammates spending TK hours assisting with setup.\n\nWhile the current process ultimately gets developers onboarded successfully, there's an opportunity to improve the experience and efficiency. Reducing setup friction could improve new hire productivity during their first TK days and ensure developers spend more time learning Amazon's architectural patterns and security best practices rather than troubleshooting environment issues. With modern tools like DevSpaces now available, we can streamline this process to better support our growing engineering organization.\n\n### The Opportunity\n\nDevSpaces, Amazon's rapidly launching pre-configured developer environment solution, offers a proven path forward. DevSpaces provides builders with a development setup that \"just works\" in **under 30 seconds**—a dramatic improvement from the current multi-hour BT101 setup process. With DevSpaces' blueprint-based approach, we can create standardized BT101 environments that include all necessary tools, dependencies, and configurations, completely eliminating manual setup errors and environment inconsistencies.\n\nThe DevSpaces team has already identified similar use cases across Amazon, noting scenarios where developers lose 15+ minutes waiting for environments during on-call incidents, code reviews, and cross-team investigations. By applying DevSpaces to BT101, we can transform the current multi-hour setup marathon into a sub-minute automated process, allowing new developers to focus on what matters: learning to build great software at Amazon scale.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe propose a two-pronged approach to eliminate BT101 setup friction:\n\n### 1. Provide DevSpaces Instead of Manual Environment Setup\n\nReplace the current manual environment configuration process with pre-configured DevSpaces that builders can launch instantly:\n\n**DevSpace Blueprint for BT101:**\n- Pre-installed Brazil CLI tools and configurations\n- BuilderHub Create with proper authentication\n- CRUX setup for code reviews\n- AWS CLI and CDK frameworks\n- All testing tools and dependencies\n- Eliminates the entire prerequisites documentation\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Launch time: Under 30 seconds vs current TK hours\n- Zero configuration errors\n- Consistent environments for all participants\n- No \"works on my machine\" issues\n\n### 2. Pre-create BT101 Applications During Onboarding\n\nWork separately to automatically provision BT101 resources when builders are hired:\n\n**Automated Provisioning at Hire Time:**\n- Create BT101 application in new hire's personal bindle during onboarding\n- Pre-provision burner AWS account from a managed pool\n- Bootstrap account with necessary permissions and resources\n- Have everything ready before the builder starts BT101\n\n### Expected Outcomes\n\n- **Setup time reduction:** From TK hours to under 1 minute\n- **Support ticket reduction:** Estimated TK% decrease in #sb-onboarding-help volume\n- **First-day productivity:** New SDEs writing code within their first hour\n- **Consistency guarantee:** 100% identical environments eliminating \"works on my machine\" issues\n- **Cost savings:** $TK annually from reduced setup time and support overhead\n\n## Open Questions\n\nBased on the action items from our initial analysis, several key questions need to be addressed to move forward with this proposal:\n\n### DevSpaces Integration\n\n1. **DevSpaces Readiness for Training:** \n   - Can DevSpaces handle the scale of simultaneous BT101 sessions during peak hiring periods?\n   - What is the timeline for DevSpaces GA release and stability guarantees?\n   - How do we handle DevSpaces outages during critical training sessions?\n\n2. **Blueprint Management:**\n   - Who will own and maintain the BT101 DevSpace blueprint?\n   - How frequently should the blueprint be updated as tools evolve?\n   - Can we version blueprints to support different BT101 variations?\n\n### Automation and Provisioning\n\n3. **Embark Hook Implementation:**\n   - What technical barriers exist for integrating with the new hire Embark workflow?\n   - How do we handle edge cases where automatic provisioning fails?\n   - What fallback mechanisms should be in place?\n\n4. **Personal Bindle Auto-Population:**\n   - How do we automatically grant source code access to new hire personal bindles?\n   - What security reviews are required for automated permission grants?\n   - How do we handle contractors or temporary employees with different access levels?\n\n### Burner Account Management\n\n5. **Automated Burner Account Creation:**\n   - Can we create a pool of pre-provisioned burner accounts for instant assignment?\n   - How do we handle account cleanup after training completion?\n   - What are the cost implications of maintaining a burner account pool?\n\n6. **Account Bootstrap Automation:**\n   - Can the manual bootstrap process be fully automated?\n   - How do we handle AWS service limits during bulk account creation?\n   - What monitoring is needed to ensure account health?\n\n### Organizational Considerations\n\n7. **Team Ownership:**\n   - Should this be owned by the Builder Tools team, Training team, or a joint effort?\n   - How do we coordinate between DevSpaces, BuilderHub, and BT101 teams?\n   - Who provides ongoing support for the quickstart infrastructure?\n\n8. **Migration Strategy:**\n   - How do we transition from the current BT101 process to the DevSpaces-based approach?\n   - Should we run both systems in parallel during transition?\n   - How do we update all existing documentation and training materials?\n\n### Technical Constraints\n\n9. **Generic Burner Applications:**\n   - Can we create generic burner applications that work for all new hires?\n   - How do we handle team-specific customizations or requirements?\n   - What about fleet owner permissions and resource allocation?\n\n10. **Scalability and Performance:**\n    - What is the maximum number of concurrent DevSpaces we can support?\n    - How do we ensure consistent performance during high-volume periods?\n    - What infrastructure investments are needed to support this scale?\n\n### Success Metrics\n\n11. **Measurement and Validation:**\n    - How do we measure success beyond setup time reduction?\n    - What metrics should we track for continuous improvement?\n    - How do we gather feedback from new hires using the new system?\n\nThese questions need to be addressed through collaboration with the DevSpaces team, BuilderHub, Embark owners, and AWS account management teams to ensure a successful implementation of the BT101 Quickstart initiative.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":44,"oldLines":11,"newStart":44,"newLines":11,"lines":[" "," ## Problem"," ","-The current BT101 onboarding process requires significant manual setup that delays when new developers can begin productive learning.

With approximately **TK** new SDEs joining Amazon annually, this training serves as the critical gateway to developer productivity. Every new engineer must successfully complete BT101 to gain proficiency in essential tools including Brazil (build system), CRUX (code review), CDK (infrastructure as code), and Pipelines (CI/CD).\n\nThe current BT101 process, last significantly updated in **TK**, requires each developer to navigate an extensive setup process before they can begin learning. This includes completing detailed prerequisites, manually configuring development environments, and ensuring proper access to multiple internal systems. While the training content itself delivers valuable knowledge, the path to get there has become increasingly complex as Amazon's toolchain has evolved.\n\nCurrently, new developers spend their first **TK** days primarily on setup and configuration rather than learning core development practices. This approach made sense when Amazon's engineering organization was smaller and tools were simpler. However, with our current scale of **TK** new hires per quarter and the availability of modern development environment technologies like DevSpaces, we have an opportunity to dramatically improve this experience.\n\nThe Builder Tools organization has consistently heard feedback through channels like #sb-onboarding-help (averaging **TK** messages daily) that the setup process is the most frustrating part of the onboarding experience. This feedback, combined with the strategic importance of developer productivity, makes addressing these challenges a priority.\n\n## Problem\n\nThe current BT101 onboarding process requires significant manual setup that delays when new developers can begin productive learning. New developers typically spend **TK-TK** hours on setup tasks before starting the actual training, including prerequisites completion (**TK** hours), tool installation (**TK** hours), burner account creation (15-30 minutes), and environment troubleshooting that affects **TK%** of students for an additional **TK** hours. With **TK** new SDEs joining annually, this represents approximately **TK total hours** spent on setup rather than learning—equivalent to **TK full-time engineers** worth of productivity. At $**TK** per developer hour, this represents an opportunity to recapture approximately $**TK** annually through improved efficiency.\n\nAnalysis of **TK** support tickets and Slack messages reveals consistent patterns in setup challenges. Incomplete prerequisites account for **TK%** of support requests as students occasionally miss steps in the documentation. Environment differences across laptop configurations and operating systems create variability in setup experiences. Manual command entry sometimes leads to typos or capitalization errors (e.g., \"bt101_username\" vs \"BT101_Username\") that cause **TK%** of initial setup issues. The sequential nature of the setup means issues at any step can delay progress. This results in regular support requests, with the #sb-onboarding-help Slack channel receiving **TK** messages daily, volunteer trainers dedicating **TK** hours weekly to common questions, and teammates spending **TK** hours assisting with setup.\n\nWhile the current process ultimately gets developers onboarded successfully, there's an opportunity to improve the experience and efficiency. Reducing setup friction could improve new hire productivity during their first **TK** days and ensure developers spend more time learning Amazon's architectural patterns and security best practices rather than troubleshooting environment issues. With modern tools like DevSpaces now available, we can streamline this process to better support our growing engineering organization.\n\n### The Opportunity\n\nDevSpaces, Amazon's rapidly launching pre-configured developer environment solution, offers a proven path forward. DevSpaces provides builders with a development setup that \"just works\" in **under 30 seconds**—a dramatic improvement from the current multi-hour BT101 setup process. With DevSpaces' blueprint-based approach, we can create standardized BT101 environments that include all necessary tools, dependencies, and configurations, completely eliminating manual setup errors and environment inconsistencies.\n\nThe DevSpaces team has already identified similar use cases across Amazon, noting scenarios where developers lose 15+ minutes waiting for environments during on-call incidents, code reviews, and cross-team investigations. By applying DevSpaces to BT101, we can transform the current multi-hour setup marathon into a sub-minute automated process, allowing new developers to focus on what matters: learning to build great software at Amazon scale.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe propose a two-pronged approach to eliminate BT101 setup friction:\n\n### 1. Provide DevSpaces Instead of Manual Environment Setup\n\nReplace the current manual environment configuration process with pre-configured DevSpaces that builders can launch instantly:\n\n**DevSpace Blueprint for BT101:**\n- Pre-installed Brazil CLI tools and configurations\n- BuilderHub Create with proper authentication\n- CRUX setup for code reviews\n- AWS CLI and CDK frameworks\n- All testing tools and dependencies\n- Eliminates the entire prerequisites documentation\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Launch time: Under 30 seconds vs current TK hours\n- Zero configuration errors\n- Consistent environments for all participants\n- No \"works on my machine\" issues\n\n### 2. Pre-create BT101 Applications During Onboarding\n\nWork separately to automatically provision BT101 resources when builders are hired:\n\n**Automated Provisioning at Hire Time:**\n- Create BT101 application in new hire's personal bindle during onboarding\n- Pre-provision burner AWS account from a managed pool\n- Bootstrap account with necessary permissions and resources\n- Have everything ready before the builder starts BT101\n\n### Expected Outcomes\n\n- **Setup time reduction:** From TK hours to under 1 minute\n- **Support ticket reduction:** Estimated TK% decrease in #sb-onboarding-help volume\n- **First-day productivity:** New SDEs writing code within their first hour\n- **Consistency guarantee:** 100% identical environments eliminating \"works on my machine\" issues\n- **Cost savings:** $TK annually from reduced setup time and support overhead\n\n## Open Questions\n\nBased on the action items from our initial analysis, several key questions need to be addressed to move forward with this proposal:\n\n### DevSpaces Integration\n\n1. **DevSpaces Readiness for Training:** \n   - Can DevSpaces handle the scale of simultaneous BT101 sessions during peak hiring periods?\n   - What is the timeline for DevSpaces GA release and stability guarantees?\n   - How do we handle DevSpaces outages during critical training sessions?\n\n2. **Blueprint Management:**\n   - Who will own and maintain the BT101 DevSpace blueprint?\n   - How frequently should the blueprint be updated as tools evolve?\n   - Can we version blueprints to support different BT101 variations?\n\n### Automation and Provisioning\n\n3. **Embark Hook Implementation:**\n   - What technical barriers exist for integrating with the new hire Embark workflow?\n   - How do we handle edge cases where automatic provisioning fails?\n   - What fallback mechanisms should be in place?\n\n4. **Personal Bindle Auto-Population:**\n   - How do we automatically grant source code access to new hire personal bindles?\n   - What security reviews are required for automated permission grants?\n   - How do we handle contractors or temporary employees with different access levels?\n\n### Burner Account Management\n\n5. **Automated Burner Account Creation:**\n   - Can we create a pool of pre-provisioned burner accounts for instant assignment?\n   - How do we handle account cleanup after training completion?\n   - What are the cost implications of maintaining a burner account pool?\n\n6. **Account Bootstrap Automation:**\n   - Can the manual bootstrap process be fully automated?\n   - How do we handle AWS service limits during bulk account creation?\n   - What monitoring is needed to ensure account health?\n\n### Organizational Considerations\n\n7. **Team Ownership:**\n   - Should this be owned by the Builder Tools team, Training team, or a joint effort?\n   - How do we coordinate between DevSpaces, BuilderHub, and BT101 teams?\n   - Who provides ongoing support for the quickstart infrastructure?\n\n8. **Migration Strategy:**\n   - How do we transition from the current BT101 process to the DevSpaces-based approach?\n   - Should we run both systems in parallel during transition?\n   - How do we update all existing documentation and training materials?\n\n### Technical Constraints\n\n9. **Generic Burner Applications:**\n   - Can we create generic burner applications that work for all new hires?\n   - How do we handle team-specific customizations or requirements?\n   - What about fleet owner permissions and resource allocation?\n\n10. **Scalability and Performance:**\n    - What is the maximum number of concurrent DevSpaces we can support?\n    - How do we ensure consistent performance during high-volume periods?\n    - What infrastructure investments are needed to support this scale?\n\n### Success Metrics\n\n11. **Measurement and Validation:**\n    - How do we measure success beyond setup time reduction?\n    - What metrics should we track for continuous improvement?\n    - How do we gather feedback from new hires using the new system?\n\nThese questions need to be addressed through collaboration with the DevSpaces team, BuilderHub, Embark owners, and AWS account management teams to ensure a successful implementation of the BT101 Quickstart initiative.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":73,"oldLines":7,"newStart":73,"newLines":7,"lines":[" - Eliminates the entire prerequisites documentation"," "," **Benefits:**","-- Launch time: Under 30 seconds vs current TK hours","+- Launch time: Under 30 seconds vs current **TK** hours"," - Zero configuration errors"," - Consistent environments for all participants"," - No \"works on my machine\" issues"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

Pre-create BT101 Applications During Onboarding\n\nWork separately to automatically provision BT101 resources when builders are hired:\n\n**Automated Provisioning at Hire Time:**\n- Create BT101 application in new hire's personal bindle during onboarding\n- Pre-provision burner AWS account from a managed pool\n- Bootstrap account with necessary permissions and resources\n- Have everything ready before the builder starts BT101\n\n### Expected Outcomes\n\n- **Setup time reduction:** From TK hours to under 1 minute\n- **Support ticket reduction:** Estimated TK% decrease in #sb-onboarding-help volume\n- **First-day productivity:** New SDEs writing code within their first hour\n- **Consistency guarantee:** 100% identical environments eliminating \"works on my machine\" issues\n- **Cost savings:** $TK annually from reduced setup time and support overhead\n\n## Open Questions\n\nBased on the action items from our initial analysis, several key questions need to be addressed to move forward with this proposal:\n\n### DevSpaces Integration\n\n1. **DevSpaces Readiness for Training:** \n   - Can DevSpaces handle the scale of simultaneous BT101 sessions during peak hiring periods?\n   - What is the timeline for DevSpaces GA release and stability guarantees?\n   - How do we handle DevSpaces outages during critical training sessions?\n\n2. **Blueprint Management:**\n   - Who will own and maintain the BT101 DevSpace blueprint?\n   - How frequently should the blueprint be updated as tools evolve?\n   - Can we version blueprints to support different BT101 variations?\n\n### Automation and Provisioning\n\n3. **Embark Hook Implementation:**\n   - What technical barriers exist for integrating with the new hire Embark workflow?\n   - How do we handle edge cases where automatic provisioning fails?\n   - What fallback mechanisms should be in place?\n\n4. **Personal Bindle Auto-Population:**\n   - How do we automatically grant source code access to new hire personal bindles?\n   - What security reviews are required for automated permission grants?\n   - How do we handle contractors or temporary employees with different access levels?\n\n### Burner Account Management\n\n5. **Automated Burner Account Creation:**\n   - Can we create a pool of pre-provisioned burner accounts for instant assignment?\n   - How do we handle account cleanup after training completion?\n   - What are the cost implications of maintaining a burner account pool?\n\n6. **Account Bootstrap Automation:**\n   - Can the manual bootstrap process be fully automated?\n   - How do we handle AWS service limits during bulk account creation?\n   - What monitoring is needed to ensure account health?\n\n### Organizational Considerations\n\n7. **Team Ownership:**\n   - Should this be owned by the Builder Tools team, Training team, or a joint effort?\n   - How do we coordinate between DevSpaces, BuilderHub, and BT101 teams?\n   - Who provides ongoing support for the quickstart infrastructure?\n\n8. **Migration Strategy:**\n   - How do we transition from the current BT101 process to the DevSpaces-based approach?\n   - Should we run both systems in parallel during transition?\n   - How do we update all existing documentation and training materials?\n\n### Technical Constraints\n\n9. **Generic Burner Applications:**\n   - Can we create generic burner applications that work for all new hires?\n   - How do we handle team-specific customizations or requirements?\n   - What about fleet owner permissions and resource allocation?\n\n10. **Scalability and Performance:**\n    - What is the maximum number of concurrent DevSpaces we can support?\n    - How do we ensure consistent performance during high-volume periods?\n    - What infrastructure investments are needed to support this scale?\n\n### Success Metrics\n\n11. **Measurement and Validation:**\n    - How do we measure success beyond setup time reduction?\n    - What metrics should we track for continuous improvement?\n    - How do we gather feedback from new hires using the new system?\n\nThese questions need to be addressed through collaboration with the DevSpaces team, BuilderHub, Embark owners, and AWS account management teams to ensure a successful implementation of the BT101 Quickstart initiative.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":90,"oldLines":11,"newStart":90,"newLines":11,"lines":[" "," ### Expected Outcomes"," ","-- **Setup time reduction:** From TK hours to under 1 minute","-- **Support ticket reduction:** Estimated TK% decrease in #sb-onboarding-help volume","+- **Setup time reduction:** From **TK** hours to under 1 minute","+- **Support ticket reduction:** Estimated **TK%** decrease in #sb-onboarding-help volume"," -
