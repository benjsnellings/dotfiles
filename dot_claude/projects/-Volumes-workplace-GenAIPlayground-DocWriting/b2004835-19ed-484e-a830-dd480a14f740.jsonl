These criteria are not a checklist.  Every promotion case is unique; the results you deliver (and how they are delivered) also play a role in promotion evaluations.\nScope and Influence\n•    You successfully lead a strategic team effort requiring work from multiple team members. You are accountable for the design of this effort, even though you did not personally author every component. \n•    You influence your team’s long-term technical investments by making insightful contributions to team priorities and approach. You consider where your software needs to be flexible to evolve in the future.\n•    You help your team understand and plan for the impact of their decisions on the team’s architecture. \n•    You ensure that everyone’s voice is considered when making decisions. You make an inclusive space for others to voice their views.\n•    You actively mentor other engineers.\nAmbiguity\n•    You seek to understand the customer problem you’re solving before finalizing a solution. Your work brings clarity to problems where the solution was originally ambiguous.\n•    You understand that many problems are not new and explore re-use or extending existing solutions first.\n•    You apply judgment and experience to make the right software design and implementation trade-offs.\nProblem Complexity\n•    You solve problems that are complex using solutions that are as simple as possible; this may require modification or deprecation of software.\n•    You demonstrate the ability to discover and mitigate unknown risks and roadblocks.\nExecution\n•    Your implementation decisions demonstrate best practices. You work very efficiently, delivering frequently and incrementally.\n•    You effectively communicate your technical designs and decisions in writing. You are still learning how to write for non-technical audiences.\n•    You seek diverse perspectives, listen to feedback, and are willing to change direction. \n•    You lead design reviews for your team and actively participate in design reviews for your team and adjacent teams. \nImpact\n•    Your work positively impacts the software (e.g., quality, customer experience, maintainability, delivery rate) of your team’s product(s) and are beginning to have positive impact on related team's product(s).\n•    You balance speed of execution with architectural requirements.\n•    You take the lead in identifying and solving architecture deficiencies or areas where your team’s software bottlenecks innovation. You work to reduce support costs in your team by addressing systemic issues.\n•    You lead ongoing operational support for your team.

When faced with ambiguity around cross-region networking solutions, Itrat drove critical discussions with Traffic Engineering to understand their long-term vision and validated the necessity of SuperStar for NAWS services, then aligned with multiple stakeholders on the integration approach. Itrat identified and resolved a critical scalability issue with IAM role bootstrapping that \"has a potential of failing in some situations that might be more common than not,\" leading the SuperStar team to fast-track their CTS (Conduit Trusted Service) solution, demonstrating the ability to discover and mitigate unknown risks while influencing technical direction across teams.\n\nItrat's execution resulted in significant business impact - all new services created with BuilderHubCreate Fargate template now have SuperStar integration by default, establishing the foundation for region flexibility features and enabling future convoy integration and auth-by-default features. Throughout the project, Itrat managed parallel workstreams across teams, implemented GoldenPath template modifications proactively to elicit early feedback, and successfully unblocked the BuilderHubCreate team when they encountered permission and service onboarding issues with the MAGIC team (ticket D174293159). Itrat's work included coordinating the SuperStar team's CTS solution release, BuilderHubCreate team's CTS enablement, and GoldenPath template modifications, while providing architectural recommendations on resource deployment order and stack organization to ensure compatibility with auth-by-default features.\n\n## Best Reasons Not to Promote\n\nWhile Itrat successfully led this technical initiative and demonstrated strong cross-team coordination, the work summary only provides evidence from a single project launched in January 2024, which may not demonstrate the sustained L6-level performance typically expected for promotion.

You should only accept a feedback request if you’re able to speak to the employee’s performance with specific examples.\n\n    Read the role guideline for the employee’s role. Reference the Moving to criteria as a benchmark to evaluate your observations against. Remember the role guidelines are not a checklist. You may not have had the opportunity to observe the employee's performance on all criteria. Focus on those that you've had the most experience with and that you believe to be the most important to the role.\n\n    Provide context. Set up your feedback with a full explanation of your relationship to the employee (e.g., which projects did you work on together, how often did you meet with them).\n\n    Be specific and objective. Use objective metrics (numerical data points) or narrative examples (such as Voice of the Customer quotes) to back up your observations and describe both the employee’s contributions and impact. Make sure the contributions are specific to the employee, and not attributed to the team.\n\n    Reference the Leadership Principles. Connecting examples of work to the Leadership Principles\n\nshows how the employee is using our peculiar culture to be effective.\n\nAim for universal language. Avoid team-specific terms or industry buzz words, unless they are commonly used across Amazon. If you use an acronym, spell it out the first time it appears.\n\nBe balanced. Quality feedback assures the promotion approver that you’ve carefully considered this promotion by discussing the employee’s strengths as well as their opportunities for growth.

Based on these guidelines and sticking strictly to what's documented in the work summary, here are the refined sections:\n\n## Best Reasons to Promote\n\nItrat exemplified L6-level technical leadership by successfully leading the SuperStar Integration in BuilderHubCreate as Tech Lead, a strategic initiative requiring coordination across five teams (BuilderHubCreate, GoldenPath, SuperStar, Traffic Engineering, and MAGIC). When faced with ambiguous requirements and no clear guidance on cross-region networking solutions, Itrat demonstrated strong Ownership and Dive Deep by driving discussions with Traffic Engineering to validate SuperStar's necessity for NAWS services and aligning with the SuperStar team on integration approach. Most notably, Itrat identified a critical scalability issue where the IAM role bootstrapping method \"has a potential of failing in some situations that might be more common than not\" and influenced the SuperStar team to fast-track their Conduit Trusted Service (CTS) solution, showing the ability to discover and mitigate unknown risks while delivering the Right Results through simpler, more scalable architecture.\n\nThe business impact of Itrat's work is substantial - all new services created with BuilderHubCreate Fargate template now have SuperStar integration by default, providing out-of-the-box network connectivity for NAWS services and establishing the foundation for convoy integration and auth-by-default features. Itrat demonstrated Deliver Results by managing parallel workstreams (SuperStar's CTS release, BuilderHubCreate's CTS enablement, GoldenPath template modifications), implementing changes proactively to gather early feedback (CR-150644194), and unblocking the BuilderHubCreate team when MAGIC team issues arose (ticket D174293159). Through weekly status updates and effective stakeholder management, Itrat successfully guided this complex integration to launch in January 2024, positively impacting the architecture and delivery capabilities of new services across the organization.\n\n## Best Reasons Not to Promote\n\nWhile Itrat successfully delivered the SuperStar integration project, the feedback is based on a single project that launched in January 2024, which may not demonstrate the sustained L6-level performance and consistent impact across multiple initiatives typically expected for promotion. The work summary doesn't provide evidence of Itrat mentoring other engineers or creating inclusive spaces for team members to voice their views, both explicit expectations for L6 Scope and Influence criteria.\n\nAdditionally, there's limited evidence of Itrat's broader influence on the team's long-term technical investments beyond this specific integration or examples of leading ongoing operational support and making trade-offs between operational improvements and feature work.
