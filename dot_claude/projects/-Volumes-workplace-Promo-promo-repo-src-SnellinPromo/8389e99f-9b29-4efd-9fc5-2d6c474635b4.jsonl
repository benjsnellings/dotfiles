These criteria are not a checklist. Every promotion case is unique; the results you deliver (and how they are delivered) also play a role in promotion evaluations.\n\n### Scope and Influence\n- **Technical Strategy**: You define a technical strategy and roadmap spanning multiple teams. You influence senior management to take goals and investments to achieve that strategy.\n- **Mentorship**: You have demonstrated you can grow, mentor, and guide others to be successful L6 engineers.\n- **Consensus Building**: You understand that your words have a large impact. You respectfully drive closure on contentious topics.\n- **Problem Seeking**: You actively seek out related problems and solutions, leveraging and learning from previous work.\n- **Simplification**: You simplify, reducing software and system duplication within your organization.\n\n### Ambiguity\n- **Risk Prioritization**: You identify and influence prioritization of projects that resolve risks affecting your organization.\n- **Decision Investment**: You invest your time in decisions that cannot be easily reversed. Your organization can make decisions that are easily reversible without needing your input.\n- **Adaptability**: You adapt how you work to meet the needs of the team, project, and product.\n\n### Problem Complexity\n- **Multi-dimensional Problems**: You solve problems that have substantial risks and conflicting constraints along multiple dimensions.\n- **Architecture Trade-offs**: You make good tradeoffs between short-term delivery and long-term maintainability of your organization's architecture.\n- **Risk Identification**: You identify risks that are not readily apparent and proactively take action to prevent problems before they occur.\n\n### Execution\n- **Technical Communication**: Your technical designs and other written artifacts are effective at creating alignment with coworkers that you work with regularly as well as technical leaders within your organization or related organizations. You are still learning how to write for non-technical leadership (e.g. business partners, finance partners).\n- **Culture Leadership**: You promote and exemplify a culture of inclusiveness, communication, quality, and pragmatism in your organization. Your artifacts and behaviors are a positive role model for others.\n- **Responsibility Division**: You divide responsibilities so that others can work independently and have the pieces come together as an integrated whole.\n- **Hands-on Focus**: You remain hands on. You focus your time on the code and code reviews that have the most impact on your product (e.g., a prototype that informs the direction, the interfaces that define the boundaries between components, the complex critical-path implementation, a refactor that helps gain operational stability).\n- **Practitioner Delivery**: You demonstrate significant deliveries as a \"practitioner\", which typically includes detailed technical design and code-reviewed code.\n\n### Impact\n- **Operational Excellence**: You drive improvements that enable your organization to effectively insist on the highest operational excellence standards.\n- **Strategic Alignment**: You align teams across your organization towards cohesive technical strategies/vision.\n- **Meaningful Feedback**: Coworkers and leadership within your organization choose to incorporate your feedback because it is meaningful, actionable, and demonstrates good judgement.\n- **Organizational Strength**: Your organization is stronger because of your presence, but does not depend upon your presence to be successful.\n- **Goal Alignment**: Your delivery directly ties to organization-level goals.\n\n## Complete L7 Principal SDE Role Description\n\nPrincipal SDEs independently lead software delivery across an organization. They deliver architectures consisting of multiple software systems spanning the full software lifecycle including design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance strategy. They drive clarity; often neither the business problem nor technology strategy is well defined. They do not design every feature themselves; they review the work of other Engineers to ensure a cohesive delivery.\n\nPrincipal SDEs' code contributions demonstrate best practices, which others emulate, and continue to be of high-quality (See FAQ 5 for the definition of the \"Amazon Code Bar\"). They balance constraints, limiting short-term workarounds but understanding that speed of delivery is important.\n\nPrincipal SDEs often solve problems with non-technical solutions such as process improvement, culture changes, or staffing and training. They handle escalations and drive closure with their peers, Directors, and stakeholders. Principal SDEs set the standard for engineering excellence for their organization. They understand others' unique skillsets and leverage them effectively. They ensure their organization grows by training, recruiting, assessing, and providing career guidance to senior ICs within their organization.\n\n### What you do as a Principal SDE\n\nPrincipal SDEs who consistently demonstrate the following capabilities, in addition to the capabilities of an SDE 1, SDE 2, and SDE 3, are exceeding in their role.\n\n#### Scope and Influence\n- **Strategic Influence**: You are a key influencer for strategic decisions in your organization. You bring technology and industry context to business decisions.\n- **Consensus Building**: You are adept at building consensus and driving closure on contentious topics.\n- **Community Growth**: You help grow the Principal Engineering community (e.g., through candidate informationals, interviews, and promotion assessments).\n- **Cross-org Alignment**: You align the technical strategy of your organization with adjacent organizations.\n- **Senior Talent Development**: You guide the career growth of the most senior technical talent in your organization. You participate in performance evaluations and advocate for the careers of others.\n\n#### Ambiguity\n- **Adaptive Working**: You adapt how you work to meet the needs of the team, project, and product.\n- **Hard Problem Identification**: You identify intrinsically hard problems (e.g., major bottleneck or existing architectural complexity that slow down or prevent innovation, pose a critical business or security risk, undefined opportunity with potentially high impact).\n- **Long-term Investment**: You understand business and customer needs and identify long-term technology investments that solve for those needs.\n\n#### Problem Complexity\n- **Intrinsic Complexity**: You tackle intrinsically hard problems, acquiring expertise as needed.\n- **Multi-faceted Problems**: You deal with problems that are significantly complex not only because of technical complexity.\n- **Architecture Focus**: You focus on the long-term maintainability of your organization's architecture using judgement to balance short-term business deliverables.\n- **Multi-dimensional Constraints**: You solve problems that have substantial risks and conflicting constraints along multiple dimensions.\n- **Proactive Risk Management**: You identify risks that are not readily apparent and proactively take action to prevent problems before they occur.\n\n#### Execution\n- **Leadership by Example**: You lead by example; you recognize that every artifact you produce will be used as a role-model for others and act accordingly.\n- **Role Flexibility**: You recognize what role you need to play in a given situation, and shift how you work to meet differing needs.\n- **Knowledge Sharing**: You present at internal conferences and Principal Engineer community events, or find alternative approaches to share your knowledge with a broad audience.\n- **Project Success Ownership**: You take the responsibility for the success of the most important projects in your organization even if you do not directly lead them (e.g., by regularly auditing decisions on projects led by others).\n- **Project Leadership**: At any given time, you take the lead on one or two projects that are important for your organization. You are able to divide responsibilities so that each team can work independently.\n- **Solution Focus**: You seek solutions, even when those solutions are hard to find. You are not satisfied with just identifying problems.\n\n#### Impact\n- **Engineering Standards**: You ensure that your organization adheres to appropriately high standards for the full lifecycle of engineering and operations (e.g., by creating mechanisms to review COEs, regularly reviewing dashboards, creating release automation guardrails).\n- **Design Review Leadership**: You amplify your impact by leading design reviews for complex software projects and/or critical features. You probe assumptions, illuminate pitfalls, and foster shared understanding.\n- **Voice Amplification**: You amplify the voices of others to ensure the most impactful ideas reach the right audiences.\n- **Expertise Recognition**: You recognize you are not the expert on everything, and seek out others with expertise needed to make the right decisions.\n- **Lasting Change**: You create positive and lasting change on the architecture and technical abstractions of your organization. You guide decisions to be intentional, incremental, and aligned toward long-term goals.\n\n## TPA Checklist Requirements\n\nL7s are the primary drivers of product strategy, definition, and execution at Amazon, and are expected to not only define what execution is on complex problems, but also to long term look around corners and think big, and resolve highly ambiguous technical and market situations.\n\n### Key Requirements:\n- **History of high positive impact on the business**\n  - Need delivered quantitative impact history not just projected\n  - GP updates, Auth-By-Default, Deep Ping\n  - Revenue and/or cost reduction or time to market reduction\n- **Being a technical leader within a director's organization**\n  - Influence over BHC and GP\n- **Influence within at least a VP's organization**\n- **The ability to originate and promote a multi-year technical vision**\n- **Writing samples**: PR/FAQs, OP1/OP2 docs, product roadmaps, presentations (broadcast), wikis, email archives (sole author is important)\n  - TWIST, DevCon Workshop and Compute Panel, Quips, WorkDocs, Runbooks service\n- **Code contributions**: significant CRs and reviews, CR and review history (in touch with details)\n- **Scope**: want to see 20+ engineers, including multiple SDE3s\n- **Mentoring history**: should be mentoring other SDE3s, evidence of growing and executing through others\n- **History of seeing around corners, vision doc**\n\n## Role Guidelines Mapping (L6 vs L7)\n\n### Scope and Influence\n\n#### L6 → L7 Transition\n**L6**: You lead projects that require the work of multiple engineers.\n**L7**: You define a technical strategy and roadmap spanning multiple teams.
