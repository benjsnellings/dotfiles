How to contribute or leave feedback\\\\n# How to contribute or leave feedback[¶][1]\\\\n* [How you can help][2]\\\\n* [Support for doc contributors][3]\\\\n* [More information][4]\\\\nWe encourage contributions and feedback for all documentation on BuilderHub! This documentation is _open-source_ and is written, argued about, and updated by ASBX teams and contributors like _you_.\\\\n## How you can help[¶][2]\\\\n_You_ can directly improve any documentation on BuilderHub!\\\\n* **Contribute directly** – every doc page on BuilderHub is built from text source files that you can view by clicking the Page source link in the footer. Doing this also reveals the source package and file that contains the documentation source. Once you have that, you have two options to edit the documentation:\\\\nThe required CR reviewers for all BuilderHub doc packages are _included by default_, so you will typically not need to add additional reviewers, or even to notify the documentation team about updates. Your changes will be reviewed and if accepted, will be merged and published automatically.\\\\nFor information about and best practices for formatting and styling your content, view the [general formatting guidelines][7] to help get your CR accepted easily, and the topics within the [ASBX Documentation style guide][8] can help you write docs like a pro. :)\\\\nTip\\\\nSee this Broadcast video for a 6-minute introduction to editing BuilderHub content!\\\\n[Contributing to BuilderHub Docs - Editing Files \\\\\\\\(Code Browser & development environment\\\\\\\\)][9]\\\\n * For small (one-page) changes, typo fixes and the like, you can [edit the page using Code Browser][5].\\\\n * For larger, multi-page changes or to add or remove pages, you should [edit the documentation package locally][6] using your favorite text editor.\\\\n\\\\n* **Provide feedback** – Select the Provide feedback link on the page footer to communicate directly with the team that owns the page. Let them know if anything seems missing, wrong, confusing, or even if you just want to provide positive feedback (”_I really liked this topic, thank you!_”).\\\\n## Support for doc contributors[¶][3]\\\\nIf you are a writer or developer at Amazon who’s interested in contributing to the documentation or helping to review new content on BuilderHub, join the [btdocs-interest][10] email list to help coordinate our group-wide effort to improve Amazon’s internal developer documentation for the good of all!\\\\nWe also have a [similarly-named Slack channel][11] that you can use to participate interactively with the ASBX doc team and with other contributors.\\\\nSee the [ASBX Documentation support page][12] for a full list of all support options, including 1:1 help.\\\\n## More information[¶][4]\\\\nFor more information about ASBX Documentation, visit our [meta-documentation site][13] and [team wiki][14].\\\\nPrevious page:[Welcome to ASBX documentation on BuilderHub!][15]\\\\n[1]: #how-to-contribute-or-leave-feedback\\\\n[2]: #how-you-can-help\\\\n[3]: #support-for-doc-contributors\\\\n[4]: #more-information\\\\n[5]: https://btdocs.builder-tools.aws.dev/writing/contributing-code-browser.html\\\\n[6]: https://btdocs.builder-tools.aws.dev/writing/contributing-desktop.html\\\\n[7]: https://btdocs.builder-tools.aws.dev/writing/formatting-general.html\\\\n[8]: https://btdocs.builder-tools.aws.dev/writing/style.html\\\\n[9]: https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/989181\\\\n[10]: https://email-list.corp.amazon.com/email-list/expand-list/btdocs-interest\\\\n[11]: https://amzn-aws.slack.com/archives/C01UWQ217CJ\\\\n[12]: https://btdocs.builder-tools.aws.dev/support/\\\\n[13]: https://btdocs.builder-tools.aws.dev/\\\\n[14]: https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BuilderTools/Documentation\\\\n[15]: ../\\\"}}\"},{\"url\":\"https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/learning/bt111-add-a-member-to-the-model/\",\"displayTitle\":\"BT111: Add a member to the model\",\"domain\":\"builder_hub\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1755820800000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":2,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"Add a new member to the model[¶][3]\\\\n1. In your project, navigate to the directory containing your Coral model (`BT111_username_Model`) and open the `main.smithy` file in the `src/main/smithy` directory. This is where you’ll make updates to your data model.\\\\n2. Locate the definition for the `Beer` structure in the `main.smithy` file. It should look something like this:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nstructure Beer {\\\\n beerId: beerId\\\\n\\\\n @required\\\\n name: name\\\\n\\\\n description: description\\\\n\\\\n beerCompanyName: beerCompanyName\\\\n\\\\n beerTypeName: beerTypeName\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n3. Below the existing members, add the `priceInDollars` member:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nstructure Beer {\\\\n beerId: beerId\\\\n\\\\n @required\\\\n name: name\\\\n\\\\n description: description\\\\n\\\\n beerCompanyName: beerCompanyName\\\\n\\\\n beerTypeName: beerTypeName\\\\n\\\\n @required\\\\n @default(0)\\\\n priceInDollars: priceInDollars\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n@range(min:0)\\\\n@default(0)\\\\ninteger priceInDollars\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nImportant\\\\nRemember to save every time you edit a file if you don’t have autosave enabled in your IDE.\\\\n4. Next, implement the new member in your `BeerActivity.java` file so it appears in outputs. In `BT111_username_/src/main/java/com/amazon/bt111_username_/activity/BeerActivity.java`, add the following line:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nBeer beerWithAssignedId = new Beer.Builder()\\\\n .withBeerId(NEXT_BEER_ID.getAndIncrement())\\\\n .withName(inBeer.getName())\\\\n .withDescription(inBeer.getDescription())\\\\n .withBeerCompanyName(inBeer.getBeerCompanyName())\\\\n .withBeerTypeName(inBeer.getBeerTypeName())\\\\n .withPriceInDollars(inBeer.getPriceInDollars())\\\\n .build();\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n5. Now that you’ve updated the Smithy model, run:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-recursive-cmd --allPackages brazil-build\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nThis will trigger the build process to regenerate all the Coral artifacts based on the updated Smithy model.\\\\nNote\\\\nIf you notice that the `withPriceInDollars` and `getPriceInDollars` methods in your IDE are unresolved:\\\\n* IntelliJ: From the main menu, run Brazil ‣ Sync From Workspace (Enhanced) to resolve them.\\\\n* VS Code: From the main menu, select View ‣ Command Palette… Then search `bemol` and select Run bemol to resolve dependencies.\\\\n## Amazon Q Developer context commands[¶][4]\\\\nNow that you’ve made changes to your model, explore how to use Amazon Q Developer’s context commands to analyze your code more effectively. When chatting with it in your IDE, you can provide additional context like files and folders to get more tailored answers.\\\\nYou can provide context in two ways:\\\\n* **Explicitly** using `@` commands in the chat window.\\\\n* **Automatically** through pre-configured project settings.\\\\nAfter Amazon Q Developer generates an answer, it shows the files it used as context in a dropdown above the response.\\\\n### Explicit context with `@` commands[¶][5]\\\\nType `@` in the chat to access these context options:\\\\n* `@workspace` - Analyzes your entire project workspace (requires setup, covered in the next section)\\\\n* `@file` - References specific files for targeted analysis\\\\n* `@folder` - Includes entire directories in the context\\\\n* `@code` - References classes, functions, and variables from your project\\\\n* `@prompt` - Uses saved prompts as context (requires setup, covered later in this workshop)\\\\nIn this module, you’ll use `@workspace` to analyze all your BT111 project files when verifying the model changes.\\\\n#### Set up workspace context[¶][6]\\\\n1. Click Amazon Q at the bottom of your IDE.\\\\n2. Select Open Settings from the Amazon Q task bar that opens.\\\\n3. Click the box next to Workspace Index.\\\\n### Automatic context[¶][7]\\\\nAmazon Q Developer can automatically use context you’ve set up outside of chat:\\\\n* **Project rules** - Automatically applied rules you define for your project\\\\n* **Active file** - The currently open and visible file in your editor is automatically included as context\\\\n* **Customizations** - Repository-based context for enhanced suggestions (more information on customizations found [HERE][11])\\\\n#### Set up a project rule[¶][8]\\\\nProject rules can be used to assist with consistent code quality and style across your team. These rules are automatically applied to all Amazon Q Developer interactions within your project and provide context-aware suggestions that align with your coding standards. In this section, you’ll create a rule that enforces style and syntax standards for your Coral service.\\\\n1. In your IDE, open the Amazon Q chat panel.\\\\n2. In the input box, click the Rules button.\\\\n3. Select Create new rule.\\\\n4. In the dialog that appears, enter a name for your rule (e.g., `style`).\\\\nThis will create a Markdown file with that name in your project’s `_project-root_/.amazonq/rules` folder.\\\\n5. Add the following rule content in the editor:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nAll Java code in this Coral service must adhere to the following style guidelines:\\\\n\\\\n1. Use 4 spaces for indentation, never tabs.\\\\n2. Limit line length to 120 characters.\\\\n3. Lines should have no trailing spaces.\\\\n4. Include type hints (via Java Generics) for all method parameters and return values.\\\\n5. Imports should be organized into sections (standard library, third-party, local) and alphabetized.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n6. Save the file.\\\\nOnce saved, this rule will automatically influence Amazon Q Developer’s responses when you ask questions about your BT111 project.\\\\nTip\\\\nYou can copy and paste existing coding style documentation from your team or organization (such as Amazon’s internal coding standards) directly into project rules. This allows Amazon Q Developer to automatically follow your established conventions without needing to recreate them from scratch.\\\\n## Verify changes in the generated code[¶][9]\\\\nSince your build was completed successfully, you can inspect the generated code to confirm the new `priceInDollars` member was added. To verify that the code generation worked correctly, open a Amazon Q Developer chat window and ask:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n@workspace Search all generated classes and check each one for a priceInDollars field.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nThis will help you confirm that the new member was properly generated across all relevant files. You can also manually open the `Beer.java` file in your service package to confirm (use the search function in your IDE):\\\\n(`BT111_username_/build/private/gradle/generated/sources/annotationProcessor/java/main/com/amazon/bt111_username_/Beer.java`)\\\\nYou should see something like this:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nprotected int priceInDollars;\\\\n/**\\\\n* Sets the value of the field \\\\\\\"priceInDollars\\\\\\\" to be used for the constructed object.\\\\n* @param priceInDollars\\\\n* The value of the \\\\\\\"priceInDollars\\\\\\\" field.\\\\n* @return\\\\n* This builder.\\\\n*/\\\\npublic Builder withPriceInDollars(int priceInDollars) {\\\\n this.priceInDollars = priceInDollars;\\\\n return this;\\\\n}\\\\n/**\\\\n* Sets the fields of the given instances to the corresponding values recorded when calling the \\\\\\\"with\\\\\\\" methods.\\\\n* @param instance\\\\n* The instance to be populated.\\\\n*/\\\\nprotected void populate(Beer instance) {\\\\n instance.setBeerId(this.beerId);\\\\n instance.setName(this.name);\\\\n instance.setDescription(this.description);\\\\n instance.setBeerCompanyName(this.beerCompanyName);\\\\n instance.setBeerTypeName(this.beerTypeName);\\\\n instance.setPriceInDollars(this.priceInDollars);\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n## Test the updated model using the Coral Explorer[¶][10]\\\\n1. In the service package (`src/BT111_username_`), run the server with:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-build server\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n2. Navigate to `http://_cloud-desktop-hostname_:8080/explorer/index.html` and refresh the page. You may need to perform a hard refresh with cmd+shift+R (macOS) or ctrl+shift+R (Ubuntu or Windows).\\\\n3. Click the CreateBeer link on the left. You should now see the new `priceInDollars` member in the Request Data field.\\\\n4. Change the values of each member and click the Call CreateBeer button to see `priceInDollars` in the response.\\\\nGreat job adding a new member to your model.

Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with AmazonJavaFormat\\\\n# Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with AmazonJavaFormat[¶][1]\\\\n* [Configuration][2]\\\\n* [Usage][3]\\\\n * [Applying PeruGradleJavaPresets with Spotless][4]\\\\n * [Overriding the default Spotless and AmazonJavaFormat settings][5]\\\\n  * [Overriding the default Spotless settings][6]\\\\n  * [Overriding the default AmazonJavaFormat settings][7]\\\\n* [Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with other supported tools][8]\\\\nThis page provides instructions on how to use the [PeruGradleJavaPresets][9] plugin with [AmazonJavaFormat][10] utilizing [Spotless][11].\\\\nImportant\\\\nPlease read [Using code quality tools with PeruGradleJavaPresets][12] before reading this page. It has general instructions and prerequisites on using the PeruGradleJavaPresets plugin.\\\\n## Configuration[¶][2]\\\\nPeruGradleJavaPresets provides the following default settings for Spotless:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nspotless {\\\\n   encoding(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)\\\\n\\\\n   java {\\\\n      // excludes generated source files inside the build, target, generated and generated-src directories\\\\n      targetExclude(\\\\\\\"**/build/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/target/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/generated/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/generated-src/**\\\\\\\");\\\\n      // applies Amazon Java code style\\\\n      addStep(createAmazonJavaFormatStep(\\\\\\\"AMAZON\\\\\\\"))\\\\n\\\\n      // fixes annotations formatting for inline type annotations\\\\n      formatAnnotations()\\\\n      trimTrailingWhitespace()\\\\n      endWithNewline()\\\\n   }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n`isEnforceCheck` is set to `false` if the build is on the build fleet. Otherwise, it is set to `true`.\\\\nPeruGradleJavaPresets provides the following default settings for AmazonJavaFormat:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nformatter.code.style=AMAZON\\\\nformatter.apply.on.build=false\\\\nformatter.fail.on.diff=true\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n`formatter.fail.on.diff` is set to `false` if the build is on the build fleet. Otherwise, it is set to `true`.\\\\nYou can specify your own Spotless and AmazonJavaFormat settings. Refer to [Overriding the default Spotless and AmazonJavaFormat settings][13] for more information.\\\\n## Usage[¶][3]\\\\n### Applying PeruGradleJavaPresets with Spotless[¶][4]\\\\nIn the `plugins` block of your `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`, add the Spotless Gradle plugin along with the PeruGradleJavaPresets plugin:\\\\nGroovybuild.gradle[¶][14]\\\\n```\\\\nplugins {\\\\n   // ...\\\\n   // other plugins\\\\n   // ...\\\\n\\\\n   id 'com.diffplug.spotless' version '6.+'\\\\n   id 'software.amazon.peru.java-presets' version '1.0.+'\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nKotlinbuild.gradle.kts[¶][15]\\\\n```\\\\nplugins {\\\\n   // ...\\\\n   // other plugins\\\\n   // ...\\\\n\\\\n   id(\\\\\\\"com.diffplug.spotless\\\\\\\") version \\\\\\\"6.+\\\\\\\"\\\\n   id(\\\\\\\"software.amazon.peru.java-presets\\\\\\\") version \\\\\\\"1.0.+\\\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n### Overriding the default Spotless and AmazonJavaFormat settings[¶][5]\\\\nIf you want to use your own Spotless or AmazonJavaFormat settings, you can override some or all of the settings provided by the PeruGradleJavaPresets plugin.\\\\n#### Overriding the default Spotless settings[¶][6]\\\\nOverriding default Spotless settings by using the `spotless` block in `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`. For example:\\\\nGroovybuild.gradle[¶][16]\\\\n```\\\\nspotless {\\\\n   setEnforceCheck(true)\\\\n\\\\n   java {\\\\n      target(\\\\\\\"**/src/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/generated-src/**\\\\\\\")\\\\n      targetExclude(\\\\\\\"**/build/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/target/**\\\\\\\")\\\\n   }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nKotlinbuild.gradle.kts[¶][17]\\\\n```\\\\nspotless {\\\\n   isEnforceCheck = true\\\\n\\\\n   java {\\\\n      target(\\\\\\\"**/src/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/generated-src/**\\\\\\\")\\\\n      targetExclude(\\\\\\\"**/build/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/target/**\\\\\\\")\\\\n   }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nSee the [Spotless Gradle plugin Quickstart instructions][18] for more information.\\\\nNote\\\\nIf you only need default Spotless settings provided by PeruGradleJavaPresets, you do not need to modify `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`.\\\\n#### Overriding the default AmazonJavaFormat settings[¶][7]\\\\nOverride default AmazonJavaFormat settings by specifying some Gradle properties in a `gradle.properties` file under the `/project_root`. The following properties are available:\\\\n|Property name|Type|Description|Default value|\\\\n|---|---|---|---|\\\\n|`formatter.code.style`|Enum|Set the code style to use. One of `AMAZON`, `PALANTIR`, `GOOGLE`, `AOSP`.|`AMAZON`|\\\\n|`formatter.apply.on.build`|Boolean|Set if AmazonJavaFormat formats your code automatically when the `assemble` task runs.|`false`|\\\\n|`formatter.fail.on.diff`|Boolean|Set if the build fails when the code is not formatted properly. If you set the value to either `false` or `true` in the `gradle.properties` file, then it will be applied to both local and build fleet builds.|`false` if the build is on the build fleet. `true` if the build is not on the build fleet (local build).|\\\\n\\\\nFor example:\\\\ngradle.properties[¶][19]\\\\n```\\\\n// ...\\\\n// other properties\\\\n// ...\\\\n\\\\nformatter.code.style=GOOGLE\\\\nformatter.apply.on.build=true\\\\nformatter.fail.on.diff=true\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nNote\\\\nIf you only need default AmazonJavaFormat settings provided by PeruGradleJavaPresets, you do not need to modify `gradle.properties`.\\\\n## Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with other supported tools[¶][8]\\\\n* Instructions on using SpotBugs with PeruGradleJavaPresets configurations: [Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with SpotBugs][20]\\\\n* Instructions on using JaCoCo with PeruGradleJavaPresets configurations: [Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with JaCoCo][21]\\\\n* Instructions on using Checkstyle with PeruGradleJavaPresets configurations: [Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with Checkstyle][22]\\\\nNext page:[Vending code for Peru][23]Previous page:[Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with Checkstyle][22]\\\\n[1]: #using-perugradlejavapresets-with-amazonjavaformat\\\\n[2]: #configuration\\\\n[3]: #usage\\\\n[4]: #applying-perugradlejavapresets-with-spotless\\\\n[5]: #overriding-the-default-spotless-and-amazonjavaformat-settings\\\\n[6]: #overriding-the-default-spotless-settings\\\\n[7]: #overriding-the-default-amazonjavaformat-settings\\\\n[8]: #using-perugradlejavapresets-with-other-supported-tools\\\\n[9]: https://code.amazon.com/packages/PeruGradleJavaPresets\\\\n[10]: https://code.amazon.com/packages/AmazonJavaFormat\\\\n[11]: https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-gradle\\\\n[12]: ../howto-java-presets-gradle-plugin/\\\\n[13]: #overriding-default-spotless-and-amazonjavaformat-settings\\\\n[14]: #id3\\\\n[15]: #id4\\\\n[16]: #id5\\\\n[17]: #id6\\\\n[18]: https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/blob/main/plugin-gradle/README.md#quickstart\\\\n[19]: #id7\\\\n[20]: ../howto-java-presets-gradle-plugin-with-spotbugs/\\\\n[21]: ../howto-java-presets-gradle-plugin-with-jacoco/\\\\n[22]: ../howto-java-presets-gradle-plugin-with-checkstyle/\\\\n[23]: ../vending-code/\\\"}}\"},{\"url\":\"https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/crux/user-guide/howto-creating-review/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Creating a code review\",\"domain\":\"builder_hub\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1755820800000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":4,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\",\\\"relativeHrefsDescription\\\":\\\"Relative hrefs represent related documents that can be accessed by evaluating the relative path with respect to the input URL.

Creating a code review\\\\n# Creating a code review[¶][1]\\\\n* [General procedure][2]\\\\n* [Creating a review for an arbitrary diff][3]\\\\n* [See also][4]\\\\nCode reviews are created using the [CRUX CLI][5]. You can create code reviews for any packages in a [Brazil workspace][6]. However, avoid creating reviews across multiple Brazil workspaces, which can cause issues. Code reviews can also be created for any GitFarm repositories that are located on your host.\\\\nNote\\\\nCRUX is only available for [GitFarm][7] and is not supported with any other source code management system.\\\\n## General procedure[¶][2]\\\\nTo create a new code review (CR) with CRUX:\\\\n1. Run the **cr** command from the git root where a code change is committed and follow the output link. If you have more than one package in your workspace that you’d like to have in the same review, then run **cr** from the `src` directory and use the `--include` option to add each package individually, or the `--all` option to include any package with un-pushed commits.\\\\n![../_images/crux-1-create.png][8]\\\\n2. On the code review page, enter a summary and notes for the reviewers. Use [CommonMark][9] to format the content and modify the description as required.\\\\n3. Individual commits and their descriptions are listed at Commits tab.\\\\n4. Reviewers can be added in the Reviewers tab. You can add individual users, LDAP/POSIX groups, and Teams. When you publish this code review everyone listed here will be emailed. To notify a mailing list, use a Team with that list associated with it. Otherwise all group members will be included individually.\\\\n5. Names of people, teams, and groups will be autocompleted. Click a name or highlight it and press Enter to add that person or group to the review. Autocomplete searches for teams/groups by name and people by name, login, and role and is case-insensitive. Groups auto-generated from Teams will only show the Team.\\\\n6. If you need to edit the summary or notes, access the Details tab and click on Actions ‣ Edit Details. Both summary and description will be available for update.\\\\n7. Once you are satisfied with your summary, notes, and reviewers you can click outside of this dialog to go straight to the diff.\\\\n8. Clicking Publish Review will send notifications to all of the reviewers so they can come see it and leave comments.\\\\n## Creating a review for an arbitrary diff[¶][3]\\\\nArbitrary diff code reviews are now supported.\\\\nAt the moment you can create a code review for any diff compliant to any of these formats:\\\\n* [Unified format][10]\\\\n* [Git patch format][11]\\\\nFor more information please refer to the [blog post][12].\\\\nIf you are using the **diff** tool, you must specify the number of lines of unified context. To get the full context (required by CRUX) specify a number greater than the number of lines in your file.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ndiff -U 1000 current.sql proposed.sql | cr --arbitrary-diff-create-personal-pkg -a -\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n## See also[¶][4]\\\\n* [Publishing revisions][13]\\\\nNext page:[Publishing revisions][13]Previous page:[Using CRUX][14]\\\\n[1]: #creating-a-code-review\\\\n[2]: #general-procedure\\\\n[3]: #creating-a-review-for-an-arbitrary-diff\\\\n[4]: #see-also\\\\n[5]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/crux/cli-guide/getting-started.html\\\\n[6]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/brazil/user-guide/concepts-workspace.html\\\\n[7]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/gitfarm/index.html\\\\n[8]: ../_images/crux-1-create.png\\\\n[9]: https://commonmark.org/help/\\\\n[10]: http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Detailed-Unified.html#Detailed%20Unified\\\\n[11]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff#_generating_patches_with_p\\\\n[12]: https://builderhub.corp.amazon.com/blog/arbitrary-diff-support-for-crux-is-now-available\\\\n[13]: ../howto-publishing-revision/\\\\n[14]: ../howto/\\\"}}\"},{\"url\":\"https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/coverlay/user-guide/concept-safeguard/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Understanding Safeguard\",\"domain\":\"builder_hub\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1755820800000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":5,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"etadata APIs) are excluded.\\\\n* **Languages without coverage frameworks** - Changes made to code with no coverage data are implicitly excluded. A change is considered to have coverage data if the _coverage gutter_ on the code review has coverage states marked. Shell scripts, configuration files, etc. typically do not have coverage data.\\\\n* **Test packages** - Packages which solely contain integration test code, load generators or canaries are excluded.\\\\n* **Infra-as-code** - Packages which configure application definitions (LPT, CDK) are excluded.\\\\n#### New line[¶][9]\\\\nLines of code that are added or modified as part of the changes-under-review.\\\\n#### New line coverage[¶][10]\\\\nEnforces the percentage of lines covered, but only for lines which were added or modified by the CR. This allows teams whose packages have low coverage to incrementally improve the line coverage over time. This check is also configured as an integer value between 0 and 100. If the value is set to 0, Coverlay ignores the package new line coverage percent, but still reports it through a comment on your code review.\\\\nNew line coverage is always calculated as the number of covered, modified and executable lines of code divided by the total, modified and executable lines of code—no matter the total count. Thus, if you submit a code review with 4 executable lines modified, at least 3 should be covered to reach 70% new line coverage rule applied by safeguard. If you submit a code review with 3 or fewer lines of code, all of them should be covered.\\\\n#### Coverage framework[¶][11]\\\\nA tool package owners configure to run during build that collects data on which code segments are executed while running the package’s unit tests; this is usually accomplished through markers instrumented into the source code. An example of this is the JaCoCo coverage framework included by default in HappierTrails.\\\\n#### Coverable[¶][12]\\\\nAn adjective describing that the given code segment is not considered executable by unit tests. Coverlay infers this from the presence of indexed Covered/Uncovered states in your coverage framework’s report. _Thus, any lines of code without coverage data labels are ignored by safeguard’s checks._\\\\n#### Critical change[¶][13]\\\\nChanges that are likely to change the functionality of the program and could introduce risks. These changes should be unit tested to make sure the code behaves as expected without introducing unexpected errors.\\\\n#### Non-critical change[¶][14]\\\\nUnlike critical changes, some code changes are low-risk and do not require unit tests. These changes will not change the functionality of the program or are not important to test. Currently, Safeguard is recognizing some non-functional or low-risk changes as non-critical changes, and the rest as critical changes. We are progressively detecting more non-critical changes. To understand the current scope of non-critical change, please check [non-critical change scope][26].\\\\n## Safeguard decision-making process[¶][15]\\\\nSafeguard only checks coverage for [new lines][4] (newly added or modified) of code that are coverable. If the unit test coverage for those lines of code passes the threshold set in your organization’s policy (**70%** for now), the code under review will pass Safeguard check. As such, its PASSED /FAILED /SKIPPED /WARNING status will display in your existing Coverlay report comment.\\\\nCode reviews that meet ALL of the following criteria will receive Coverlay approval failures:\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> * The changed packages are deployed to a production-impacting pipeline.\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> * The new line coverage for one or more package changes in the code review is below 70%.\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> * The changed packages are expected to contain unit tests.\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> However, these failures can be bypassed if the code changes in the code review are meant for testing feature changes or promoting prototype changes to pre-prod stages by using a [feature branch][7].\\\\n### Filter out non-critical changes from coverage check[¶][16]\\\\nThe Coverlay team will start from filtering out non-functional changes. Developers occasionally re-format legacy code-bases as part of adopting checkstyle or other team-based standards for styling. In the code review for these changes, any reformatted code that was previously un-tested code will be flagged as uncovered new lines. The change author is not likely to have sufficient context or bandwidth to add unit tests for these sections of code, and the changes should not cause any behavioral difference as they do not modify the syntax tree of the changed source files. Safeguard now filters these changes out from coverage check as they are viewed as non-critical change and exclude them from coverage check. Unit testing is still recommended for these changes. When deciding the total number of lines that are important to be tested, Safeguard will filter out those lines of code that are recognized as non-critical.\\\\n**critical change** - changes that are likely to change the functionality of the program and could introduce risks. These changes should be unit tested to make sure the code behaves as expected without introducing unexpected errors\\\\n**non-critical change** - unlike critical changes, some code changes are low-risk and do no require unit tests. These changes will not change the functionality of the program or are not important to test. Currently, Safeguard is recognizing some non-functional or low-risk changes as non-critical changes, and the rest as critical changes.\\\\n**non-critical uncovered lines** - Safeguard does not enforce unit test coverage on lines of code that are recognized as non-critical changes. If a non-critical line of code change is uncovered, Safeguard check will not be affected. Unit testing is still encouraged for non-critical changes.\\\\n#### Non-critical change scope[¶][17]\\\\nThe first release focuses on reformatting of existing code and in-line comment edits/additions first. Here are some examples of non-critical changes to filter out.\\\\n* **Reformatting changes** - Formatting changes do not affect code logic. Common format changes include changing the order for methods, adding or deleting lines or white space, wrapping a line when it is too long, and etc. If we parse the code into a tree by viewing each object as a tree node and each operation as a branch and ignoring any white space, reformatting change does not change the layout of the parsed tree.\\\\nAn isolated reformatting change is shown in the following image:\\\\n![A screenshot showing example of an isolated reformatting change.][27]If the change includes a mix of reformatting and functional change, it will not be filtered out.\\\\n* **In-line comment edits/additions** - Code comments help with code maintenance and finding bugs, but do not affect the software behavior.\\\\n![A screenshot showing example of in-line comment edits/addition.][28]\\\\n* **Log statements** - Logs that helps to investigate and monitor the service, but do not affect the software behavior. Log statements that contain complicated method calls are not categorized as low-risk, as complicated method calls are more likely to result in unexpected operational changes.\\\\nAn example low-risk log statement:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nlog.info(\\\\\\\"Starting operation \\\\\\\" + getOperationName());\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n* **Print statements** - Print statements that helps to investigate and monitor the service, but do not affect the software behavior. Print statements that contain complicated method calls are not categorized as low-risk, as complicated method calls are more likely to result in unexpected operational changes.\\\\nAn example low-risk print statement:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nSystem.out.println(\\\\\\\"Retrieved following message from queue: \\\\\\\" + getMessage());\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n* **Metrics statements** - Metrics that helps to investigate and monitor the service, but do not affect the software behavior. Metrics statements that contain complicated method calls are not categorized as low-risk, as they are more likely to cause errors and unexpected operational changes.\\\\nAn example low-risk log statement:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nmyCustomizedMetric.addCount(\\\\\\\"Success\\\\\\\", hasSucceeded);\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n* **Enum classes/objects** - An enum type is a special data type that enables a\"},{\"url\":\"https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/learning/bt101-make-code-change/\",\"displayTitle\":\"BT101: Make a code change\",\"domain\":\"builder_hub\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1755820800000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":6,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"ependencies (bemol --verbose) from the command palette.\\\\n## Explore your project with Amazon Q Developer[¶][4]\\\\nNow that you have your workspace open in VS Code, use Amazon Q Developer to help you understand the project structure and codebase.\\\\n1. In VS Code, click the Amazon Q icon in the activity bar on the left side of the window to open the chat panel.\\\\n![\\\\\\\"Amazon Q icon in VS Code\\\\\\\"][34]\\\\n2. In the Amazon Q chat panel, type a prompt asking Q to explain the project structure. For example:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nCan you explain the structure of this project and what the calculator service does?\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nOr:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nExplain the project within this workspace.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n3. Review Amazon Q Developer’s response, which should provide an overview of:\\\\nNote\\\\nAmazon Q Developer analyzes your workspace in real-time to provide contextual information about your code. It can help you understand unfamiliar codebases quickly, which is especially valuable when you’re joining a new team or working with a new service.\\\\n * The overall project structure.\\\\n * The purpose of the calculator service.\\\\n * The key files and their functions.\\\\n * How the code is organized.\\\\n\\\\n4. You can ask follow-up questions to get more specific information about parts of the code you’re interested in. For example:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nWhat does the Calculator.java file do?\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nOr:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nHow are the unit tests structured in this project?\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nNote\\\\nFor guidance on creating effective prompts with Amazon Q Developer, check out the [Prompt Engineering with Amazon Q Developer][35] course.\\\\n5. Take a few minutes to explore the project with Amazon Q Developer before moving on to the next section.\\\\n## Make code changes[¶][5]\\\\nNext, you’ll make a code change. You’ve been assigned your first user story after joining your team, and it looks like you’ll be implementing the functionality of one of your service’s functions. The user story says that the subtraction function needs to be completed, and it mentions that unit tests have already been implemented for the function but are disabled. You should be sure to enable them after implementing the function.\\\\nNote\\\\nFor this training, you’ll use the project view and integrated terminal in the IDE that you installed during the [Developer Environment Setup][36] process. If you have not installed your [IDE and plugins][29], do so now.\\\\n1. Open your `BT101` project folder in your IDE.\\\\n2. Open the file where the code for your lambda function is:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nsrc/com/amazon/bt101_username_/lambda/calculator/Calculator.java\\\\n```\\\\n3. Use Amazon Q Developer’s Fix feature to implement the subtract function:\\\\n 1. With the `Calculator.java` file open, locate the developer’s comment that mentions reusing the add function.\\\\n 2. Highlight the entire `TODO` comment.\\\\n 3. Right-click on the highlighted text and select Amazon Q: Fix from the context menu.\\\\n 4. Amazon Q Developer will automatically generate an implementation for the subtract function based on the highlighted comment and produce a link to a file diff in the chat output. Review the suggested implementation and verify that it:\\\\n * Reuses the add function as mentioned in the comment.\\\\n * Includes appropriate logging statements.\\\\n * Returns the correct result.\\\\n4. Save your changes if you don’t have auto-save enabled in your IDE.\\\\n## Build your changes[¶][6]\\\\n1. To see if your packages build successfully, first go to your package root directory (unless you’re already there):\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ncd ~/workplace/BT101/src/BT101_Username_\\\\n```\\\\n2. Make sure the package will build by using **brazil-build**:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-build\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nImportant\\\\n_If your build fails_, your pipeline may not have finished building the version set. Open up the browser window where you had your pipeline open, or go to https://pipelines.amazon.com and open your BT101 pipeline, and make sure that the status of the VersionSet stage is Succeeded. If it is not, wait for it to finish and then re-run the `brazilworkspacesync` command in the previous step before building. If your build has failed and you verified that your pipeline finished building the version set, you may have an issue with CheckStyle.\\\\n_CheckStyle_ is a source code analyzer used by many teams at Amazon to ensure that code adheres to a coding standard. Standards are set at the team level and any code that does not meet that standard will fail to build.\\\\nCheck the build failure output, and look for the word `CheckStyle`. If you find it, the issue you are facing is likely due to a copy/paste action inserting a tab instead of spaces.\\\\nFind the line number referenced in the build failure. In the referenced line, locate any tab characters and _replace them with spaces_ before running your build command again.\\\\n3. After the build completes successfully, use Amazon Q Developer to learn more about what the **brazil-build** command does:\\\\n 1. Open the Amazon Q panel if it’s not already open.\\\\n 2. Ask Amazon Q Developer to explain the **brazil-build** command by typing a prompt like:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nExplain what the brazil-build command does and what happened during my build process.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n 3. Review Amazon Q Developer’s explanation of the build process.\\\\n\\\\n### Meet a \\\\\\\\(temporary\\\\\\\\) teammate![¶][7]\\\\nIf you’re taking this course online, then ask your onboarding buddy, manager, or someone else on your team to be your “teammate” for the purposes of this activity—they’ll help review your code shortly. They must _also_ have the necessary [development prerequisites][37] to help, however!\\\\nYou can also find a reviewer in the [#sb-onboarding-code-review-requests][38] Slack channel.\\\\n## Create unit tests[¶][8]\\\\nYour teammate had left a comment that the unit tests for the subtract function need to be created. You’ll use Amazon Q Developer to help you create these tests.\\\\n1. Go to your package’s directory now if you’re not already there:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ncd ~/workplace/BT101/src/BT101_Username_\\\\n```\\\\n2. While code is kept in the `src` folder, unit tests are stored in the `tst` folder. Open the file with the unit tests:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ntst/com/amazon/bt101_username_/lambda/calculator/CalculatorTest.java\\\\n```\\\\nTip\\\\nUse tab autocomplete again.\\\\n3. Use Amazon Q Developer to create two new unit tests for the subtract function:\\\\n 1. With the `CalculatorTest.java` file open, click the Amazon Q icon in the activity bar on the left.\\\\n 2. Ask Amazon Q Developer to create two unit tests for the subtract function by typing a prompt like:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nCreate two unit tests for the subtract function in this file: one for a happy path case and one for a bad request case.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n 3. Review the suggested unit tests from Amazon Q Developer and make sure they:\\\\n * Follow the same pattern as the existing tests.\\\\n * Include a happy path test that verifies correct subtraction.\\\\n * Include a bad request test that verifies error handling.\\\\n * Use appropriate assertions and logging.\\\\n\\\\n 4. Make any necessary adjustments to match the coding style of the existing tests.\\\\n\\\\n4. Save your changes.\\\\n5. Make sure the package will still build, and this time run the unit tests as well. The `brazil-buildrelease` command will build your package, run all unit tests, and perform style checks. You can run `brazil-build` just to build your package or `brazil-buildtest` to build and test your package, but for now you’ll run everything.

Running idiomatic coordinate campaigns\\\\n# Running idiomatic coordinate campaigns[¶][2]\\\\nNote\\\\nIdiomatic coordinate campaigns can only be created by members of the security team. If you are not a member of the security team and need assistance creating an idiomatic coordinate campaign, [cut a SIM ticket][3] and the SAS oncall will help create the campaign.\\\\n**Idiomatic Packages \\\\\\\\(IP\\\\\\\\)** are packages in industry-standard package managers like Maven or NPM. They exist in parallel with Brazil packages: an idiomatic package might contain the same software as a Brazil package, but Brazil has its own way of expressing dependencies between packages. Each idiomatic package manager uses _versions_ to distinguish package contents over time. These versions often follow a major.minor.patch convention. An **Idiomatic Package Version \\\\\\\\(IPV\\\\\\\\)** is a `{package,version}` tuple.\\\\nIdiomatic packages and package versions are **Idiomatic Coordinates**. SAS understands idiomatic coordinates in campaign definitions; third-party software maps easily to those coordinates, and SAS can apply those coordinates uniformly across package managers.\\\\nDuring builds that use Peru, idiomatic packages that are pulled in from CodeArtifact repositories are called as **CodeArtifact Package Versions \\\\\\\\(CAPV\\\\\\\\)** and packages in their native format will be referred to as **Idiomatic Package Versions \\\\\\\\(IPV\\\\\\\\)**.\\\\nUse the following guidelines when running idiomatic coordinate campaigns:\\\\n* If you are a member of a security team and have been approved as a super user, you can create a campaign on any idiomatic coordinate. For idiomatic coordinates, SAS supports campaign creation for the types IPV and CAPV.\\\\nNote\\\\nSAS currently only supports creating idiomatic coordinate campaigns for Peru version sets.\\\\n* The correct format for CodeArtifact package versions are as follows:\\\\nMaven CAPV format:\\\\n_PackageType:Namespace:PackageName:Version_\\\\nFor example, `maven:software.amazon.awssdk:core:2.16.52`\\\\nNPM: CAPV format:\\\\n_PackageType:PackageName:Version_\\\\nFor example, `npm:ansi-red:0.1.1`\\\\n* The correct IPV format differs for each package manager. Every package manager has a package type and version but it can also have some additional attributes specific to that package manager. So the following format is used:\\\\n_type:version:key1:value1:key2:value2…._\\\\nIPV examples for Maven:\\\\n`maven:1.1.13:artifact_id:coral-buffer:group_id:com.amazon.coral`\\\\nIPV examples for NPM:\\\\n`npm:4.5.1:name:@amzn/aws-cdk-isengard`\\\\nWhen creating a campaign, you can specify multiple packages separated by commas. Target software is evaluated as a Boolean OR (e.g. target entities containing `maven:com.google.code.gson:gsonORnpm:ansi-red:0.1.1`). Automated Software Update mode cannot be enabled for idiomatic coordinates targets at this time.\\\\n* SUS campaign criteria does not support `AND` / `SET` operations for idiomatic campaigns. Only `Union` / `OR` operations between idiomatic coordinates for an idiomatic campaign are allowed.\\\\nNext page:[Running ticketing campaigns][4]Previous page:[Running GitFarm campaigns][5]\\\\n[1]: ../sas-logo-72px.png\\\\n[2]: #running-idiomatic-coordinate-campaigns\\\\n[3]: https://tiny.amazon.com/uu2cj7ga\\\\n[4]: ../campaigns-ticketing/\\\\n[5]: ../campaigns-gitfarm/\\\"}}\"},{\"url\":\"https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/bats/user-guide/bars-manifest/\",\"displayTitle\":\"BARS Manifest File\",\"domain\":\"builder_hub\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1755820800000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":8,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"n-reaction-user-guide/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/smithy/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/smithy/user-guide/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/smithy/languages/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/smithy/reference/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/sas/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/sas/user-guide/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/sas/api-guide/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/tim/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/tim/user-guide/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/tod/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/tod/user-guide/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/tps-generator/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/tps-generator/user-guide/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/transmogrifier/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/transmogrifier/user-guide/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/transmogrifier/api-guide/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/trebuchet/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/universal-constructs/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/universal-constructs/user-guide/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/viceroy/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/wasabi/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/wasabi/user-guide/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/tools/products-wac/index.html\\\",\\\"../python-default/\\\",\\\"../preserving-symlinks/\\\"],\\\"mainContent\\\":\\\"# BARS Manifest File\\\\n# BARS Manifest File[¶][1]\\\\nThe BARS manifest is used to record all artifacts pushed by the BATS system as part of the Packaging stage inside a pipeline.

This will result in an automatic `version` bump of the manifest file.\\\\n* Any other type of change is non-breaking, and will not result in a `version` bump.\\\\nFor example, support for a new type of artifact `ami` is added and recorded inside the `bars-manifest.json` file under the `amis` field:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\n \\\\\\\"version\\\\\\\": 4,\\\\n \\\\\\\"amis\\\\\\\": [\\\\n {\\\\n \\\\\\\"ami_field_1\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"ami_value_1\\\\\\\"\\\\n }\\\\n ]\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nThis change is not considered to be breaking.\\\\nAlternatively, if multi-requester support is added to a BATS transform, the requester section of the manifest is now expected to be a list:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\n \\\\\\\"version\\\\\\\": 5,\\\\n \\\\\\\"requester\\\\\\\": [\\\\n {\\\\n \\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"5447973\\\\\\\",\\\\n \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Pipeline\\\\\\\",\\\\n \\\\\\\"service\\\\\\\": null\\\\n },\\\\n {\\\\n \\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"5447974\\\\\\\",\\\\n \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Pipeline\\\\\\\",\\\\n \\\\\\\"service\\\\\\\": null\\\\n }\\\\n ]\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nThis type of change will be considered to be breaking.\\\\nNon-breaking change will be made in a silent fashion, where the change is rolled out along regular CICD without explicit process and notifications. Breaking change will be managed via a more visible release process.

Using the CLI\\\\n# Using the CLI[¶][1]\\\\n* [Initiate a code review using the CRUX CLI][2]\\\\n * [Adding reviewers][3]\\\\n * [Using a template for CR descriptions][4]\\\\n * [Revising a code review][5]\\\\n * [Using hooks][6]\\\\n\\\\n* [See also][7]\\\\nInitiating and responding to code reviews (CRs) is an important part of working with others at Amazon, whether or not they are on your team.\\\\nNote\\\\nYou should have a development system set up with the [CRUX][8] CLI. If you don’t, follow the instructions in [Getting Started][9] to set it up first.\\\\n## Initiate a code review using the CRUX CLI[¶][2]\\\\nOnce you have installed the CRUX CLI (**cr**) on your system, you can initiate a code review from the command line.\\\\nTo initiate a code review\\\\n1. Open a terminal window.\\\\n2. Go to the directory containing your changes to be reviewed (ex: `workplace/_my_workspace_name_/src/_my_package_name_`).\\\\n3. Use **git commit** to add and commit any changes you wish to have in your code review, but _do not push them_.\\\\nNote\\\\nIt’s helpful to keep changes submitted for code review _on their own branch_, to make it easy to modify your changes without having to merge any further changes on the mainline branch.\\\\n4. After committing your changes, type **cr** to begin. If you have multiple packages, you can use one of the [Package selection options][10] to include or exclude specific packages.\\\\n * CRUX will generate a URL like the following: `https://code.amazon.com/reviews/CR-_######_`:\\\\n\\\\n5. Click the generated link or copy/paste it into your browser.\\\\nNote\\\\nThis pane can be hidden by clicking its Hide button, and edited again by selecting the Edit Details button in the menu-bar.\\\\n * You’ll see a code review page that includes a diff-like view of your changes and a pane that shows the details of the code review (selected reviewers, notes, and so on).\\\\n\\\\n6. Select the reviewers for your code review.\\\\n * A number of suggested reviewers (based on those who have write access to the repository) will be provided so you can easily add them to the review.\\\\n * If the email alias represents a _team_, you can choose how many team members are required to approve your review before it is considered accepted.\\\\n\\\\n7. When you are ready to submit your review, select the Publish review button.\\\\n### Adding reviewers[¶][3]\\\\nBy default, your code review will be sent to the team that owns the package you’re editing. You can specify additional reviewers in two ways:\\\\n* [using the CRUX command-line][11] (while initiating the review)\\\\n* [using the CRUX web interface][12] (after initiating the review)\\\\nTo add reviewers using the CRUX command line\\\\n1. Initialize your code review with **cr**.\\\\n2. Add the `--reviewers` option.\\\\n3. Add the name of the reviewer (or LDAP group) and whether or not that reviewer is _required_ or _optional_.\\\\nA few common examples:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ncr --reviewers _alias_\\\\ncr --reviewers _alias_:_required|optional_\\\\ncr --reviewers _alias_:_1|0_\\\\ncr --reviewers _LDAP:alias_:_1|0_\\\\n```\\\\nTip\\\\nYou can find more information (and further examples) on the [CLI Reference][13].\\\\n * You can also use the values “1” and “0” to specify required/optional status, respectively.\\\\n * If the reviewer is a n LDAP group (a team alias), then you specify the _number_ of reviewers from that group that are required.\\\\n\\\\nTo add reviewers using the web interface\\\\n1. Open a web browser and navigate to your review, using the URL generated by CRUX when you initiated the commit.\\\\n2. Click the Details button to see the details of your commit, which includes a list of the Current Reviewers, Favorite Reviewers, and Suggested Reviewers.\\\\n3. Either type the email alias of the reviewer directly in the Add reviewer box beneath Current Reviewers, or choose additional reviewers from the Favorite Reviewers or Suggested Reviewers lists.\\\\n### Using a template for CR descriptions[¶][4]\\\\nCRUX supports using customized description templates when creating a CR. CR descriptions are pre-populated from a default template file called `.crux_template.md` (note the leading dot). Place a custom template file with the same name in the root of a package to override the default template. If a CR contains multiple packages with a custom template, then all the templates are included in the CR description and are separated by `Templatefor_PackageName_` section headers.\\\\nCustom template files can also be used on different branches of a package. For example, the mainline branch can contain a template with stricter testing guidelines than the template on a development branch. CRUX always uses whichever template file is found on the local git branch at the time that the CR is created.\\\\nTip\\\\nThe `.crux_template.md` file can be added to a package repository just like any other file. This allows changes to the template to be easily shared and tracked over time while maintaining a single per-package template standard.\\\\nThere are no strict requirements for the sections or contents in a description template. However, it is often helpful to include the commit message as part of a CR description. Simply add the `{{commit_message}}` macro to the template and CRUX automatically replaces it with the contents of a commit message when the CR is created. [CommonMark][14] can also be used in a description template to format the content as required.\\\\n### Revising a code review[¶][5]\\\\nThe steps to revise a code review are the same as [initiating the code review][15]. However, when you enter **cr** at the command prompt, the review is automatically updated. If the review is not found, then specify the review using the `--update-review` or `-r` option with the CR number of the review to update. For example, if the CR ID is `CR-1234567`, type:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ncr -r 1234567\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n### Using hooks[¶][6]\\\\nIf you need to run a tool before you create a CR, you can mechanize the tool invocation using hooks. **cr** checks for hooks in two locations.\\\\n* `~/.config/cr/hooks/pre-cr` (where ~ is the path to your home directory)\\\\n* `./pre-cr` (where . is the current directory)\\\\nAll arguments passed to **cr** are forwarded to hooks. When a hook terminates with a non-zero exit code, the CR creation is aborted.\\\\n## See also[¶][7]\\\\n* [CLI Reference][13]\\\\nNext page:[CLI Reference][13]Previous page:[Getting Started][9]\\\\n[1]: #using-the-cli\\\\n[2]: #initiate-a-code-review-using-the-crux-cli\\\\n[3]: #adding-reviewers\\\\n[4]: #using-a-template-for-cr-descriptions\\\\n[5]: #revising-a-code-review\\\\n[6]: #using-hooks\\\\n[7]: #see-also\\\\n[8]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/crux/index.html\\\\n[9]: ../getting-started/\\\\n[10]: ../command-cr/#cr-options-package-selection\\\\n[11]: #crux-add-reviewers-cmd\\\\n[12]: #crux-add-reviewers-web\\\\n[13]: ../reference/\\\\n[14]: https://commonmark.org/help/\\\\n[15]: #initiate-cr\\\"}}\"},{\"url\":\"https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/kiro/user-guide/howto-specs/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Kiro specs\",\"domain\":\"builder_hub\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1755820800000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":10,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\",\\\"relativeHrefsDescription\\\":\\\"Relative hrefs represent related documents that can be accessed by evaluating the relative path with respect to the input URL.

In your project, navigate to the directory containing your Coral model (`BT111_username_Model`) and open the `main.smithy` file in the `src/main/smithy` directory. This is where you’ll make updates to your data model.\\\\n2. Locate the definition for the `Beer` structure in the `main.smithy` file. It should look something like this:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nstructure Beer {\\\\n beerId: beerId\\\\n\\\\n @required\\\\n name: name\\\\n\\\\n description: description\\\\n\\\\n beerCompanyName: beerCompanyName\\\\n\\\\n beerTypeName: beerTypeName\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n3. Below the existing members, add the `priceInDollars` member:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nstructure Beer {\\\\n beerId: beerId\\\\n\\\\n @required\\\\n name: name\\\\n\\\\n description: description\\\\n\\\\n beerCompanyName: beerCompanyName\\\\n\\\\n beerTypeName: beerTypeName\\\\n\\\\n @required\\\\n @default(0)\\\\n priceInDollars: priceInDollars\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n@range(min:0)\\\\n@default(0)\\\\ninteger priceInDollars\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nImportant\\\\nRemember to save every time you edit a file if you don’t have autosave enabled in your IDE.\\\\n4. Next, implement the new member in your `BeerActivity.java` file so it appears in outputs. In `BT111_username_/src/main/java/com/amazon/bt111_username_/activity/BeerActivity.java`, add the following line:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nBeer beerWithAssignedId = new Beer.Builder()\\\\n .withBeerId(NEXT_BEER_ID.getAndIncrement())\\\\n .withName(inBeer.getName())\\\\n .withDescription(inBeer.getDescription())\\\\n .withBeerCompanyName(inBeer.getBeerCompanyName())\\\\n .withBeerTypeName(inBeer.getBeerTypeName())\\\\n .withPriceInDollars(inBeer.getPriceInDollars())\\\\n .build();\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n5. Now that you’ve updated the Smithy model, run:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-recursive-cmd --allPackages brazil-build\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nThis will trigger the build process to regenerate all the Coral artifacts based on the updated Smithy model.\\\\nNote\\\\nIf you notice that the `withPriceInDollars` and `getPriceInDollars` methods in your IDE are unresolved:\\\\n* IntelliJ: From the main menu, run Brazil ‣ Sync From Workspace (Enhanced) to resolve them.\\\\n* VS Code: From the main menu, select View ‣ Command Palette… Then search `bemol` and select Run bemol to resolve dependencies.\\\\n## Amazon Q Developer context commands[¶][4]\\\\nNow that you’ve made changes to your model, explore how to use Amazon Q Developer’s context commands to analyze your code more effectively. When chatting with it in your IDE, you can provide additional context like files and folders to get more tailored answers.\\\\nYou can provide context in two ways:\\\\n* **Explicitly** using `@` commands in the chat window.\\\\n* **Automatically** through pre-configured project settings.\\\\nAfter Amazon Q Developer generates an answer, it shows the files it used as context in a dropdown above the response.\\\\n### Explicit context with `@` commands[¶][5]\\\\nType `@` in the chat to access these context options:\\\\n* `@workspace` - Analyzes your entire project workspace (requires setup, covered in the next section)\\\\n* `@file` - References specific files for targeted analysis\\\\n* `@folder` - Includes entire directories in the context\\\\n* `@code` - References classes, functions, and variables from your project\\\\n* `@prompt` - Uses saved prompts as context (requires setup, covered later in this workshop)\\\\nIn this module, you’ll use `@workspace` to analyze all your BT111 project files when verifying the model changes.\\\\n#### Set up workspace context[¶][6]\\\\n1. Click Amazon Q at the bottom of your IDE.\\\\n2. Select Open Settings from the Amazon Q task bar that opens.\\\\n3. Click the box next to Workspace Index.\\\\n### Automatic context[¶][7]\\\\nAmazon Q Developer can automatically use context you’ve set up outside of chat:\\\\n* **Project rules** - Automatically applied rules you define for your project\\\\n* **Active file** - The currently open and visible file in your editor is automatically included as context\\\\n* **Customizations** - Repository-based context for enhanced suggestions (more information on customizations found [HERE][11])\\\\n#### Set up a project rule[¶][8]\\\\nProject rules can be used to assist with consistent code quality and style across your team. These rules are automatically applied to all Amazon Q Developer interactions within your project and provide context-aware suggestions that align with your coding standards. In this section, you’ll create a rule that enforces style and syntax standards for your Coral service.\\\\n1. In your IDE, open the Amazon Q chat panel.\\\\n2. In the input box, click the Rules button.\\\\n3. Select Create new rule.\\\\n4. In the dialog that appears, enter a name for your rule (e.g., `style`).\\\\nThis will create a Markdown file with that name in your project’s `_project-root_/.amazonq/rules` folder.\\\\n5. Add the following rule content in the editor:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nAll Java code in this Coral service must adhere to the following style guidelines:\\\\n\\\\n1. Use 4 spaces for indentation, never tabs.\\\\n2. Limit line length to 120 characters.\\\\n3. Lines should have no trailing spaces.\\\\n4. Include type hints (via Java Generics) for all method parameters and return values.\\\\n5. Imports should be organized into sections (standard library, third-party, local) and alphabetized.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n6. Save the file.\\\\nOnce saved, this rule will automatically influence Amazon Q Developer’s responses when you ask questions about your BT111 project.\\\\nTip\\\\nYou can copy and paste existing coding style documentation from your team or organization (such as Amazon’s internal coding standards) directly into project rules. This allows Amazon Q Developer to automatically follow your established conventions without needing to recreate them from scratch.\\\\n## Verify changes in the generated code[¶][9]\\\\nSince your build was completed successfully, you can inspect the generated code to confirm the new `priceInDollars` member was added. To verify that the code generation worked correctly, open a Amazon Q Developer chat window and ask:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n@workspace Search all generated classes and check each one for a priceInDollars field.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nThis will help you confirm that the new member was properly generated across all relevant files. You can also manually open the `Beer.java` file in your service package to confirm (use the search function in your IDE):\\\\n(`BT111_username_/build/private/gradle/generated/sources/annotationProcessor/java/main/com/amazon/bt111_username_/Beer.java`)\\\\nYou should see something like this:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nprotected int priceInDollars;\\\\n/**\\\\n* Sets the value of the field \\\\\\\"priceInDollars\\\\\\\" to be used for the constructed object.\\\\n* @param priceInDollars\\\\n* The value of the \\\\\\\"priceInDollars\\\\\\\" field.\\\\n* @return\\\\n* This builder.\\\\n*/\\\\npublic Builder withPriceInDollars(int priceInDollars) {\\\\n this.priceInDollars = priceInDollars;\\\\n return this;\\\\n}\\\\n/**\\\\n* Sets the fields of the given instances to the corresponding values recorded when calling the \\\\\\\"with\\\\\\\" methods.\\\\n* @param instance\\\\n* The instance to be populated.\\\\n*/\\\\nprotected void populate(Beer instance) {\\\\n instance.setBeerId(this.beerId);\\\\n instance.setName(this.name);\\\\n instance.setDescription(this.description);\\\\n instance.setBeerCompanyName(this.beerCompanyName);\\\\n instance.setBeerTypeName(this.beerTypeName);\\\\n instance.setPriceInDollars(this.priceInDollars);\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n## Test the updated model using the Coral Explorer[¶][10]\\\\n1. In the service package (`src/BT111_username_`), run the server with:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-build server\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n2. Navigate to `http://_cloud-desktop-hostname_:8080/explorer/index.html` and refresh the page. You may need to perform a hard refresh with cmd+shift+R (macOS) or ctrl+shift+R (Ubuntu or Windows).\\\\n3. Click the CreateBeer link on the left. You should now see the new `priceInDollars` member in the Request Data field.\\\\n4. Change the values of each member and click the Call CreateBeer button to see `priceInDollars` in the response.\\\\nGreat job adding a new member to your model.

Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with AmazonJavaFormat\\\\n# Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with AmazonJavaFormat[¶][1]\\\\n* [Configuration][2]\\\\n* [Usage][3]\\\\n * [Applying PeruGradleJavaPresets with Spotless][4]\\\\n * [Overriding the default Spotless and AmazonJavaFormat settings][5]\\\\n  * [Overriding the default Spotless settings][6]\\\\n  * [Overriding the default AmazonJavaFormat settings][7]\\\\n* [Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with other supported tools][8]\\\\nThis page provides instructions on how to use the [PeruGradleJavaPresets][9] plugin with [AmazonJavaFormat][10] utilizing [Spotless][11].\\\\nImportant\\\\nPlease read [Using code quality tools with PeruGradleJavaPresets][12] before reading this page. It has general instructions and prerequisites on using the PeruGradleJavaPresets plugin.\\\\n## Configuration[¶][2]\\\\nPeruGradleJavaPresets provides the following default settings for Spotless:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nspotless {\\\\n   encoding(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)\\\\n\\\\n   java {\\\\n      // excludes generated source files inside the build, target, generated and generated-src directories\\\\n      targetExclude(\\\\\\\"**/build/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/target/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/generated/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/generated-src/**\\\\\\\");\\\\n      // applies Amazon Java code style\\\\n      addStep(createAmazonJavaFormatStep(\\\\\\\"AMAZON\\\\\\\"))\\\\n\\\\n      // fixes annotations formatting for inline type annotations\\\\n      formatAnnotations()\\\\n      trimTrailingWhitespace()\\\\n      endWithNewline()\\\\n   }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n`isEnforceCheck` is set to `false` if the build is on the build fleet. Otherwise, it is set to `true`.\\\\nPeruGradleJavaPresets provides the following default settings for AmazonJavaFormat:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nformatter.code.style=AMAZON\\\\nformatter.apply.on.build=false\\\\nformatter.fail.on.diff=true\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n`formatter.fail.on.diff` is set to `false` if the build is on the build fleet. Otherwise, it is set to `true`.\\\\nYou can specify your own Spotless and AmazonJavaFormat settings. Refer to [Overriding the default Spotless and AmazonJavaFormat settings][13] for more information.\\\\n## Usage[¶][3]\\\\n### Applying PeruGradleJavaPresets with Spotless[¶][4]\\\\nIn the `plugins` block of your `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`, add the Spotless Gradle plugin along with the PeruGradleJavaPresets plugin:\\\\nGroovybuild.gradle[¶][14]\\\\n```\\\\nplugins {\\\\n   // ...\\\\n   // other plugins\\\\n   // ...\\\\n\\\\n   id 'com.diffplug.spotless' version '6.+'\\\\n   id 'software.amazon.peru.java-presets' version '1.0.+'\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nKotlinbuild.gradle.kts[¶][15]\\\\n```\\\\nplugins {\\\\n   // ...\\\\n   // other plugins\\\\n   // ...\\\\n\\\\n   id(\\\\\\\"com.diffplug.spotless\\\\\\\") version \\\\\\\"6.+\\\\\\\"\\\\n   id(\\\\\\\"software.amazon.peru.java-presets\\\\\\\") version \\\\\\\"1.0.+\\\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n### Overriding the default Spotless and AmazonJavaFormat settings[¶][5]\\\\nIf you want to use your own Spotless or AmazonJavaFormat settings, you can override some or all of the settings provided by the PeruGradleJavaPresets plugin.\\\\n#### Overriding the default Spotless settings[¶][6]\\\\nOverriding default Spotless settings by using the `spotless` block in `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`. For example:\\\\nGroovybuild.gradle[¶][16]\\\\n```\\\\nspotless {\\\\n   setEnforceCheck(true)\\\\n\\\\n   java {\\\\n      target(\\\\\\\"**/src/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/generated-src/**\\\\\\\")\\\\n      targetExclude(\\\\\\\"**/build/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/target/**\\\\\\\")\\\\n   }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nKotlinbuild.gradle.kts[¶][17]\\\\n```\\\\nspotless {\\\\n   isEnforceCheck = true\\\\n\\\\n   java {\\\\n      target(\\\\\\\"**/src/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/generated-src/**\\\\\\\")\\\\n      targetExclude(\\\\\\\"**/build/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/target/**\\\\\\\")\\\\n   }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nSee the [Spotless Gradle plugin Quickstart instructions][18] for more information.\\\\nNote\\\\nIf you only need default Spotless settings provided by PeruGradleJavaPresets, you do not need to modify `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`.\\\\n#### Overriding the default AmazonJavaFormat settings[¶][7]\\\\nOverride default AmazonJavaFormat settings by specifying some Gradle properties in a `gradle.properties` file under the `/project_root`. The following properties are available:\\\\n|Property name|Type|Description|Default value|\\\\n|---|---|---|---|\\\\n|`formatter.code.style`|Enum|Set the code style to use. One of `AMAZON`, `PALANTIR`, `GOOGLE`, `AOSP`.|`AMAZON`|\\\\n|`formatter.apply.on.build`|Boolean|Set if AmazonJavaFormat formats your code automatically when the `assemble` task runs.|`false`|\\\\n|`formatter.fail.on.diff`|Boolean|Set if the build fails when the code is not formatted properly. If you set the value to either `false` or `true` in the `gradle.properties` file, then it will be applied to both local and build fleet builds.|`false` if the build is on the build fleet. `true` if the build is not on the build fleet (local build).|\\\\n\\\\nFor example:\\\\ngradle.properties[¶][19]\\\\n```\\\\n// ...\\\\n// other properties\\\\n// ...\\\\n\\\\nformatter.code.style=GOOGLE\\\\nformatter.apply.on.build=true\\\\nformatter.fail.on.diff=true\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nNote\\\\nIf you only need default AmazonJavaFormat settings provided by PeruGradleJavaPresets, you do not need to modify `gradle.properties`.\\\\n## Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with other supported tools[¶][8]\\\\n* Instructions on using SpotBugs with PeruGradleJavaPresets configurations: [Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with SpotBugs][20]\\\\n* Instructions on using JaCoCo with PeruGradleJavaPresets configurations: [Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with JaCoCo][21]\\\\n* Instructions on using Checkstyle with PeruGradleJavaPresets configurations: [Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with Checkstyle][22]\\\\nNext page:[Vending code for Peru][23]Previous page:[Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with Checkstyle][22]\\\\n[1]: #using-perugradlejavapresets-with-amazonjavaformat\\\\n[2]: #configuration\\\\n[3]: #usage\\\\n[4]: #applying-perugradlejavapresets-with-spotless\\\\n[5]: #overriding-the-default-spotless-and-amazonjavaformat-settings\\\\n[6]: #overriding-the-default-spotless-settings\\\\n[7]: #overriding-the-default-amazonjavaformat-settings\\\\n[8]: #using-perugradlejavapresets-with-other-supported-tools\\\\n[9]: https://code.amazon.com/packages/PeruGradleJavaPresets\\\\n[10]: https://code.amazon.com/packages/AmazonJavaFormat\\\\n[11]: https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-gradle\\\\n[12]: ../howto-java-presets-gradle-plugin/\\\\n[13]: #overriding-default-spotless-and-amazonjavaformat-settings\\\\n[14]: #id3\\\\n[15]: #id4\\\\n[16]: #id5\\\\n[17]: #id6\\\\n[18]: https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/blob/main/plugin-gradle/README.md#quickstart\\\\n[19]: #id7\\\\n[20]: ../howto-java-presets-gradle-plugin-with-spotbugs/\\\\n[21]: ../howto-java-presets-gradle-plugin-with-jacoco/\\\\n[22]: ../howto-java-presets-gradle-plugin-with-checkstyle/\\\\n[23]: ../vending-code/\\\"}}\"},{\"url\":\"https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/crux/user-guide/howto-creating-review/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Creating a code review\",\"domain\":\"builder_hub\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1755820800000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":4,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\",\\\"relativeHrefsDescription\\\":\\\"Relative hrefs represent related documents that can be accessed by evaluating the relative path with respect to the input URL.

Creating a code review\\\\n# Creating a code review[¶][1]\\\\n* [General procedure][2]\\\\n* [Creating a review for an arbitrary diff][3]\\\\n* [See also][4]\\\\nCode reviews are created using the [CRUX CLI][5]. You can create code reviews for any packages in a [Brazil workspace][6]. However, avoid creating reviews across multiple Brazil workspaces, which can cause issues. Code reviews can also be created for any GitFarm repositories that are located on your host.\\\\nNote\\\\nCRUX is only available for [GitFarm][7] and is not supported with any other source code management system.\\\\n## General procedure[¶][2]\\\\nTo create a new code review (CR) with CRUX:\\\\n1. Run the **cr** command from the git root where a code change is committed and follow the output link. If you have more than one package in your workspace that you’d like to have in the same review, then run **cr** from the `src` directory and use the `--include` option to add each package individually, or the `--all` option to include any package with un-pushed commits.\\\\n![../_images/crux-1-create.png][8]\\\\n2. On the code review page, enter a summary and notes for the reviewers. Use [CommonMark][9] to format the content and modify the description as required.\\\\n3. Individual commits and their descriptions are listed at Commits tab.\\\\n4. Reviewers can be added in the Reviewers tab. You can add individual users, LDAP/POSIX groups, and Teams. When you publish this code review everyone listed here will be emailed. To notify a mailing list, use a Team with that list associated with it. Otherwise all group members will be included individually.\\\\n5. Names of people, teams, and groups will be autocompleted. Click a name or highlight it and press Enter to add that person or group to the review. Autocomplete searches for teams/groups by name and people by name, login, and role and is case-insensitive. Groups auto-generated from Teams will only show the Team.\\\\n6. If you need to edit the summary or notes, access the Details tab and click on Actions ‣ Edit Details. Both summary and description will be available for update.\\\\n7. Once you are satisfied with your summary, notes, and reviewers you can click outside of this dialog to go straight to the diff.\\\\n8. Clicking Publish Review will send notifications to all of the reviewers so they can come see it and leave comments.\\\\n## Creating a review for an arbitrary diff[¶][3]\\\\nArbitrary diff code reviews are now supported.\\\\nAt the moment you can create a code review for any diff compliant to any of these formats:\\\\n* [Unified format][10]\\\\n* [Git patch format][11]\\\\nFor more information please refer to the [blog post][12].\\\\nIf you are using the **diff** tool, you must specify the number of lines of unified context. To get the full context (required by CRUX) specify a number greater than the number of lines in your file.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ndiff -U 1000 current.sql proposed.sql | cr --arbitrary-diff-create-personal-pkg -a -\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n## See also[¶][4]\\\\n* [Publishing revisions][13]\\\\nNext page:[Publishing revisions][13]Previous page:[Using CRUX][14]\\\\n[1]: #creating-a-code-review\\\\n[2]: #general-procedure\\\\n[3]: #creating-a-review-for-an-arbitrary-diff\\\\n[4]: #see-also\\\\n[5]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/crux/cli-guide/getting-started.html\\\\n[6]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/brazil/user-guide/concepts-workspace.html\\\\n[7]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/gitfarm/index.html\\\\n[8]: ../_images/crux-1-create.png\\\\n[9]: https://commonmark.org/help/\\\\n[10]: http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Detailed-Unified.html#Detailed%20Unified\\\\n[11]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff#_generating_patches_with_p\\\\n[12]: https://builderhub.corp.amazon.com/blog/arbitrary-diff-support-for-crux-is-now-available\\\\n[13]: ../howto-publishing-revision/\\\\n[14]: ../howto/\\\"}}\"},{\"url\":\"https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/coverlay/user-guide/concept-safeguard/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Understanding Safeguard\",\"domain\":\"builder_hub\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1755820800000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":5,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"etadata APIs) are excluded.\\\\n* **Languages without coverage frameworks** - Changes made to code with no coverage data are implicitly excluded. A change is considered to have coverage data if the _coverage gutter_ on the code review has coverage states marked. Shell scripts, configuration files, etc. typically do not have coverage data.\\\\n* **Test packages** - Packages which solely contain integration test code, load generators or canaries are excluded.\\\\n* **Infra-as-code** - Packages which configure application definitions (LPT, CDK) are excluded.\\\\n#### New line[¶][9]\\\\nLines of code that are added or modified as part of the changes-under-review.\\\\n#### New line coverage[¶][10]\\\\nEnforces the percentage of lines covered, but only for lines which were added or modified by the CR. This allows teams whose packages have low coverage to incrementally improve the line coverage over time. This check is also configured as an integer value between 0 and 100. If the value is set to 0, Coverlay ignores the package new line coverage percent, but still reports it through a comment on your code review.\\\\nNew line coverage is always calculated as the number of covered, modified and executable lines of code divided by the total, modified and executable lines of code—no matter the total count. Thus, if you submit a code review with 4 executable lines modified, at least 3 should be covered to reach 70% new line coverage rule applied by safeguard. If you submit a code review with 3 or fewer lines of code, all of them should be covered.\\\\n#### Coverage framework[¶][11]\\\\nA tool package owners configure to run during build that collects data on which code segments are executed while running the package’s unit tests; this is usually accomplished through markers instrumented into the source code. An example of this is the JaCoCo coverage framework included by default in HappierTrails.\\\\n#### Coverable[¶][12]\\\\nAn adjective describing that the given code segment is not considered executable by unit tests. Coverlay infers this from the presence of indexed Covered/Uncovered states in your coverage framework’s report. _Thus, any lines of code without coverage data labels are ignored by safeguard’s checks._\\\\n#### Critical change[¶][13]\\\\nChanges that are likely to change the functionality of the program and could introduce risks. These changes should be unit tested to make sure the code behaves as expected without introducing unexpected errors.\\\\n#### Non-critical change[¶][14]\\\\nUnlike critical changes, some code changes are low-risk and do not require unit tests. These changes will not change the functionality of the program or are not important to test. Currently, Safeguard is recognizing some non-functional or low-risk changes as non-critical changes, and the rest as critical changes. We are progressively detecting more non-critical changes. To understand the current scope of non-critical change, please check [non-critical change scope][26].\\\\n## Safeguard decision-making process[¶][15]\\\\nSafeguard only checks coverage for [new lines][4] (newly added or modified) of code that are coverable. If the unit test coverage for those lines of code passes the threshold set in your organization’s policy (**70%** for now), the code under review will pass Safeguard check. As such, its PASSED /FAILED /SKIPPED /WARNING status will display in your existing Coverlay report comment.\\\\nCode reviews that meet ALL of the following criteria will receive Coverlay approval failures:\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> * The changed packages are deployed to a production-impacting pipeline.\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> * The new line coverage for one or more package changes in the code review is below 70%.\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> * The changed packages are expected to contain unit tests.\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> However, these failures can be bypassed if the code changes in the code review are meant for testing feature changes or promoting prototype changes to pre-prod stages by using a [feature branch][7].\\\\n### Filter out non-critical changes from coverage check[¶][16]\\\\nThe Coverlay team will start from filtering out non-functional changes. Developers occasionally re-format legacy code-bases as part of adopting checkstyle or other team-based standards for styling. In the code review for these changes, any reformatted code that was previously un-tested code will be flagged as uncovered new lines. The change author is not likely to have sufficient context or bandwidth to add unit tests for these sections of code, and the changes should not cause any behavioral difference as they do not modify the syntax tree of the changed source files. Safeguard now filters these changes out from coverage check as they are viewed as non-critical change and exclude them from coverage check. Unit testing is still recommended for these changes. When deciding the total number of lines that are important to be tested, Safeguard will filter out those lines of code that are recognized as non-critical.\\\\n**critical change** - changes that are likely to change the functionality of the program and could introduce risks. These changes should be unit tested to make sure the code behaves as expected without introducing unexpected errors\\\\n**non-critical change** - unlike critical changes, some code changes are low-risk and do no require unit tests. These changes will not change the functionality of the program or are not important to test. Currently, Safeguard is recognizing some non-functional or low-risk changes as non-critical changes, and the rest as critical changes.\\\\n**non-critical uncovered lines** - Safeguard does not enforce unit test coverage on lines of code that are recognized as non-critical changes. If a non-critical line of code change is uncovered, Safeguard check will not be affected. Unit testing is still encouraged for non-critical changes.\\\\n#### Non-critical change scope[¶][17]\\\\nThe first release focuses on reformatting of existing code and in-line comment edits/additions first. Here are some examples of non-critical changes to filter out.\\\\n* **Reformatting changes** - Formatting changes do not affect code logic. Common format changes include changing the order for methods, adding or deleting lines or white space, wrapping a line when it is too long, and etc. If we parse the code into a tree by viewing each object as a tree node and each operation as a branch and ignoring any white space, reformatting change does not change the layout of the parsed tree.\\\\nAn isolated reformatting change is shown in the following image:\\\\n![A screenshot showing example of an isolated reformatting change.][27]If the change includes a mix of reformatting and functional change, it will not be filtered out.\\\\n* **In-line comment edits/additions** - Code comments help with code maintenance and finding bugs, but do not affect the software behavior.\\\\n![A screenshot showing example of in-line comment edits/addition.][28]\\\\n* **Log statements** - Logs that helps to investigate and monitor the service, but do not affect the software behavior. Log statements that contain complicated method calls are not categorized as low-risk, as complicated method calls are more likely to result in unexpected operational changes.\\\\nAn example low-risk log statement:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nlog.info(\\\\\\\"Starting operation \\\\\\\" + getOperationName());\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n* **Print statements** - Print statements that helps to investigate and monitor the service, but do not affect the software behavior. Print statements that contain complicated method calls are not categorized as low-risk, as complicated method calls are more likely to result in unexpected operational changes.\\\\nAn example low-risk print statement:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nSystem.out.println(\\\\\\\"Retrieved following message from queue: \\\\\\\" + getMessage());\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n* **Metrics statements** - Metrics that helps to investigate and monitor the service, but do not affect the software behavior. Metrics statements that contain complicated method calls are not categorized as low-risk, as they are more likely to cause errors and unexpected operational changes.\\\\nAn example low-risk log statement:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nmyCustomizedMetric.addCount(\\\\\\\"Success\\\\\\\", hasSucceeded);\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n* **Enum classes/objects** - An enum type is a special data type that enables a\"},{\"url\":\"https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/learning/bt101-make-code-change/\",\"displayTitle\":\"BT101: Make a code change\",\"domain\":\"builder_hub\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1755820800000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":6,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"ependencies (bemol --verbose) from the command palette.\\\\n## Explore your project with Amazon Q Developer[¶][4]\\\\nNow that you have your workspace open in VS Code, use Amazon Q Developer to help you understand the project structure and codebase.\\\\n1. In VS Code, click the Amazon Q icon in the activity bar on the left side of the window to open the chat panel.\\\\n![\\\\\\\"Amazon Q icon in VS Code\\\\\\\"][34]\\\\n2. In the Amazon Q chat panel, type a prompt asking Q to explain the project structure. For example:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nCan you explain the structure of this project and what the calculator service does?\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nOr:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nExplain the project within this workspace.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n3. Review Amazon Q Developer’s response, which should provide an overview of:\\\\nNote\\\\nAmazon Q Developer analyzes your workspace in real-time to provide contextual information about your code. It can help you understand unfamiliar codebases quickly, which is especially valuable when you’re joining a new team or working with a new service.\\\\n * The overall project structure.\\\\n * The purpose of the calculator service.\\\\n * The key files and their functions.\\\\n * How the code is organized.\\\\n\\\\n4. You can ask follow-up questions to get more specific information about parts of the code you’re interested in. For example:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nWhat does the Calculator.java file do?\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nOr:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nHow are the unit tests structured in this project?\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nNote\\\\nFor guidance on creating effective prompts with Amazon Q Developer, check out the [Prompt Engineering with Amazon Q Developer][35] course.\\\\n5. Take a few minutes to explore the project with Amazon Q Developer before moving on to the next section.\\\\n## Make code changes[¶][5]\\\\nNext, you’ll make a code change. You’ve been assigned your first user story after joining your team, and it looks like you’ll be implementing the functionality of one of your service’s functions. The user story says that the subtraction function needs to be completed, and it mentions that unit tests have already been implemented for the function but are disabled. You should be sure to enable them after implementing the function.\\\\nNote\\\\nFor this training, you’ll use the project view and integrated terminal in the IDE that you installed during the [Developer Environment Setup][36] process. If you have not installed your [IDE and plugins][29], do so now.\\\\n1. Open your `BT101` project folder in your IDE.\\\\n2. Open the file where the code for your lambda function is:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nsrc/com/amazon/bt101_username_/lambda/calculator/Calculator.java\\\\n```\\\\n3. Use Amazon Q Developer’s Fix feature to implement the subtract function:\\\\n 1. With the `Calculator.java` file open, locate the developer’s comment that mentions reusing the add function.\\\\n 2. Highlight the entire `TODO` comment.\\\\n 3. Right-click on the highlighted text and select Amazon Q: Fix from the context menu.\\\\n 4. Amazon Q Developer will automatically generate an implementation for the subtract function based on the highlighted comment and produce a link to a file diff in the chat output. Review the suggested implementation and verify that it:\\\\n * Reuses the add function as mentioned in the comment.\\\\n * Includes appropriate logging statements.\\\\n * Returns the correct result.\\\\n4. Save your changes if you don’t have auto-save enabled in your IDE.\\\\n## Build your changes[¶][6]\\\\n1. To see if your packages build successfully, first go to your package root directory (unless you’re already there):\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ncd ~/workplace/BT101/src/BT101_Username_\\\\n```\\\\n2. Make sure the package will build by using **brazil-build**:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-build\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nImportant\\\\n_If your build fails_, your pipeline may not have finished building the version set. Open up the browser window where you had your pipeline open, or go to https://pipelines.amazon.com and open your BT101 pipeline, and make sure that the status of the VersionSet stage is Succeeded. If it is not, wait for it to finish and then re-run the `brazilworkspacesync` command in the previous step before building. If your build has failed and you verified that your pipeline finished building the version set, you may have an issue with CheckStyle.\\\\n_CheckStyle_ is a source code analyzer used by many teams at Amazon to ensure that code adheres to a coding standard. Standards are set at the team level and any code that does not meet that standard will fail to build.\\\\nCheck the build failure output, and look for the word `CheckStyle`. If you find it, the issue you are facing is likely due to a copy/paste action inserting a tab instead of spaces.\\\\nFind the line number referenced in the build failure. In the referenced line, locate any tab characters and _replace them with spaces_ before running your build command again.\\\\n3. After the build completes successfully, use Amazon Q Developer to learn more about what the **brazil-build** command does:\\\\n 1. Open the Amazon Q panel if it’s not already open.\\\\n 2. Ask Amazon Q Developer to explain the **brazil-build** command by typing a prompt like:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nExplain what the brazil-build command does and what happened during my build process.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n 3. Review Amazon Q Developer’s explanation of the build process.\\\\n\\\\n### Meet a \\\\\\\\(temporary\\\\\\\\) teammate![¶][7]\\\\nIf you’re taking this course online, then ask your onboarding buddy, manager, or someone else on your team to be your “teammate” for the purposes of this activity—they’ll help review your code shortly. They must _also_ have the necessary [development prerequisites][37] to help, however!\\\\nYou can also find a reviewer in the [#sb-onboarding-code-review-requests][38] Slack channel.\\\\n## Create unit tests[¶][8]\\\\nYour teammate had left a comment that the unit tests for the subtract function need to be created. You’ll use Amazon Q Developer to help you create these tests.\\\\n1. Go to your package’s directory now if you’re not already there:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ncd ~/workplace/BT101/src/BT101_Username_\\\\n```\\\\n2. While code is kept in the `src` folder, unit tests are stored in the `tst` folder. Open the file with the unit tests:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ntst/com/amazon/bt101_username_/lambda/calculator/CalculatorTest.java\\\\n```\\\\nTip\\\\nUse tab autocomplete again.\\\\n3. Use Amazon Q Developer to create two new unit tests for the subtract function:\\\\n 1. With the `CalculatorTest.java` file open, click the Amazon Q icon in the activity bar on the left.\\\\n 2. Ask Amazon Q Developer to create two unit tests for the subtract function by typing a prompt like:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nCreate two unit tests for the subtract function in this file: one for a happy path case and one for a bad request case.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n 3. Review the suggested unit tests from Amazon Q Developer and make sure they:\\\\n * Follow the same pattern as the existing tests.\\\\n * Include a happy path test that verifies correct subtraction.\\\\n * Include a bad request test that verifies error handling.\\\\n * Use appropriate assertions and logging.\\\\n\\\\n 4. Make any necessary adjustments to match the coding style of the existing tests.\\\\n\\\\n4. Save your changes.\\\\n5. Make sure the package will still build, and this time run the unit tests as well. The `brazil-buildrelease` command will build your package, run all unit tests, and perform style checks. You can run `brazil-build` just to build your package or `brazil-buildtest` to build and test your package, but for now you’ll run everything.

Running idiomatic coordinate campaigns\\\\n# Running idiomatic coordinate campaigns[¶][2]\\\\nNote\\\\nIdiomatic coordinate campaigns can only be created by members of the security team. If you are not a member of the security team and need assistance creating an idiomatic coordinate campaign, [cut a SIM ticket][3] and the SAS oncall will help create the campaign.\\\\n**Idiomatic Packages \\\\\\\\(IP\\\\\\\\)** are packages in industry-standard package managers like Maven or NPM. They exist in parallel with Brazil packages: an idiomatic package might contain the same software as a Brazil package, but Brazil has its own way of expressing dependencies between packages. Each idiomatic package manager uses _versions_ to distinguish package contents over time. These versions often follow a major.minor.patch convention. An **Idiomatic Package Version \\\\\\\\(IPV\\\\\\\\)** is a `{package,version}` tuple.\\\\nIdiomatic packages and package versions are **Idiomatic Coordinates**. SAS understands idiomatic coordinates in campaign definitions; third-party software maps easily to those coordinates, and SAS can apply those coordinates uniformly across package managers.\\\\nDuring builds that use Peru, idiomatic packages that are pulled in from CodeArtifact repositories are called as **CodeArtifact Package Versions \\\\\\\\(CAPV\\\\\\\\)** and packages in their native format will be referred to as **Idiomatic Package Versions \\\\\\\\(IPV\\\\\\\\)**.\\\\nUse the following guidelines when running idiomatic coordinate campaigns:\\\\n* If you are a member of a security team and have been approved as a super user, you can create a campaign on any idiomatic coordinate. For idiomatic coordinates, SAS supports campaign creation for the types IPV and CAPV.\\\\nNote\\\\nSAS currently only supports creating idiomatic coordinate campaigns for Peru version sets.\\\\n* The correct format for CodeArtifact package versions are as follows:\\\\nMaven CAPV format:\\\\n_PackageType:Namespace:PackageName:Version_\\\\nFor example, `maven:software.amazon.awssdk:core:2.16.52`\\\\nNPM: CAPV format:\\\\n_PackageType:PackageName:Version_\\\\nFor example, `npm:ansi-red:0.1.1`\\\\n* The correct IPV format differs for each package manager. Every package manager has a package type and version but it can also have some additional attributes specific to that package manager. So the following format is used:\\\\n_type:version:key1:value1:key2:value2…._\\\\nIPV examples for Maven:\\\\n`maven:1.1.13:artifact_id:coral-buffer:group_id:com.amazon.coral`\\\\nIPV examples for NPM:\\\\n`npm:4.5.1:name:@amzn/aws-cdk-isengard`\\\\nWhen creating a campaign, you can specify multiple packages separated by commas. Target software is evaluated as a Boolean OR (e.g. target entities containing `maven:com.google.code.gson:gsonORnpm:ansi-red:0.1.1`). Automated Software Update mode cannot be enabled for idiomatic coordinates targets at this time.\\\\n* SUS campaign criteria does not support `AND` / `SET` operations for idiomatic campaigns. Only `Union` / `OR` operations between idiomatic coordinates for an idiomatic campaign are allowed.\\\\nNext page:[Running ticketing campaigns][4]Previous page:[Running GitFarm campaigns][5]\\\\n[1]: ../sas-logo-72px.png\\\\n[2]: #running-idiomatic-coordinate-campaigns\\\\n[3]: https://tiny.amazon.com/uu2cj7ga\\\\n[4]: ../campaigns-ticketing/\\\\n[5]: ../campaigns-gitfarm/\\\"}}\"},{\"url\":\"https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/bats/user-guide/bars-manifest/\",\"displayTitle\":\"BARS Manifest File\",\"domain\":\"builder_hub\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1755820800000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":8,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"n-reaction-user-guide/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/smithy/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/smithy/user-guide/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/smithy/languages/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/smithy/reference/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/sas/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/sas/user-guide/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/sas/api-guide/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/tim/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/tim/user-guide/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/tod/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/tod/user-guide/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/tps-generator/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/tps-generator/user-guide/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/transmogrifier/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/transmogrifier/user-guide/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/transmogrifier/api-guide/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/trebuchet/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/universal-constructs/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/universal-constructs/user-guide/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/viceroy/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/wasabi/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/wasabi/user-guide/index.html\\\",\\\"../../../../docs/tools/products-wac/index.html\\\",\\\"../python-default/\\\",\\\"../preserving-symlinks/\\\"],\\\"mainContent\\\":\\\"# BARS Manifest File\\\\n# BARS Manifest File[¶][1]\\\\nThe BARS manifest is used to record all artifacts pushed by the BATS system as part of the Packaging stage inside a pipeline.

This will result in an automatic `version` bump of the manifest file.\\\\n* Any other type of change is non-breaking, and will not result in a `version` bump.\\\\nFor example, support for a new type of artifact `ami` is added and recorded inside the `bars-manifest.json` file under the `amis` field:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\n \\\\\\\"version\\\\\\\": 4,\\\\n \\\\\\\"amis\\\\\\\": [\\\\n {\\\\n \\\\\\\"ami_field_1\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"ami_value_1\\\\\\\"\\\\n }\\\\n ]\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nThis change is not considered to be breaking.\\\\nAlternatively, if multi-requester support is added to a BATS transform, the requester section of the manifest is now expected to be a list:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\n \\\\\\\"version\\\\\\\": 5,\\\\n \\\\\\\"requester\\\\\\\": [\\\\n {\\\\n \\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"5447973\\\\\\\",\\\\n \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Pipeline\\\\\\\",\\\\n \\\\\\\"service\\\\\\\": null\\\\n },\\\\n {\\\\n \\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"5447974\\\\\\\",\\\\n \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Pipeline\\\\\\\",\\\\n \\\\\\\"service\\\\\\\": null\\\\n }\\\\n ]\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nThis type of change will be considered to be breaking.\\\\nNon-breaking change will be made in a silent fashion, where the change is rolled out along regular CICD without explicit process and notifications. Breaking change will be managed via a more visible release process.

Using the CLI\\\\n# Using the CLI[¶][1]\\\\n* [Initiate a code review using the CRUX CLI][2]\\\\n * [Adding reviewers][3]\\\\n * [Using a template for CR descriptions][4]\\\\n * [Revising a code review][5]\\\\n * [Using hooks][6]\\\\n\\\\n* [See also][7]\\\\nInitiating and responding to code reviews (CRs) is an important part of working with others at Amazon, whether or not they are on your team.\\\\nNote\\\\nYou should have a development system set up with the [CRUX][8] CLI. If you don’t, follow the instructions in [Getting Started][9] to set it up first.\\\\n## Initiate a code review using the CRUX CLI[¶][2]\\\\nOnce you have installed the CRUX CLI (**cr**) on your system, you can initiate a code review from the command line.\\\\nTo initiate a code review\\\\n1. Open a terminal window.\\\\n2. Go to the directory containing your changes to be reviewed (ex: `workplace/_my_workspace_name_/src/_my_package_name_`).\\\\n3. Use **git commit** to add and commit any changes you wish to have in your code review, but _do not push them_.\\\\nNote\\\\nIt’s helpful to keep changes submitted for code review _on their own branch_, to make it easy to modify your changes without having to merge any further changes on the mainline branch.\\\\n4. After committing your changes, type **cr** to begin. If you have multiple packages, you can use one of the [Package selection options][10] to include or exclude specific packages.\\\\n * CRUX will generate a URL like the following: `https://code.amazon.com/reviews/CR-_######_`:\\\\n\\\\n5. Click the generated link or copy/paste it into your browser.\\\\nNote\\\\nThis pane can be hidden by clicking its Hide button, and edited again by selecting the Edit Details button in the menu-bar.\\\\n * You’ll see a code review page that includes a diff-like view of your changes and a pane that shows the details of the code review (selected reviewers, notes, and so on).\\\\n\\\\n6. Select the reviewers for your code review.\\\\n * A number of suggested reviewers (based on those who have write access to the repository) will be provided so you can easily add them to the review.\\\\n * If the email alias represents a _team_, you can choose how many team members are required to approve your review before it is considered accepted.\\\\n\\\\n7. When you are ready to submit your review, select the Publish review button.\\\\n### Adding reviewers[¶][3]\\\\nBy default, your code review will be sent to the team that owns the package you’re editing. You can specify additional reviewers in two ways:\\\\n* [using the CRUX command-line][11] (while initiating the review)\\\\n* [using the CRUX web interface][12] (after initiating the review)\\\\nTo add reviewers using the CRUX command line\\\\n1. Initialize your code review with **cr**.\\\\n2. Add the `--reviewers` option.\\\\n3. Add the name of the reviewer (or LDAP group) and whether or not that reviewer is _required_ or _optional_.\\\\nA few common examples:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ncr --reviewers _alias_\\\\ncr --reviewers _alias_:_required|optional_\\\\ncr --reviewers _alias_:_1|0_\\\\ncr --reviewers _LDAP:alias_:_1|0_\\\\n```\\\\nTip\\\\nYou can find more information (and further examples) on the [CLI Reference][13].\\\\n * You can also use the values “1” and “0” to specify required/optional status, respectively.\\\\n * If the reviewer is a n LDAP group (a team alias), then you specify the _number_ of reviewers from that group that are required.\\\\n\\\\nTo add reviewers using the web interface\\\\n1. Open a web browser and navigate to your review, using the URL generated by CRUX when you initiated the commit.\\\\n2. Click the Details button to see the details of your commit, which includes a list of the Current Reviewers, Favorite Reviewers, and Suggested Reviewers.\\\\n3. Either type the email alias of the reviewer directly in the Add reviewer box beneath Current Reviewers, or choose additional reviewers from the Favorite Reviewers or Suggested Reviewers lists.\\\\n### Using a template for CR descriptions[¶][4]\\\\nCRUX supports using customized description templates when creating a CR. CR descriptions are pre-populated from a default template file called `.crux_template.md` (note the leading dot). Place a custom template file with the same name in the root of a package to override the default template. If a CR contains multiple packages with a custom template, then all the templates are included in the CR description and are separated by `Templatefor_PackageName_` section headers.\\\\nCustom template files can also be used on different branches of a package. For example, the mainline branch can contain a template with stricter testing guidelines than the template on a development branch. CRUX always uses whichever template file is found on the local git branch at the time that the CR is created.\\\\nTip\\\\nThe `.crux_template.md` file can be added to a package repository just like any other file. This allows changes to the template to be easily shared and tracked over time while maintaining a single per-package template standard.\\\\nThere are no strict requirements for the sections or contents in a description template. However, it is often helpful to include the commit message as part of a CR description. Simply add the `{{commit_message}}` macro to the template and CRUX automatically replaces it with the contents of a commit message when the CR is created. [CommonMark][14] can also be used in a description template to format the content as required.\\\\n### Revising a code review[¶][5]\\\\nThe steps to revise a code review are the same as [initiating the code review][15]. However, when you enter **cr** at the command prompt, the review is automatically updated. If the review is not found, then specify the review using the `--update-review` or `-r` option with the CR number of the review to update. For example, if the CR ID is `CR-1234567`, type:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ncr -r 1234567\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n### Using hooks[¶][6]\\\\nIf you need to run a tool before you create a CR, you can mechanize the tool invocation using hooks. **cr** checks for hooks in two locations.\\\\n* `~/.config/cr/hooks/pre-cr` (where ~ is the path to your home directory)\\\\n* `./pre-cr` (where . is the current directory)\\\\nAll arguments passed to **cr** are forwarded to hooks. When a hook terminates with a non-zero exit code, the CR creation is aborted.\\\\n## See also[¶][7]\\\\n* [CLI Reference][13]\\\\nNext page:[CLI Reference][13]Previous page:[Getting Started][9]\\\\n[1]: #using-the-cli\\\\n[2]: #initiate-a-code-review-using-the-crux-cli\\\\n[3]: #adding-reviewers\\\\n[4]: #using-a-template-for-cr-descriptions\\\\n[5]: #revising-a-code-review\\\\n[6]: #using-hooks\\\\n[7]: #see-also\\\\n[8]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/crux/index.html\\\\n[9]: ../getting-started/\\\\n[10]: ../command-cr/#cr-options-package-selection\\\\n[11]: #crux-add-reviewers-cmd\\\\n[12]: #crux-add-reviewers-web\\\\n[13]: ../reference/\\\\n[14]: https://commonmark.org/help/\\\\n[15]: #initiate-cr\\\"}}\"},{\"url\":\"https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/kiro/user-guide/howto-specs/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Kiro specs\",\"domain\":\"builder_hub\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1755820800000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":10,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\",\\\"relativeHrefsDescription\\\":\\\"Relative hrefs represent related documents that can be accessed by evaluating the relative path with respect to the input URL.

Now that you’ve updated the Smithy model, run:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-recursive-cmd --allPackages brazil-build\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nThis will trigger the build process to regenerate all the Coral artifacts based on the updated Smithy model.\\\\nNote\\\\nIf you notice that the `withPriceInDollars` and `getPriceInDollars` methods in your IDE are unresolved:\\\\n* IntelliJ: From the main menu, run Brazil ‣ Sync From Workspace (Enhanced) to resolve them.\\\\n* VS Code: From the main menu, select View ‣ Command Palette… Then search `bemol` and select Run bemol to resolve dependencies.\\\\n## Amazon Q Developer context commands[¶][4]\\\\nNow that you’ve made changes to your model, explore how to use Amazon Q Developer’s context commands to analyze your code more effectively. When chatting with it in your IDE, you can provide additional context like files and folders to get more tailored answers.\\\\nYou can provide context in two ways:\\\\n* **Explicitly** using `@` commands in the chat window.\\\\n* **Automatically** through pre-configured project settings.\\\\nAfter Amazon Q Developer generates an answer, it shows the files it used as context in a dropdown above the response.\\\\n### Explicit context with `@` commands[¶][5]\\\\nType `@` in the chat to access these context options:\\\\n* `@workspace` - Analyzes your entire project workspace (requires setup, covered in the next section)\\\\n* `@file` - References specific files for targeted analysis\\\\n* `@folder` - Includes entire directories in the context\\\\n* `@code` - References classes, functions, and variables from your project\\\\n* `@prompt` - Uses saved prompts as context (requires setup, covered later in this workshop)\\\\nIn this module, you’ll use `@workspace` to analyze all your BT111 project files when verifying the model changes.\\\\n#### Set up workspace context[¶][6]\\\\n1. Click Amazon Q at the bottom of your IDE.\\\\n2. Select Open Settings from the Amazon Q task bar that opens.\\\\n3. Click the box next to Workspace Index.\\\\n### Automatic context[¶][7]\\\\nAmazon Q Developer can automatically use context you’ve set up outside of chat:\\\\n* **Project rules** - Automatically applied rules you define for your project\\\\n* **Active file** - The currently open and visible file in your editor is automatically included as context\\\\n* **Customizations** - Repository-based context for enhanced suggestions (more information on customizations found [HERE][11])\\\\n#### Set up a project rule[¶][8]\\\\nProject rules can be used to assist with consistent code quality and style across your team. These rules are automatically applied to all Amazon Q Developer interactions within your project and provide context-aware suggestions that align with your coding standards. In this section, you’ll create a rule that enforces style and syntax standards for your Coral service.\\\\n1. In your IDE, open the Amazon Q chat panel.\\\\n2. In the input box, click the Rules button.\\\\n3. Select Create new rule.\\\\n4. In the dialog that appears, enter a name for your rule (e.g., `style`).\\\\nThis will create a Markdown file with that name in your project’s `_project-root_/.amazonq/rules` folder.\\\\n5. Add the following rule content in the editor:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nAll Java code in this Coral service must adhere to the following style guidelines:\\\\n\\\\n1. Use 4 spaces for indentation, never tabs.\\\\n2. Limit line length to 120 characters.\\\\n3. Lines should have no trailing spaces.\\\\n4. Include type hints (via Java Generics) for all method parameters and return values.\\\\n5. Imports should be organized into sections (standard library, third-party, local) and alphabetized.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n6. Save the file.\\\\nOnce saved, this rule will automatically influence Amazon Q Developer’s responses when you ask questions about your BT111 project.\\\\nTip\\\\nYou can copy and paste existing coding style documentation from your team or organization (such as Amazon’s internal coding standards) directly into project rules. This allows Amazon Q Developer to automatically follow your established conventions without needing to recreate them from scratch.\\\\n## Verify changes in the generated code[¶][9]\\\\nSince your build was completed successfully, you can inspect the generated code to confirm the new `priceInDollars` member was added. To verify that the code generation worked correctly, open a Amazon Q Developer chat window and ask:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n@workspace Search all generated classes and check each one for a priceInDollars field.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nThis will help you confirm that the new member was properly generated across all relevant files. You can also manually open the `Beer.java` file in your service package to confirm (use the search function in your IDE):\\\\n(`BT111_username_/build/private/gradle/generated/sources/annotationProcessor/java/main/com/amazon/bt111_username_/Beer.java`)\\\\nYou should see something like this:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nprotected int priceInDollars;\\\\n/**\\\\n* Sets the value of the field \\\\\\\"priceInDollars\\\\\\\" to be used for the constructed object.\\\\n* @param priceInDollars\\\\n* The value of the \\\\\\\"priceInDollars\\\\\\\" field.\\\\n* @return\\\\n* This builder.\\\\n*/\\\\npublic Builder withPriceInDollars(int priceInDollars) {\\\\n this.priceInDollars = priceInDollars;\\\\n return this;\\\\n}\\\\n/**\\\\n* Sets the fields of the given instances to the corresponding values recorded when calling the \\\\\\\"with\\\\\\\" methods.\\\\n* @param instance\\\\n* The instance to be populated.\\\\n*/\\\\nprotected void populate(Beer instance) {\\\\n instance.setBeerId(this.beerId);\\\\n instance.setName(this.name);\\\\n instance.setDescription(this.description);\\\\n instance.setBeerCompanyName(this.beerCompanyName);\\\\n instance.setBeerTypeName(this.beerTypeName);\\\\n instance.setPriceInDollars(this.priceInDollars);\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n## Test the updated model using the Coral Explorer[¶][10]\\\\n1. In the service package (`src/BT111_username_`), run the server with:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-build server\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n2. Navigate to `http://_cloud-desktop-hostname_:8080/explorer/index.html` and refresh the page. You may need to perform a hard refresh with cmd+shift+R (macOS) or ctrl+shift+R (Ubuntu or Windows).\\\\n3. Click the CreateBeer link on the left. You should now see the new `priceInDollars` member in the Request Data field.\\\\n4. Change the values of each member and click the Call CreateBeer button to see `priceInDollars` in the response.\\\\nGreat job adding a new member to your model.

Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with AmazonJavaFormat\\\\n# Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with AmazonJavaFormat[¶][1]\\\\n* [Configuration][2]\\\\n* [Usage][3]\\\\n * [Applying PeruGradleJavaPresets with Spotless][4]\\\\n * [Overriding the default Spotless and AmazonJavaFormat settings][5]\\\\n  * [Overriding the default Spotless settings][6]\\\\n  * [Overriding the default AmazonJavaFormat settings][7]\\\\n* [Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with other supported tools][8]\\\\nThis page provides instructions on how to use the [PeruGradleJavaPresets][9] plugin with [AmazonJavaFormat][10] utilizing [Spotless][11].\\\\nImportant\\\\nPlease read [Using code quality tools with PeruGradleJavaPresets][12] before reading this page. It has general instructions and prerequisites on using the PeruGradleJavaPresets plugin.\\\\n## Configuration[¶][2]\\\\nPeruGradleJavaPresets provides the following default settings for Spotless:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nspotless {\\\\n   encoding(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)\\\\n\\\\n   java {\\\\n      // excludes generated source files inside the build, target, generated and generated-src directories\\\\n      targetExclude(\\\\\\\"**/build/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/target/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/generated/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/generated-src/**\\\\\\\");\\\\n      // applies Amazon Java code style\\\\n      addStep(createAmazonJavaFormatStep(\\\\\\\"AMAZON\\\\\\\"))\\\\n\\\\n      // fixes annotations formatting for inline type annotations\\\\n      formatAnnotations()\\\\n      trimTrailingWhitespace()\\\\n      endWithNewline()\\\\n   }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n`isEnforceCheck` is set to `false` if the build is on the build fleet. Otherwise, it is set to `true`.\\\\nPeruGradleJavaPresets provides the following default settings for AmazonJavaFormat:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nformatter.code.style=AMAZON\\\\nformatter.apply.on.build=false\\\\nformatter.fail.on.diff=true\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n`formatter.fail.on.diff` is set to `false` if the build is on the build fleet. Otherwise, it is set to `true`.\\\\nYou can specify your own Spotless and AmazonJavaFormat settings. Refer to [Overriding the default Spotless and AmazonJavaFormat settings][13] for more information.\\\\n## Usage[¶][3]\\\\n### Applying PeruGradleJavaPresets with Spotless[¶][4]\\\\nIn the `plugins` block of your `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`, add the Spotless Gradle plugin along with the PeruGradleJavaPresets plugin:\\\\nGroovybuild.gradle[¶][14]\\\\n```\\\\nplugins {\\\\n   // ...\\\\n   // other plugins\\\\n   // ...\\\\n\\\\n   id 'com.diffplug.spotless' version '6.+'\\\\n   id 'software.amazon.peru.java-presets' version '1.0.+'\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nKotlinbuild.gradle.kts[¶][15]\\\\n```\\\\nplugins {\\\\n   // ...\\\\n   // other plugins\\\\n   // ...\\\\n\\\\n   id(\\\\\\\"com.diffplug.spotless\\\\\\\") version \\\\\\\"6.+\\\\\\\"\\\\n   id(\\\\\\\"software.amazon.peru.java-presets\\\\\\\") version \\\\\\\"1.0.+\\\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n### Overriding the default Spotless and AmazonJavaFormat settings[¶][5]\\\\nIf you want to use your own Spotless or AmazonJavaFormat settings, you can override some or all of the settings provided by the PeruGradleJavaPresets plugin.\\\\n#### Overriding the default Spotless settings[¶][6]\\\\nOverriding default Spotless settings by using the `spotless` block in `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`. For example:\\\\nGroovybuild.gradle[¶][16]\\\\n```\\\\nspotless {\\\\n   setEnforceCheck(true)\\\\n\\\\n   java {\\\\n      target(\\\\\\\"**/src/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/generated-src/**\\\\\\\")\\\\n      targetExclude(\\\\\\\"**/build/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/target/**\\\\\\\")\\\\n   }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nKotlinbuild.gradle.kts[¶][17]\\\\n```\\\\nspotless {\\\\n   isEnforceCheck = true\\\\n\\\\n   java {\\\\n      target(\\\\\\\"**/src/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/generated-src/**\\\\\\\")\\\\n      targetExclude(\\\\\\\"**/build/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/target/**\\\\\\\")\\\\n   }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nSee the [Spotless Gradle plugin Quickstart instructions][18] for more information.\\\\nNote\\\\nIf you only need default Spotless settings provided by PeruGradleJavaPresets, you do not need to modify `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`.\\\\n#### Overriding the default AmazonJavaFormat settings[¶][7]\\\\nOverride default AmazonJavaFormat settings by specifying some Gradle properties in a `gradle.properties` file under the `/project_root`. The following properties are available:\\\\n|Property name|Type|Description|Default value|\\\\n|---|---|---|---|\\\\n|`formatter.code.style`|Enum|Set the code style to use. One of `AMAZON`, `PALANTIR`, `GOOGLE`, `AOSP`.|`AMAZON`|\\\\n|`formatter.apply.on.build`|Boolean|Set if AmazonJavaFormat formats your code automatically when the `assemble` task runs.|`false`|\\\\n|`formatter.fail.on.diff`|Boolean|Set if the build fails when the code is not formatted properly. If you set the value to either `false` or `true` in the `gradle.properties` file, then it will be applied to both local and build fleet builds.|`false` if the build is on the build fleet. `true` if the build is not on the build fleet (local build).|\\\\n\\\\nFor example:\\\\ngradle.properties[¶][19]\\\\n```\\\\n// ...\\\\n// other properties\\\\n// ...\\\\n\\\\nformatter.code.style=GOOGLE\\\\nformatter.apply.on.build=true\\\\nformatter.fail.on.diff=true\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nNote\\\\nIf you only need default AmazonJavaFormat settings provided by PeruGradleJavaPresets, you do not need to modify `gradle.properties`.\\\\n## Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with other supported tools[¶][8]\\\\n* Instructions on using SpotBugs with PeruGradleJavaPresets configurations: [Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with SpotBugs][20]\\\\n* Instructions on using JaCoCo with PeruGradleJavaPresets configurations: [Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with JaCoCo][21]\\\\n* Instructions on using Checkstyle with PeruGradleJavaPresets configurations: [Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with Checkstyle][22]\\\\nNext page:[Vending code for Peru][23]Previous page:[Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with Checkstyle][22]\\\\n[1]: #using-perugradlejavapresets-with-amazonjavaformat\\\\n[2]: #configuration\\\\n[3]: #usage\\\\n[4]: #applying-perugradlejavapresets-with-spotless\\\\n[5]: #overriding-the-default-spotless-and-amazonjavaformat-settings\\\\n[6]: #overriding-the-default-spotless-settings\\\\n[7]: #overriding-the-default-amazonjavaformat-settings\\\\n[8]: #using-perugradlejavapresets-with-other-supported-tools\\\\n[9]: https://code.amazon.com/packages/PeruGradleJavaPresets\\\\n[10]: https://code.amazon.com/packages/AmazonJavaFormat\\\\n[11]: https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-gradle\\\\n[12]: ../howto-java-presets-gradle-plugin/\\\\n[13]: #overriding-default-spotless-and-amazonjavaformat-settings\\\\n[14]: #id3\\\\n[15]: #id4\\\\n[16]: #id5\\\\n[17]: #id6\\\\n[18]: https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/blob/main/plugin-gradle/README.md#quickstart\\\\n[19]: #id7\\\\n[20]: ../howto-java-presets-gradle-plugin-with-spotbugs/\\\\n[21]: ../howto-java-presets-gradle-plugin-with-jacoco/\\\\n[22]: ../howto-java-presets-gradle-plugin-with-checkstyle/\\\\n[23]: ../vending-code/\\\"}}\"},{\"url\":\"https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/contributing/\",\"displayTitle\":\"How to contribute or leave feedback\",\"domain\":\"builder_hub\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1755820800000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":3,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\",\\\"relativeHrefsDescription\\\":\\\"Relative hrefs represent related documents that can be accessed by evaluating the relative path with respect to the input URL.

As you write code, Amazon Q Developer automatically generates suggestions based on your existing code and comments. Your personalized recommendations can vary in size and scope, ranging from a single line comment to fully formed functions. For Amazon builders, inline code recommendations from Amazon Q Developer can take advantage of the [Custom model][15], which has been customized on thousands of packages in Amazon’s internal codebase. For more information, see [Get inline suggestions with Amazon Q][16] in the _Amazon Q Developer User Guide_.\\\\nFor up to date language support, see [Language support in Amazon Q][17] in the _Amazon Q Developer User Guide_.\\\\n## Best practices[¶][2]\\\\nType lessAt the most basic level, Amazon Q Developer can be used as a supercharged auto-complete, significantly reducing your typing when writing individual lines or blocks of code. To use Amazon Q Developer in this way, just write code as you normally would. Amazon Q Developer will make automatic suggestions as you type. Accept suggestions when they are helpful, and ignore them when the are not.\\\\nMore context equals better suggestionsWhen starting out with Amazon Q Developer, it is common for builders to start with a blank file. But in some ways, this is the worst scenario for Amazon Q Developer to handle because it has very little context to play off of. In real-world usage, where a builder is using Amazon Q Developer on projects and files that already contain other code, you’ll notice a significant improvement in how helpful (and accurate) Amazon Q Developer becomes.\\\\nAdd import statements firstOne easy trick to give Amazon Q Developer context (even in new files) is to start by manually adding import statements at the top of the file, indicating which library Amazon Q Developer should should use in its implementation. For example, when writing a Python script that interacts with AWS services, start by importing `boto3` before prompting Amazon Q Developer to write code. You’ll typically get better results because Amazon Q Developer can detect your intentions already.\\\\nExperiment with different prompt engineering methodsPrompt engineering is an art and science of its own. Here are some quick tips to get you started:\\\\n* When writing code comments, use full sentences rather than sentence fragments.\\\\n* Code comments that read like API documentation often produce better results that code comments written in other styles.\\\\n* Don’t rely on code comments alone. Other code in a file provides valuable context that will make Amazon Q Developer’s suggestions more accurate. So just start writing code and you’ll see the suggestions improve.\\\\n* Amazon Q Developer is hesitant to suggest code that uses libraries or packages that aren’t referenced elsewhere in the file. Importing the libraries you want Amazon Q Developer to use will generate better suggestions.\\\\n* Don’t write comments that try to do too much. If your comment describes multiple steps or complex algorithms in detail it is unlikely that Amazon Q Developer will respond exactly the way you expect it to. It’s better to break the comment prompts into smaller pieces, each focused on a single task.\\\\n* Starting with a function signature, rather than a code comment, can be an effective way to get good suggestions from Amazon Q Developer.\\\\n* Use descriptive names for your classes, functions, and arguments. Descriptive names give Amazon Q Developer clearer context to work with.\\\\nSee [Usage examples][18] for different examples that have worked well for builders in different contexts.\\\\nExperiment with not using comment promptsType your code as you normally would, and see what suggestions Amazon Q Developer offers as it starts to understand your objectives through the code itself.\\\\nUse Amazon Q Developer in a real projectWhile Amazon Q Developer can sometimes (but not always) be impressive in trivial demo examples, it is much more valuable when it’s applied to a real project. Before drawing conclusions about Amazon Q Developer, try it on real-world code to get a more realistic sense of the value it provides.\\\\n## Usage examples[¶][3]\\\\nThese following usage examples should help you to get started using Amazon Q Developer for your own inline code suggestions. These are just illustrative samples to show you how to trigger the coding assistant for your own projects, and in many cases, you could find a more suitable library to implement the results of these examples.\\\\nRemember, it’s always up to you to verify that the suggested code works the way that you want it to.\\\\n### Generating functions[¶][4]\\\\n#### Automatically generating function bodies from signatures[¶][5]\\\\nSkilled programmers use clear, descriptive names for their functions and parameters. If you follow this practice in your own programming, Amazon Q Developer will have all the context it needs to implement many functions for you.\\\\nUser input (JavaScript):\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nfunction logMeanToConsole(numbers)\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nResult:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nfunction logMeanToConsole(numbers)\\\\n{\\\\n let sum = 0;\\\\n for (let i = 0; i {\\\\n if (typeof item === \\\\\\\"number\\\\\\\") {\\\\n return `#${item}`;\\\\n } else {\\\\n return `\\\\\\\"${item}\\\\\\\"`;\\\\n }\\\\n })\\\\n .join(\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\");\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n### Generating classes[¶][7]\\\\nYou can generate full or partial class implementations from a single code comment. The comment should describe the key properties and behaviors of the class. Simple descriptions are often all that is required.\\\\nUser input (TypeScript):\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n/**\\\\n * A folder has a name, children, and an optional parent. A child can't be added\\\\n * twice.\\\\n */\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nResult:\\\\nAfter writing the previous block comment, Amazon Q Developer provides multiple suggestions, including the following implementation, complete with documentation comments for each method.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n/**\\\\n * A folder has a name, children, and an optional parent. A child can't be added\\\\n * twice.\\\\n */\\\\nexport class Folder {\\\\n name: string;\\\\n children: Folder[];\\\\n parent?: Folder;\\\\n \\\\n constructor(name: string, parent?: Folder) {\\\\n this.name = name;\\\\n this.children = [];\\\\n this.parent = parent;\\\\n }\\\\n \\\\n /**\\\\n * Add a child to the folder.\\\\n * @param child The child to add.\\\\n * @returns True if the child was added, false if it was already present.\\\\n */\\\\n addChild(child: Folder): boolean {\\\\n if (this.children.includes(child)) {\\\\n return false;\\\\n }\\\\n this.children.push(child);\\\\n child.parent = this;\\\\n return true;\\\\n }\\\\n \\\\n /**\\\\n * Remove a child from the folder.\\\\n * @param child The child to remove.\\\\n * @returns True if the child was removed, false if it wasn't present.\\\\n */\\\\n removeChild(child: Folder): boolean {\\\\n const index = this.children.indexOf(child);\\\\n if (index === -1) {\\\\n return\"},{\"url\":\"https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/learning/bt112-test-your-service/\",\"displayTitle\":\"BT112: Test your Coral Lambda Endpoint service\",\"domain\":\"builder_hub\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1755820800000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":5,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"t\\\\n assertEquals(2, output.getString());\\\\n // Print the result for visibility\\\\n System.out.println(\\\\\\\"Word count: \\\\\\\" + output.getString());\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n3. Add a test method for the `TextTooLongException`. The following test validates that the `WordCount` operation correctly throws a `TextTooLongException` when the input text is longer than the allowed maximum:\\\\nAWS customers\\\\n```\\\\n@Test\\\\npublic void testTextTooLong() {\\\\n String input = \\\\\\\"Hello Lambda! Hello Lambda! Hello Lambda!\\\\\\\";\\\\n assertThrows(TextTooLongException.class, () -> {\\\\n WordCountCall call = client.newWordCountCall();\\\\n call.call(WordCountInput.builder().withString(input).build());\\\\n });\\\\n System.out.println(\\\\\\\"Input text exceeds maximum length!\\\\\\\");\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nSDO customers\\\\n```\\\\n@Test\\\\npublic void testTextTooLong() {\\\\n String input = \\\\\\\"Hello Lambda! Hello Lambda! Hello Lambda!\\\\\\\";\\\\n assertThrows(TextTooLongException.class, () -> {\\\\n WordCountCall call = CLIENT.newWordCountCall();\\\\n call.call(WordCountInput.builder().withString(input).build());\\\\n });\\\\n System.out.println(\\\\\\\"Input text exceeds maximum length!\\\\\\\");\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n4. Add the following import to the top of `SimpleIntegrationTest.java`:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nimport com.amazon.bt112_username_.impl.WordCountCall;\\\\n```\\\\n5. Update the `stage` and `region`: When running integration tests, you need to make sure that your test client is pointing to the correct environment where your service is deployed. This typically involves setting the appropriate stage (alpha, beta, gamma, prod, etc.) and AWS region.\\\\nYou can quickly find the values for these two variables in your Pipelines. You’ll want to set `stage` to the location of your integration tests (`\\\\\\\"alpha\\\\\\\"` in the example below) and `region` to where your service is deployed (`\\\\\\\"us-west-2\\\\\\\"` in this case). Using the wrong stage or region will cause your integration tests to fail, as they won’t be able to locate or communicate with your service.\\\\n![\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"][13]Open your application [Pipelines][14] to find these values and update accordingly.\\\\nAWS customers\\\\n```\\\\n@BeforeAll\\\\npublic void setup() throws Exception {\\\\n\\\\n String stage = \\\\\\\"alpha\\\\\\\";\\\\n if (stage == null) {\\\\n throw new RuntimeException(\\\\n \\\\\\\"Stage is not configured. It should be passed as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"STAGE\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" environment variable\\\\\\\"\\\\n );\\\\n }\\\\n\\\\n if (null == endpoint) {\\\\n synchronized (SimpleIntegrationTest.class) {\\\\n if (null == endpoint) {\\\\n String region = \\\\\\\"us-west-2\\\\\\\";\\\\n if (region == null) {\\\\n throw new RuntimeException(\\\\n \\\\\\\"AWS region is not configured. It should be passed as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"AWS_REGION\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\n + \\\\\\\"environment variable\\\\\\\"\\\\n );\\\\n }\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nSDO customers\\\\n```\\\\n@TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)\\\\npublic class SimpleIntegrationTest {\\\\n private static final BT112SDO3Client CLIENT;\\\\n private static final BT112SDO3Client NO_AUTH_CLIENT;\\\\n\\\\n static {\\\\n String stage = \\\\\\\"alpha\\\\\\\";\\\\n String region = \\\\\\\"us-west-2\\\\\\\";\\\\n\\\\n String qualifier = String.format(\\\\\\\"%s.%s\\\\\\\", stage, region);\\\\n ClientBuilder clientBuilder = new ClientBuilder();\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n6. Rebuild your project after first cleaning your workspace. Run:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil ws clean; brazil-recursive-cmd --allPackages brazil-build\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n## Initiate another code review[¶][6]\\\\nTo run your new tests, you’ll need to deploy your updated code to Lambda. Your integration tests will fail unless your Lambda function has been updated with the latest code. Since you’ve made some significant changes to your service, however, you’ll do this via a code review first. Deployment to Lambda will happen automatically after you merge into the main branch.\\\\n### Use Q CLI as a preliminary reviewer[¶][7]\\\\nBefore submitting your code review, it’s a good practice to have Amazon Q perform a preliminary review of your changes. This can help you catch potential issues and improve code quality before human reviewers examine your work.\\\\nTo use Q CLI as a preliminary reviewer:\\\\n1. In your terminal, run Q CLI with the following prompt:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nq chat \\\\\\\"Conduct a code review of this workspace\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nQ CLI will analyze your code and should provide feedback on:\\\\n * Code quality: Potential bugs, performance issues, or maintainability concerns\\\\n * Best practices: Adherence to Java coding standards and Amazon development guidelines\\\\n * Test coverage: Whether your integration tests adequately cover your new functionality\\\\n * Error handling: Proper exception handling and edge case coverage\\\\n\\\\n2. Prompt Q CLI to implement 1 or 2 of its suggested changes. Prioritize those that are both high-impact and easy to implement. Avoid making extensive changes that could introduce new issues or significantly delay your code review submission.\\\\n3. After implementing any selected improvements, prompt Q CLI to verify your project still builds successfully:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nVerify that my project builds successfully after these recent changes.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nFollow Q CLI’s guidance to run the appropriate build commands and resolve any build issues.\\\\nNote\\\\nIt is worth noting yet again that you should review each suggestion from Q CLI carefully. While Q CLI provides valuable insights, not all suggestions may be appropriate for your specific use case or development context. Always understand what each suggested change does and verify it aligns with your project’s requirements and coding standards before applying it. When in doubt, consult with your team or skip suggestions that you’re uncertain about.\\\\n### Submit your CR[¶][8]\\\\n1. Save and commit your changes for the Lambda (`BT112_username_`), model, and tests packages.\\\\n2. Create a new code review (CR) by running this command within your workspace:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ncr --new-review --all\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n3. Follow the printed URL to access the CR.\\\\n4. Add reviewers and a meaningful review description.\\\\n5. Publish the review for others to examine.\\\\n6. Address any feedback or concerns raised by reviewers. If you don’t have a team member to review your change, you can use the [#sb-onboarding-code-review-requests][15] Slack channel.\\\\n7. Once you’ve implemented any feedback and your CR has been approved, click the Merge button in the CR dashboard.\\\\n## Enable the integration tests[¶][9]\\\\nImportant\\\\nThis section of the workshop pertains to **SDO builders only**. If you are an AWS builder, please proceed to [Run the integration tests][16].\\\\nYou may have noticed your pipeline is now blocked due to integration test failures. This is because your service needs proper authentication and authorization configuration before the integration tests can successfully communicate with your deployed service.\\\\nIn this section, you’ll configure the Authentication, Authorization, and CloudAuth (AAA) settings for your service. This involves:\\\\n* Registering your new `WordCount` operation in the AAA system.\\\\n* Setting up the proper access permissions between your test client and service.\\\\n* Configuring IAM roles to allow local testing.\\\\n### Enable tests in your pipeline[¶][10]\\\\nTo successfully run the integration tests in your pipeline:\\\\n1. Open your [ServiceLens dashboard][17].\\\\n2. In the search bar at the top, enter and select the name of your app (`BT112_username_`).\\\\n3. Click the Services tab, followed by the name of your service under Service Name.\\\\n4. In top right, click the Request Access button.\\\\n![\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"][18]Note\\\\nIf you have an Add Dependency button instead of a Request Access button:\\\\n 1. Click the Add Dependency button.\\\\n 2. Select your service from the Service Name dropdown.\\\\n 3. Select WordCount from the Service Operations dropdown.\\\\n 4. Click the Submit button.\\\\n 5. Proceed to restart Hydra Tests in your pipeline (last step in this section).\\\\n5. In the popup, select the name of your application in the Client Application dropdown. An Action not supported message may appear; click the View in AAA button next to that message.\\\\n6. You should see your `Echo` operation selected and `WordCount` operation below that, unselected. Click the checkbox next to WordCount and enter a description in the field that appears.\\\\n![\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"][19]\\\\n7. Click the Update Request reply relationship button.\\\\n8.

In this phase, the goal is to transition from guided experimentation to **seamless integration**.\\\\nYou’ll explore **complementary tools** that fill specific gaps, embed AI more deeply into regular workflows, and begin **capturing team knowledge**. AI moves from being a cool experiment to a **trusted productivity multiplier**.\\\\n## Step 1: Expanded tool usage[¶][4]\\\\n**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours\\\\n**Why it matters**: Teams often benefit from pairing one primary tool with 1-2 complementary tools, tailored to their workflow needs.\\\\nUse insights from Phase 1 to decide whether expanding your toolset makes sense. If current tools fall short in key areas, thoughtfully introduce additional ones - but avoid overload.\\\\n**How to do this**:\\\\n1. Review feedback from Phase 1 to identify pain points or capability gaps.\\\\n2. Introduce 1-2 complementary tools to fill those gaps.\\\\n * Start with our [Complementary Tool Selection Matrix Template][12].\\\\n * Example: For automated code upgrades, explore [Ironhide][13] (Amazon Q Developer-based CLI for tasks like Java 8 → 17 migrations)\\\\n\\\\n3. Host short demos (15-30 mins) focused on real, practical applications.\\\\n4. Share getting-started guides or docs for new tools.\\\\n5. Track which tool pairings work best for specific scenarios.\\\\nNote\\\\nDon’t introduce too many tools at once. One core tool + one well-chosen complement = the sweet spot.\\\\n## Step 2: Workflow integration[¶][5]\\\\n**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours over 1-2 weeks\\\\n**Why it matters**: Sustained adoption happens when tools become part of _how you work_, not extra effort.\\\\nMove beyond individual tasks. This step is about integrating AI tools into your team’s core development processes and lifecycle - planning, building, testing, releasing, monitoring, documenting, and more.\\\\n**How to do this**:\\\\n1. Identify natural integration points:\\\\n * Planning: Break down stories, estimate complexity with AI\\\\n * Development: Use AI in IDEs and code review processes\\\\n * Testing: Generate and maintain tests with AI\\\\n * Docs: Set AI-assisted documentation updates as a standard step\\\\n * Maintenance: Use AI for debugging and refactoring patterns\\\\n\\\\n2. Block 2-3 hours/week of protected time for team members to apply and refine these integrations\\\\n3. Organize pair programming sessions, pairing experienced users with newer adopters\\\\n4. Begin tracking workflow-level metrics, not just tool usage\\\\n5. Address any obstacles that emerge in applying tools to real workflow challenges\\\\nNote\\\\nDon’t add steps - enhance existing ones. A “Pre-review with AI” step before code reviews improves code quality and cuts review cycles.\\\\n## Step 3: Knowledge sharing \\\\\\\\(ongoing\\\\\\\\)[¶][6]\\\\n**Estimated effort**: 30-60 mins to set up, then ongoing\\\\n**Why it matters**: What your team learns in real time is gold. Capture it before it disappears.\\\\nKnowledge sharing becomes critical in this phase to scale success, avoid duplication, and accelerate learning across the team and org.\\\\n**How to do this**:\\\\n1. Choose a central place to collect insights. Options to consider:\\\\n * Creating a dedicated “AI Playbook” page on your team wiki\\\\n * Starting a Quip document with sections for different use cases\\\\n * Creating a GitFarm repo with examples and prompt libraries\\\\n\\\\n2. Establish lightweight documentation standards. Important aspects include:\\\\n * Use before/after examples\\\\n * Capture both wins and limitations\\\\n * Apply consistent formatting so it’s easy to browse\\\\n\\\\n3. Schedule regular share-outs. Formats might include:\\\\n * 10-min AI segment in team meetings\\\\n * Monthly lunch & learns\\\\n * “AI Tip of the Week” posts\\\\n\\\\n4. Enable cross-team learning. Try to:\\\\n * Post in [#amazon-builder-genai-power-users][14]\\\\n * Add content to org-level knowledge hubs\\\\n * Present in cross-team technical demos or AMAs\\\\n * Run occasional exchange sessions with other teams\\\\n\\\\nNote\\\\nUse AI tools themselves to help with documentation. For example, have Amazon Q Developer generate initial documentation of a successful pattern that you can then refine.\\\\n## Troubleshooting[¶][7]\\\\n**Team members using tools inconsistently?**Integrate AI tools into existing workflow rituals - for example, start code reviews by having Amazon Q Developer analyze the code first, or begin sprint planning with AI-assisted task breakdown. Designate specific “AI-assisted days” where the team collectively focuses on using the tools. Create usage challenges tied to team goals.\\\\n**Struggling to move beyond basic use cases?**Schedule a focused workshop specifically on advanced use cases. Invite an experienced user from another team to demonstrate their workflows. Use the “pair and share” technique where two developers work together to solve a complex problem with AI assistance. Review the [QDevTips Library][15] for more advanced examples from other teams.\\\\n**Different team members developing different approaches?**Diversity in approaches is valuable during this phase - encourage experimentation while capturing the different techniques. Create a weekly share-out where team members demonstrate their unique approaches. After 2-3 weeks of divergent exploration, hold a consolidation session to identify best practices that the team wants to standardize.\\\\n**Documentation creating excess overhead?**Use lightweight documentation approaches like a shared Slack channel with threaded conversations for different use cases. Create a simple template for knowledge-sharing that team members can complete in 5 minutes or less. Consider using AI tools themselves to help document the process - for example, using Amazon Q Developer to generate documentation about how the team is using Amazon Q Developer.\\\\n**Team enthusiasm waning in Phase 2?**Refresh interest by highlighting concrete metrics from Phase 1, celebrating early wins, and introducing new use cases. Sometimes teams need to see the cumulative impact of their efforts to maintain motivation. Consider friendly competition or recognition for innovative applications to maintain momentum.\\\\n## Resources[¶][8]\\\\n* [Template: Complementary Tool Selection Matrix][12]\\\\n* [Ironhide][13]\\\\n* [QDevTips Library][15]\\\\n* [#amazon-builder-genai-power-users][14]\\\\nNext page:[Phase 3: Measure & adjust][16]Previous page:[Phase 1: Set up & first wins][17]\\\\n[1]: #phase-2-expand-integrate\\\\n[2]: #key-steps\\\\n[3]: #why-phase-2-matters\\\\n[4]: #step-1-expanded-tool-usage\\\\n[5]: #step-2-workflow-integration\\\\n[6]: #step-3-knowledge-sharing-ongoing\\\\n[7]: #troubleshooting\\\\n[8]: #resources\\\\n[9]: #expanded-tool-usage\\\\n[10]: #workflow-integration\\\\n[11]: #knowledge-sharing\\\\n[12]: https://quip-amazon.com/O74VAOgp8R2u/Template-Complementary-Tool-Selection-Matrix\\\\n[13]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/ironhide/index.html\\\\n[14]: https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C08GJKNC3KM\\\\n[15]: https://builderhub.corp.amazon.com/blog/tag/qdevtips\\\\n[16]: ../adoption-phase3/\\\\n[17]: ../adoption-phase1/\\\"}}\"},{\"url\":\"https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/brazil/user-guide/tools-brazil-path/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Brazil path\",\"domain\":\"builder_hub\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1755820800000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":7,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"d will then fail.\\\\n## Variables[¶][7]\\\\nThere are two types of variables that you’ll be working with:\\\\n* [Simple variables][28]\\\\n* [Complex Variables][29]\\\\n### Simple variables[¶][8]\\\\n_Simple_ variables are those whose values are calculated from the current package—they are not affected by the dependency graph.\\\\nHere are the simple variables you can use with **brazil-path**. They always consider the dependencies of the _current package only_, they cannot be scoped as a complex variable can be.\\\\n||\\\\n||\\\\n||\\\\n||\\\\n|Name|Description|Example output|\\\\n|`package-build-root`|The path to the current package’s `build` directory (where package artifacts will be produced).|`/home/ANT.AMAZON.COM/username/workplace/my-workpace/build/MyPackage/MyPackage-1.0/RHEL5_64/DEV.STD.PTHREAD/build`|\\\\n|`package-major-version`|The `interfaces` value (AKA _major version_) of the current package.|`1.0`|\\\\n|`package-name`|The name of the current package.|`MyPackage`|\\\\n|`package-name-full-version`|The current package’s name and full version.|`MyPackage-1.0.x.x`|\\\\n|`package-src-root`|The path to the current package’s source directory.|`/home/ANT.AMAZON.COM/username/workplace/my-workspace/src/MyPackage`|\\\\n|`workspace-root`|The path to the current workspace root.|`/home/ANT.AMAZON.COM/username/workplace/my-workspace`|\\\\n\\\\n### Complex Variables[¶][9]\\\\n_Complex_ variables are a bit more…complex. Complex variables have a two-part name:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n_graph_name.recipe_name_\\\\n```\\\\nWhere:\\\\n* `_graph_name_` represents the _scope_ that’s used by the _recipe_. See [Brazil path graph][30] to see what values are supported.\\\\n* `_recipe_name_` represents the type of information to retrieve from the _graph_ provided. See [Brazil path recipes][27] to see what values are supported.\\\\nTo print out the complete list of graphs and recipes available on the command-line, use:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path -list\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n## Formatting output[¶][10]\\\\nThe output format of **brazil-path** is controlled by the optional `--format` argument which can override the default formatting behavior.\\\\n### Default format[¶][11]\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path _variable_\\\\n```\\\\nIn the absence of the `--format` option, brazil-path will simply dump raw values produced by the requested recipe to stdout. The intent here is to make it easy to embed these calls into shell scripts.\\\\nHowever, there is a more efficient way of utilizing **brazil-path** from a shell script:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nexport PERL5LIB=$(brazil-path all.perllib)\\\\n\\\\nfor file in $(brazil-path all.config)\\\\ndo\\\\n ls -l $file\\\\ndone\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nImportant\\\\n**brazil-path** will only accept one variable name in its argument list when using default format mode.\\\\n### –format=json[¶][12]\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path --format=json _ [ ...]_\\\\n```\\\\nReturns JSON data format compatible with most JSON parsers.\\\\n* You can use it from Java using `org.json.JSONObject(java.lang.Stringsource)`\\\\n* In Python, you can use `importjson;json.loads(string)`\\\\nExample:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path --format=json build.classpath run.classpath\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nOutput:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\\\\"build.classpath\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\".../lib/BrazilDependencyResolver.jar:.../lib/BrazilWorkspaceLib.jar:...\\\\\\\",\\\\n \\\\\\\"run.classpath\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\".../lib/BrazilPackageCacher.jar:.../lib/BrazilCommonJavaTypes.jar:...\\\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n### –format=make[¶][13]\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path --format=make [ ...]\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n* Compatible with GNU Make\\\\n* Assumes a set of constants is already defined\\\\n* Supports multiple variables\\\\nAny variable name or value that contains any “special” characters will be translated according to the following table:\\\\n|Character|Will be translated to|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|`(`|`$(L_PAREN)`|\\\\n|`)`|`$(R_PAREN)`|\\\\n|`\\\\\\\\n`|`$(NEWLINE)`|\\\\n|`\\\\\\\\t`|`$(TAB)`|\\\\n|`#`|`$(POUND)`|\\\\n|`,`|`$(COMMA)`|\\\\n|`\\\\\\\\x20`|`$(SPACE)`|\\\\n\\\\nExample:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path --format=make pkg.bin pkg.lib\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nOutput:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\npkg.bin:=/workplace/foo/build/YourPackage/YourPackage-1.0/X86_LINUX_GCC32_GLIBC23/DEV.STD.PTHREAD/build/bin\\\\npkg.lib:=/workplace/foo/build/YourPackage/YourPackage-1.0/X86_LINUX_GCC32_GLIBC23/DEV.STD.PTHREAD/build/lib\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n### –format=properties[¶][14]\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path --format=properties _ [ ...]_\\\\n```\\\\n* Compatible with the Java standard property parser. You can use it from Java using `java.util.Properties#load`.\\\\nExample:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path --format=properties build.classpath run.classpath\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nOutput (generated by brazil-path ‘properties’ formatter):\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n#Mon Nov 23 09:12:55 PST 2009\\\\nrun.classpath=.../lib/BrazilServiceToolkit.jar\\\\\\\\:.../lib/commons-betwixt-20061229.jar\\\\\\\\:...\\\\nbuild.classpath=.../lib/commons-betwixt-20061229.jar\\\\\\\\:.../lib/commons-beanutils.jar\\\\\\\\:...\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n### –format=perl[¶][15]\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path --format=perl _ [ ...]_\\\\n```\\\\n* Compatible with the Perl `eval()` built-in fuction.\\\\nExample:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path --format=perl build.classpath run.classpath\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nOutput (generated by brazil-path ‘perl’ formatter using the ISO-8859-1 character set):\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\n'build.classpath' => '.../lib/commons-betwixt-20061229.jar:.../lib/commons-beanutils.jar:...',\\\\n'run.classpath' => '.../lib/BrazilServiceToolkit.jar:.../lib/commons-betwixt-20061229.jar:...',\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n### –format=shell[¶][16]\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path --format=shell --prefix=__ __ _[ ...]_\\\\n```\\\\n* Generates a shell function named via the parameter. This function can later be used to fetch the value of an individual variable. Using brazil-path from a shell this way is more efficient if you have multiple variables that you want to fetch, since the dependency closure cache will be effective, and you avoid the cost of starting up the JVM on each invocation.\\\\nExample:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path --format=shell --prefix=dapath build.classpath run.classpath\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nOutput (generated by **brazil-path** ‘shell’ formatter using the ISO-8859-1 character set):\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nfunction dapath () {\\\\n [ \\\\\\\"$1\\\\\\\" = 'build.classpath' ] && echo '.../lib/commons-betwixt-20061229.jar:.../lib/commons-beanutils.jar:...' && exit\\\\n [ \\\\\\\"$1\\\\\\\" = 'run.classpath' ] && echo '.../lib/BrazilServiceToolkit.jar:.../lib/commons-betwixt-20061229.jar:...' && exit\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nTo use, this from the shell, it is easiest to use the built-in `eval` function as such:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nset -e\\\\neval_me=\\\\\\\"$(brazil-path -format=shell -prefix=dapath build.classpath run.classpath)\\\\\\\"\\\\neval \\\\\\\"$eval_me\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nNote\\\\nIt is important to do this as two separate operations, so that a failure in **brazil-path** will cause the shell script to fail.\\\\nTo use dapath function, always enclose it in $() as such:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\necho build.classpath=\\\\\\\"$(dapath build.classpath)\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n`dapath` needs to be ran in a sub-shell since it uses the builtin exit function. This will be changed in the future so that instead of using exit it uses return.\\\\nAs a workaround, you can wrap the poorly-behaved output of `brazil-path` into a well-behaved shell function:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbroken_brazil_path_src=$( \\\\\\\\\\\\n brazil-path --format shell --prefix broken_brazil_path \\\\\\\\\\\\n build.classpath \\\\\\\\\\\\n run.classpath # etc\\\\n)\\\\neval \\\\\\\"$broken_brazil_path_src\\\\\\\"\\\\nfunction brazil-path-cached() {\\\\n # The builtin one uses `exit`, so needs a subshell. It indicates failures\\\\n # by not exiting at all (!?).\\\\n (broken_brazil_path \\\\\\\"$1\\\\\\\"; exit 1)\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n**brazil-path-cached\\\\\\\\`** does not need to be run in a subshell, and is capable of indicating a failure, unlike the output of `brazil-path--formatshell`.\\\\n## Extending and customizing brazil-path[¶][17]\\\\nEvery effort has been made to make **brazil-path** easily extensible. Consult the following documents to learn how to:\\\\n* Write custom graphs (_need a link here!_)\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> Todo\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> Fix this.

Here are common use cases for Java:\\\\n  Web servicesJava is the language chosen for Amazon Software Builder Experience (ASBX)’s Golden Paths for building web services with [Coral][11]:\\\\n* 🏆  [Coral Service on Lambda \\\\\\\\(Brazil\\\\\\\\)][12]\\\\n* 🏆  [Coral Service on Fargate \\\\\\\\(Brazil\\\\\\\\)][13]\\\\nFor more information about developing web services, see [Building web services][14].\\\\n   Mobile developmentJava is the preferred language for [Building Android applications][15].\\\\nFor more information about developing mobile apps, see [Building mobile applications][16].\\\\nNote\\\\nApplications marked with “🏆” are [ASBX Golden Paths][17], and represent Amazon’s _best practices_ in tooling, architecture, and configuration.\\\\n## IDEs and setup[¶][3]\\\\n1. **Set up your IDE**\\\\nSupported IDEs at Amazon are [IntelliJ IDEA][18] and [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)][19]. Instructions to install either are provided on the [IDE and plugin setup][20] page.\\\\nYou should also install the suggested plugin for integration with Amazon’s development tools, depending on the IDE you’re using:\\\\n * For IntelliJ, use [Black Caiman][21].\\\\n * For VS Code, use [Viceroy][22].\\\\n\\\\n2. **Set up a JDK**\\\\nNote\\\\n[AxE][23] handles the installation of runtimes for Java, Python, and Node.js, as well their dependencies (such as **mise**) for macOS and Cloud Desktop (see [the list here][24]). To get those and the most commonly used tools, run:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\naxe init builder-tools\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nIf you’ve configured your system with AxE, then language runtimes have already been set up; you can **skip this section**!\\\\nYou will need a Java/JDK runtime set up on your development system(s). Visit one (or both) of the following pages to install a JDK development environment, based on the [dependency model][25] you’ll be using:\\\\n * [Local Java setup for Brazil][26]\\\\n * [Local Java setup for Peru][27]\\\\n\\\\n3. (Optional) **Developing a mobile application?**\\\\nIf you are building an Android application, you should also follow [Set up your laptop for Android development][28] in the _Electric Company User Guide_.\\\\n## Building and packaging Java code[¶][4]\\\\nThe techniques you’ll use for building and packaging code at Amazon will depend on the [dependency model][25] you’ll be using for your code.\\\\n### Brazil development[¶][5]\\\\n* [Using Java with the Brazil dependency model][29]\\\\n### Peru development[¶][6]\\\\n* [Using Java with the Peru dependency model][30]\\\\n * [Gradle][31]\\\\n * [Maven][32]\\\\n\\\\n## Running Java services[¶][7]\\\\n* [JVM best practices][33]\\\\n * [JVM availability best practices][34]\\\\n * [Heap occupancy best practices][35]\\\\n * [Using the G1 garbage collector][36]\\\\n  * [Migrating to the G1 garbage collector][37]\\\\n  * [Tuning the G1 garbage collector][38]\\\\n  * [Dealing with Humongous objects in G1][39]\\\\n\\\\n * [Interpreting GC logs][40]\\\\n * [Investigating memory shortage][41]\\\\n * [JVM native memory explained][42]\\\\n * [Supporting fast zlib implementations][43]\\\\n\\\\n## Additional guides[¶][8]\\\\n* [Peru for Java Quickstart][44]\\\\n## Learning about Java[¶][9]\\\\n* Learn more about [Amazon Corretto][45].\\\\n## Support[¶][10]\\\\nGeneral support for Java developers* Visit the [Amazon Corretto][45] website.\\\\n* Search for answers on Sage using the [Java][46] tag.\\\\n* Join the [#java][47] Slack channel for general discussion of Java.\\\\n* Join the [#openjdk-help][48] Slack channel for specific help with OpenJDK.\\\\n* Subscribe to the [java-dev][49] email list.\\\\n* For a consultation with the JDK team, sign up for office hours:\\\\n * [JDK office hours \\\\\\\\(US\\\\\\\\)][50]\\\\n * [JDK office hours \\\\\\\\(Europe\\\\\\\\)][51]\\\\n\\\\nNext page:[Using Java with the Brazil dependency model][29]\\\\n[1]: #java\\\\n[2]: #use-cases\\\\n[3]: #setup\\\\n[4]: #building-and-packaging-java-code\\\\n[5]: #brazil-development\\\\n[6]: #peru-development\\\\n[7]: #running-java-services\\\\n[8]: #additional-guides\\\\n[9]: #learning-about-java\\\\n[10]: #support\\\\n[11]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/coral/index.html\\\\n[12]: https://create.hub.amazon.dev/source-applications/cle-java-lambda\\\\n[13]: https://create.hub.amazon.dev/source-applications/coral-fargate\\\\n[14]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/web-services/index.html\\\\n[15]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/electric-company/user-guide/develop-mobile-android.html\\\\n[16]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/mobile/index.html\\\\n[17]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/golden-path/index.html\\\\n[18]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/dev-setup/ide-plugin-setup.html#ide-setup-intellij\\\\n[19]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/dev-setup/ide-plugin-setup.html#ide-setup-vs-code\\\\n[20]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/dev-setup/ide-plugin-setup.html\\\\n[21]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/black-caiman/user-guide/getting-started.html\\\\n[22]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/viceroy/index.html#getting-started\\\\n[23]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/axe/index.html\\\\n[24]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/axe/user-guide/init-builder-tools.html\\\\n[25]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/brazil/user-guide/dependency-models-and-package-managers.html\\\\n[26]: brazil/#brazil-local-setup\\\\n[27]: peru/#peru-local-setup\\\\n[28]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/electric-company/user-guide/develop-mobile-android-setup.html\\\\n[29]: brazil/\\\\n[30]: peru/\\\\n[31]: peru-gradle/\\\\n[32]: peru-maven/\\\\n[33]: jvm-best-practices/\\\\n[34]: jvm-best-practices-availability/\\\\n[35]: jvm-best-practices-heap-occupancy/\\\\n[36]: jvm-best-practices-g1/\\\\n[37]: jvm-best-practices-g1-migrating/\\\\n[38]: jvm-best-practices-g1-tuning-sop/\\\\n[39]: jvm-best-practices-g1-humongous-objects/\\\\n[40]: jvm-best-practices-gc-log-sops/\\\\n[41]: jvm-best-practices-memory-usage-sop/\\\\n[42]: jvm-best-practices-native-memory/\\\\n[43]: jvm-best-practices-fast-zlib-implementations/\\\\n[44]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/brazil/peru-java-quickstart/index.html\\\\n[45]: https://aws.amazon.com/corretto\\\\n[46]: https://sage.amazon.dev/tags/java\\\\n[47]: https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C017Z68H0D9\\\\n[48]: https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C0184TZKTBN\\\\n[49]: https://unity.email.amazon.dev/list-archive/list/java-dev\\\\n[50]: https://office-hour-scheduler.tools.aws.dev/schedule/a8662172-dd8f-456f-bff1-39367db44afe\\\\n[51]: https://office-hour-scheduler.tools.aws.dev/schedule/41d72e33-1951-4802-9ee5-ebf8243312e2\\\"}}\"},{\"url\":\"https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/event-consumers/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Building event consumers\",\"domain\":\"builder_hub\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1755820800000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":9,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\" using for existing services and avoid using for new services.

Ask questions like:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nWhat business metrics should I record in this function to measure total revenue?\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nOr:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nWhat business metrics should I record for accounting purposes?\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nAmazon Q Developer will suggest relevant metrics based on your service’s business logic and industry best practices.\\\\n## Explore the emitted metrics[¶][4]\\\\nWhile the Coral Explorer can be used to test the API, it does not display emitted metrics. Instead, metrics are written to a file in your local development environment.\\\\n1. Restart your service with:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-build server\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n2. Create a beer and then update its price.\\\\n3. After the operations have completed, search for a file in your project named `metrics.log._current_date_and_time_`. You should be able to find it in the `BT111_username_/src/BT111_username_/build/private/var/output/logs/` directory. This file will contain the custom metrics you’ve emitted from the `BeerActivity` class.\\\\nUse the Find command (Ctrl+F or Command+F) to wade through the “noise” and find your metric.\\\\n![\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"][9]\\\\n4. Use Amazon Q Developer for increased metrics visibility and insights:\\\\n 1. Open the Amazon Q chat panel and with the proper metrics file set as context, ask:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nFind and analyze the Beer Created and Price Updated metrics.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nAmazon Q Developer will scan the `metrics.log` file to locate your custom metrics and filter out noise. It should identify usage patterns and correlate beer creation with price updates, explain what metric patterns indicate healthy service behavior, and compare the logged metrics against your `BeerActivity` implementation. It may even generate an automated Python script to assist with extracting metrics.\\\\nNote\\\\nYou can control noisy output (such as Python scripts or methods to analyze data instead of the analysis itself) by specifying your preference in the prompt. For example, add:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nProvide analysis only, no code.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nTo the end of your prompt to get direct insights rather than generated scripts.\\\\n 2. You can also use Amazon Q Developer to quickly parse through the entire file to reveal more digestible information about your service’s behavior and overall system health. Ask:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nExplain what these metrics indicate about system performance.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nAmazon Q Developer should provide an analysis of such things as metric frequency patterns, identify potential performance issues or anomalies, and offer recommendations for optimization based on the observed system behavior.\\\\n\\\\nThe next step would be to configure an appropriate metrics reporter to emit these metrics to your monitoring system of choice. The specific implementation details will depend on your deployment environment and requirements, but the principles you’ve learned here will apply regardless of the reporter you choose.\\\\n## Get your changes reviewed one last time[¶][5]\\\\nTo wrap things up, you’ll submit one more code review to make sure everything is top-notch. Before you do, however, explore the custom prompt feature in Amazon Q Developer to create a prompt that helps review documentation quality. Too often, code reviews focus only on functionality while overlooking documentation gaps.\\\\n### Create and use a custom prompt[¶][6]\\\\n1. In your IDE, open the Amazon Q panel.\\\\n2. In the chat window, type @ and click Prompts in the menu that appears.\\\\n3. Click Create a new prompt and provide:\\\\n 1. A name for your prompt (e.g., `documentation`)\\\\n 2. In the blank `.md` file that opens, enter the following prompt text:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nAct as an Amazon senior technical writer and documentation expert. Perform a comprehensive\\\\nanalysis of the documentation and code comments based on Amazon's documentation standards.\\\\n\\\\nConstraints:\\\\n- Unclear or missing API documentation\\\\n- Inconsistent commenting style and coverage\\\\n- Missing or inadequate inline code comments\\\\n- Poor explanation of complex business logic\\\\n- Lack of usage examples and code samples\\\\n- Missing error handling documentation\\\\n- Inadequate README and setup instructions\\\\n- Inconsistent terminology and naming conventions\\\\n- Lack of troubleshooting and FAQ sections\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n4. Save the file.\\\\n5. Reference it in chat using `@_prompt-name_` (e.g., `@documentation`) or type `@` and select Prompts, followed by your prompt name.\\\\nAmazon Q Developer will then analyze your workspace using the custom prompt criteria and provide specific feedback on documentation quality, commenting standards, and areas for improvement. Feel free to act on any of the recommendations provided or simply review them.\\\\nPrompts are saved in the `~/.aws/amazonq/prompts` folder and can be used across multiple conversations and projects.\\\\nNote\\\\nFor a comprehensive collection of community-contributed prompts, check out the scripts in [this package][10].\\\\n### Submit a code review[¶][7]\\\\n1. Save and commit your changes for both the service and model packages.\\\\n2. Create a new code review (CR) by running this command within your workspace:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ncr --new-review --all\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n3. Follow the printed URL to access the CR.\\\\n4. Add reviewers and a meaningful review description.\\\\n5. Publish the review for others to examine.\\\\n6. Address any feedback or concerns raised by reviewers. If you don’t have a team member to review your change, you can use the [#sb-onboarding-code-review-requests][11] Slack channel.\\\\n7. Once you’ve implemented any feedback and your CR has been approved, click the Merge button in the CR dashboard.\\\\n## Conclusion[¶][8]\\\\nIn this workshop, you explored the core concepts of the Coral framework and learned how to build and enhance a Coral service. Specifically, you can now:\\\\n* Describe the model-first development approach used in Coral.\\\\n* Provision a new Coral service and interact with it using the Coral Explorer.\\\\n* Add and modify Coral service components.\\\\n* Leverage Amazon Q Developer to help develop Coral services by understanding project structure, adding operations, adding error handling, adding tests, adding and analyzing metrics, and more.\\\\nTo learn more about Coral services, also check out [BT112][12], which covers Coral Lambda Endpoint (CLE) development, as well as [BT120][13], where you’ll dive deeper into the inner workings of the Coral framework.\\\\n**This is the end of BT111: Coral for Java Web Services**. If you’re here because you’re taking the Software Builder Onboarding on Amazon Learn, [be sure to return there][14] to take the course survey and complete the course.\\\\nNext page:[Builder Tools 112: Coral for Java Lambda web services][12]Previous page:[BT111: Handle errors in a Coral service][15]\\\\n[1]: #bt111-use-coral-metrics\\\\n[2]: #learning-objectives\\\\n[3]: #access-the-framework-created-metrics\\\\n[4]: #explore-the-emitted-metrics\\\\n[5]: #get-your-changes-reviewed-one-last-time\\\\n[6]: #create-and-use-a-custom-prompt\\\\n[7]: #submit-a-code-review\\\\n[8]: #conclusion\\\\n[9]: ../_images/BT111-Explore-the-emitted-metrics.png\\\\n[10]: https://code.amazon.com/packages/AmazonBuilderGenAIPowerUsersQContext/trees/mainline/--/scripts\\\\n[11]: https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C03LU75HZC5\\\\n[12]: ../bt112/\\\\n[13]: ../bt120/\\\\n[14]: https://atoz.amazon.work/learn/trainings/TURLERN20250212223129602dbbd9?lms=LEARN\\\\n[15]: ../bt111-handle-errors-in-a-coral-service/\\\"}}\"}],\"totalResults\":3352,\"currentPage\":null}}"}]}]},"uuid":"eb5ac082-f22e-4c06-a5fd-a3dbe914e4ad","timestamp":"2025-08-25T23:32:37.241Z","toolUseResult":[{"type":"text","text":"{\"content\":{\"results\":[{\"url\":\"https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/learning/bt111-add-a-member-to-the-model/\",\"displayTitle\":\"BT111: Add a member to the model\",\"domain\":\"builder_hub\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1755820800000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":1,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"/java/com/amazon/bt111_username_/activity/BeerActivity.java`, add the following line:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nBeer beerWithAssignedId = new Beer.Builder()\\\\n .withBeerId(NEXT_BEER_ID.getAndIncrement())\\\\n .withName(inBeer.getName())\\\\n .withDescription(inBeer.getDescription())\\\\n .withBeerCompanyName(inBeer.getBeerCompanyName())\\\\n .withBeerTypeName(inBeer.getBeerTypeName())\\\\n .withPriceInDollars(inBeer.getPriceInDollars())\\\\n .build();\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n5. Now that you’ve updated the Smithy model, run:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-recursive-cmd --allPackages brazil-build\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nThis will trigger the build process to regenerate all the Coral artifacts based on the updated Smithy model.\\\\nNote\\\\nIf you notice that the `withPriceInDollars` and `getPriceInDollars` methods in your IDE are unresolved:\\\\n* IntelliJ: From the main menu, run Brazil ‣ Sync From Workspace (Enhanced) to resolve them.\\\\n* VS Code: From the main menu, select View ‣ Command Palette… Then search `bemol` and select Run bemol to resolve dependencies.\\\\n## Amazon Q Developer context commands[¶][4]\\\\nNow that you’ve made changes to your model, explore how to use Amazon Q Developer’s context commands to analyze your code more effectively. When chatting with it in your IDE, you can provide additional context like files and folders to get more tailored answers.\\\\nYou can provide context in two ways:\\\\n* **Explicitly** using `@` commands in the chat window.\\\\n* **Automatically** through pre-configured project settings.\\\\nAfter Amazon Q Developer generates an answer, it shows the files it used as context in a dropdown above the response.\\\\n### Explicit context with `@` commands[¶][5]\\\\nType `@` in the chat to access these context options:\\\\n* `@workspace` - Analyzes your entire project workspace (requires setup, covered in the next section)\\\\n* `@file` - References specific files for targeted analysis\\\\n* `@folder` - Includes entire directories in the context\\\\n* `@code` - References classes, functions, and variables from your project\\\\n* `@prompt` - Uses saved prompts as context (requires setup, covered later in this workshop)\\\\nIn this module, you’ll use `@workspace` to analyze all your BT111 project files when verifying the model changes.\\\\n#### Set up workspace context[¶][6]\\\\n1. Click Amazon Q at the bottom of your IDE.\\\\n2. Select Open Settings from the Amazon Q task bar that opens.\\\\n3. Click the box next to Workspace Index.\\\\n### Automatic context[¶][7]\\\\nAmazon Q Developer can automatically use context you’ve set up outside of chat:\\\\n* **Project rules** - Automatically applied rules you define for your project\\\\n* **Active file** - The currently open and visible file in your editor is automatically included as context\\\\n* **Customizations** - Repository-based context for enhanced suggestions (more information on customizations found [HERE][11])\\\\n#### Set up a project rule[¶][8]\\\\nProject rules can be used to assist with consistent code quality and style across your team. These rules are automatically applied to all Amazon Q Developer interactions within your project and provide context-aware suggestions that align with your coding standards. In this section, you’ll create a rule that enforces style and syntax standards for your Coral service.\\\\n1. In your IDE, open the Amazon Q chat panel.\\\\n2. In the input box, click the Rules button.\\\\n3. Select Create new rule.\\\\n4. In the dialog that appears, enter a name for your rule (e.g., `style`).\\\\nThis will create a Markdown file with that name in your project’s `_project-root_/.amazonq/rules` folder.\\\\n5. Add the following rule content in the editor:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nAll Java code in this Coral service must adhere to the following style guidelines:\\\\n\\\\n1. Use 4 spaces for indentation, never tabs.\\\\n2. Limit line length to 120 characters.\\\\n3. Lines should have no trailing spaces.\\\\n4. Include type hints (via Java Generics) for all method parameters and return values.\\\\n5. Imports should be organized into sections (standard library, third-party, local) and alphabetized.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n6. Save the file.\\\\nOnce saved, this rule will automatically influence Amazon Q Developer’s responses when you ask questions about your BT111 project.\\\\nTip\\\\nYou can copy and paste existing coding style documentation from your team or organization (such as Amazon’s internal coding standards) directly into project rules. This allows Amazon Q Developer to automatically follow your established conventions without needing to recreate them from scratch.\\\\n## Verify changes in the generated code[¶][9]\\\\nSince your build was completed successfully, you can inspect the generated code to confirm the new `priceInDollars` member was added. To verify that the code generation worked correctly, open a Amazon Q Developer chat window and ask:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n@workspace Search all generated classes and check each one for a priceInDollars field.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nThis will help you confirm that the new member was properly generated across all relevant files. You can also manually open the `Beer.java` file in your service package to confirm (use the search function in your IDE):\\\\n(`BT111_username_/build/private/gradle/generated/sources/annotationProcessor/java/main/com/amazon/bt111_username_/Beer.java`)\\\\nYou should see something like this:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nprotected int priceInDollars;\\\\n/**\\\\n* Sets the value of the field \\\\\\\"priceInDollars\\\\\\\" to be used for the constructed object.\\\\n* @param priceInDollars\\\\n* The value of the \\\\\\\"priceInDollars\\\\\\\" field.\\\\n* @return\\\\n* This builder.\\\\n*/\\\\npublic Builder withPriceInDollars(int priceInDollars) {\\\\n this.priceInDollars = priceInDollars;\\\\n return this;\\\\n}\\\\n/**\\\\n* Sets the fields of the given instances to the corresponding values recorded when calling the \\\\\\\"with\\\\\\\" methods.\\\\n* @param instance\\\\n* The instance to be populated.\\\\n*/\\\\nprotected void populate(Beer instance) {\\\\n instance.setBeerId(this.beerId);\\\\n instance.setName(this.name);\\\\n instance.setDescription(this.description);\\\\n instance.setBeerCompanyName(this.beerCompanyName);\\\\n instance.setBeerTypeName(this.beerTypeName);\\\\n instance.setPriceInDollars(this.priceInDollars);\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n## Test the updated model using the Coral Explorer[¶][10]\\\\n1. In the service package (`src/BT111_username_`), run the server with:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-build server\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n2. Navigate to `http://_cloud-desktop-hostname_:8080/explorer/index.html` and refresh the page. You may need to perform a hard refresh with cmd+shift+R (macOS) or ctrl+shift+R (Ubuntu or Windows).\\\\n3. Click the CreateBeer link on the left. You should now see the new `priceInDollars` member in the Request Data field.\\\\n4. Change the values of each member and click the Call CreateBeer button to see `priceInDollars` in the response.\\\\nGreat job adding a new member to your model.

Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with AmazonJavaFormat\\\\n# Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with AmazonJavaFormat[¶][1]\\\\n* [Configuration][2]\\\\n* [Usage][3]\\\\n * [Applying PeruGradleJavaPresets with Spotless][4]\\\\n * [Overriding the default Spotless and AmazonJavaFormat settings][5]\\\\n  * [Overriding the default Spotless settings][6]\\\\n  * [Overriding the default AmazonJavaFormat settings][7]\\\\n* [Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with other supported tools][8]\\\\nThis page provides instructions on how to use the [PeruGradleJavaPresets][9] plugin with [AmazonJavaFormat][10] utilizing [Spotless][11].\\\\nImportant\\\\nPlease read [Using code quality tools with PeruGradleJavaPresets][12] before reading this page. It has general instructions and prerequisites on using the PeruGradleJavaPresets plugin.\\\\n## Configuration[¶][2]\\\\nPeruGradleJavaPresets provides the following default settings for Spotless:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nspotless {\\\\n   encoding(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)\\\\n\\\\n   java {\\\\n      // excludes generated source files inside the build, target, generated and generated-src directories\\\\n      targetExclude(\\\\\\\"**/build/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/target/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/generated/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/generated-src/**\\\\\\\");\\\\n      // applies Amazon Java code style\\\\n      addStep(createAmazonJavaFormatStep(\\\\\\\"AMAZON\\\\\\\"))\\\\n\\\\n      // fixes annotations formatting for inline type annotations\\\\n      formatAnnotations()\\\\n      trimTrailingWhitespace()\\\\n      endWithNewline()\\\\n   }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n`isEnforceCheck` is set to `false` if the build is on the build fleet. Otherwise, it is set to `true`.\\\\nPeruGradleJavaPresets provides the following default settings for AmazonJavaFormat:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nformatter.code.style=AMAZON\\\\nformatter.apply.on.build=false\\\\nformatter.fail.on.diff=true\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n`formatter.fail.on.diff` is set to `false` if the build is on the build fleet. Otherwise, it is set to `true`.\\\\nYou can specify your own Spotless and AmazonJavaFormat settings. Refer to [Overriding the default Spotless and AmazonJavaFormat settings][13] for more information.\\\\n## Usage[¶][3]\\\\n### Applying PeruGradleJavaPresets with Spotless[¶][4]\\\\nIn the `plugins` block of your `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`, add the Spotless Gradle plugin along with the PeruGradleJavaPresets plugin:\\\\nGroovybuild.gradle[¶][14]\\\\n```\\\\nplugins {\\\\n   // ...\\\\n   // other plugins\\\\n   // ...\\\\n\\\\n   id 'com.diffplug.spotless' version '6.+'\\\\n   id 'software.amazon.peru.java-presets' version '1.0.+'\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nKotlinbuild.gradle.kts[¶][15]\\\\n```\\\\nplugins {\\\\n   // ...\\\\n   // other plugins\\\\n   // ...\\\\n\\\\n   id(\\\\\\\"com.diffplug.spotless\\\\\\\") version \\\\\\\"6.+\\\\\\\"\\\\n   id(\\\\\\\"software.amazon.peru.java-presets\\\\\\\") version \\\\\\\"1.0.+\\\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n### Overriding the default Spotless and AmazonJavaFormat settings[¶][5]\\\\nIf you want to use your own Spotless or AmazonJavaFormat settings, you can override some or all of the settings provided by the PeruGradleJavaPresets plugin.\\\\n#### Overriding the default Spotless settings[¶][6]\\\\nOverriding default Spotless settings by using the `spotless` block in `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`. For example:\\\\nGroovybuild.gradle[¶][16]\\\\n```\\\\nspotless {\\\\n   setEnforceCheck(true)\\\\n\\\\n   java {\\\\n      target(\\\\\\\"**/src/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/generated-src/**\\\\\\\")\\\\n      targetExclude(\\\\\\\"**/build/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/target/**\\\\\\\")\\\\n   }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nKotlinbuild.gradle.kts[¶][17]\\\\n```\\\\nspotless {\\\\n   isEnforceCheck = true\\\\n\\\\n   java {\\\\n      target(\\\\\\\"**/src/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/generated-src/**\\\\\\\")\\\\n      targetExclude(\\\\\\\"**/build/**\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"**/target/**\\\\\\\")\\\\n   }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nSee the [Spotless Gradle plugin Quickstart instructions][18] for more information.\\\\nNote\\\\nIf you only need default Spotless settings provided by PeruGradleJavaPresets, you do not need to modify `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`.\\\\n#### Overriding the default AmazonJavaFormat settings[¶][7]\\\\nOverride default AmazonJavaFormat settings by specifying some Gradle properties in a `gradle.properties` file under the `/project_root`. The following properties are available:\\\\n|Property name|Type|Description|Default value|\\\\n|---|---|---|---|\\\\n|`formatter.code.style`|Enum|Set the code style to use. One of `AMAZON`, `PALANTIR`, `GOOGLE`, `AOSP`.|`AMAZON`|\\\\n|`formatter.apply.on.build`|Boolean|Set if AmazonJavaFormat formats your code automatically when the `assemble` task runs.|`false`|\\\\n|`formatter.fail.on.diff`|Boolean|Set if the build fails when the code is not formatted properly.

As you write code, Amazon Q Developer automatically generates suggestions based on your existing code and comments. Your personalized recommendations can vary in size and scope, ranging from a single line comment to fully formed functions. For Amazon builders, inline code recommendations from Amazon Q Developer can take advantage of the [Custom model][15], which has been customized on thousands of packages in Amazon’s internal codebase. For more information, see [Get inline suggestions with Amazon Q][16] in the _Amazon Q Developer User Guide_.\\\\nFor up to date language support, see [Language support in Amazon Q][17] in the _Amazon Q Developer User Guide_.\\\\n## Best practices[¶][2]\\\\nType lessAt the most basic level, Amazon Q Developer can be used as a supercharged auto-complete, significantly reducing your typing when writing individual lines or blocks of code. To use Amazon Q Developer in this way, just write code as you normally would. Amazon Q Developer will make automatic suggestions as you type. Accept suggestions when they are helpful, and ignore them when the are not.\\\\nMore context equals better suggestionsWhen starting out with Amazon Q Developer, it is common for builders to start with a blank file. But in some ways, this is the worst scenario for Amazon Q Developer to handle because it has very little context to play off of. In real-world usage, where a builder is using Amazon Q Developer on projects and files that already contain other code, you’ll notice a significant improvement in how helpful (and accurate) Amazon Q Developer becomes.\\\\nAdd import statements firstOne easy trick to give Amazon Q Developer context (even in new files) is to start by manually adding import statements at the top of the file, indicating which library Amazon Q Developer should should use in its implementation. For example, when writing a Python script that interacts with AWS services, start by importing `boto3` before prompting Amazon Q Developer to write code. You’ll typically get better results because Amazon Q Developer can detect your intentions already.\\\\nExperiment with different prompt engineering methodsPrompt engineering is an art and science of its own. Here are some quick tips to get you started:\\\\n* When writing code comments, use full sentences rather than sentence fragments.\\\\n* Code comments that read like API documentation often produce better results that code comments written in other styles.\\\\n* Don’t rely on code comments alone. Other code in a file provides valuable context that will make Amazon Q Developer’s suggestions more accurate. So just start writing code and you’ll see the suggestions improve.\\\\n* Amazon Q Developer is hesitant to suggest code that uses libraries or packages that aren’t referenced elsewhere in the file. Importing the libraries you want Amazon Q Developer to use will generate better suggestions.\\\\n* Don’t write comments that try to do too much. If your comment describes multiple steps or complex algorithms in detail it is unlikely that Amazon Q Developer will respond exactly the way you expect it to. It’s better to break the comment prompts into smaller pieces, each focused on a single task.\\\\n* Starting with a function signature, rather than a code comment, can be an effective way to get good suggestions from Amazon Q Developer.\\\\n* Use descriptive names for your classes, functions, and arguments. Descriptive names give Amazon Q Developer clearer context to work with.\\\\nSee [Usage examples][18] for different examples that have worked well for builders in different contexts.\\\\nExperiment with not using comment promptsType your code as you normally would, and see what suggestions Amazon Q Developer offers as it starts to understand your objectives through the code itself.\\\\nUse Amazon Q Developer in a real projectWhile Amazon Q Developer can sometimes (but not always) be impressive in trivial demo examples, it is much more valuable when it’s applied to a real project. Before drawing conclusions about Amazon Q Developer, try it on real-world code to get a more realistic sense of the value it provides.\\\\n## Usage examples[¶][3]\\\\nThese following usage examples should help you to get started using Amazon Q Developer for your own inline code suggestions. These are just illustrative samples to show you how to trigger the coding assistant for your own projects, and in many cases, you could find a more suitable library to implement the results of these examples.\\\\nRemember, it’s always up to you to verify that the suggested code works the way that you want it to.\\\\n### Generating functions[¶][4]\\\\n#### Automatically generating function bodies from signatures[¶][5]\\\\nSkilled programmers use clear, descriptive names for their functions and parameters. If you follow this practice in your own programming, Amazon Q Developer will have all the context it needs to implement many functions for you.\\\\nUser input (JavaScript):\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nfunction logMeanToConsole(numbers)\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nResult:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nfunction logMeanToConsole(numbers)\\\\n{\\\\n let sum = 0;\\\\n for (let i = 0; i {\\\\n if (typeof item === \\\\\\\"number\\\\\\\") {\\\\n return `#${item}`;\\\\n } else {\\\\n return `\\\\\\\"${item}\\\\\\\"`;\\\\n }\\\\n })\\\\n .join(\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\");\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n### Generating classes[¶][7]\\\\nYou can generate full or partial class implementations from a single code comment. The comment should describe the key properties and behaviors of the class. Simple descriptions are often all that is required.\\\\nUser input (TypeScript):\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n/**\\\\n * A folder has a name, children, and an optional parent. A child can't be added\\\\n * twice.\\\\n */\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nResult:\\\\nAfter writing the previous block comment, Amazon Q Developer provides multiple suggestions, including the following implementation, complete with documentation comments for each method.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n/**\\\\n * A folder has a name, children, and an optional parent. A child can't be added\\\\n * twice.\\\\n */\\\\nexport class Folder {\\\\n name: string;\\\\n children: Folder[];\\\\n parent?: Folder;\\\\n \\\\n constructor(name: string, parent?: Folder) {\\\\n this.name = name;\\\\n this.children = [];\\\\n this.parent = parent;\\\\n }\\\\n \\\\n /**\\\\n * Add a child to the folder.\\\\n * @param child The child to add.\\\\n * @returns True if the child was added, false if it was already present.\\\\n */\\\\n addChild(child: Folder): boolean {\\\\n if (this.children.includes(child)) {\\\\n return false;\\\\n }\\\\n this.children.push(child);\\\\n child.parent = this;\\\\n return true;\\\\n }\\\\n \\\\n /**\\\\n * Remove a child from the folder.\\\\n * @param child The child to remove.\\\\n * @returns True if the child was removed, false if it wasn't present.\\\\n */\\\\n removeChild(child: Folder): boolean {\\\\n const index = this.children.indexOf(child);\\\\n if (index === -1) {\\\\n return\"},{\"url\":\"https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/learning/bt112-test-your-service/\",\"displayTitle\":\"BT112: Test your Coral Lambda Endpoint service\",\"domain\":\"builder_hub\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1755820800000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":5,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"t\\\\n assertEquals(2, output.getString());\\\\n // Print the result for visibility\\\\n System.out.println(\\\\\\\"Word count: \\\\\\\" + output.getString());\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n3. Add a test method for the `TextTooLongException`. The following test validates that the `WordCount` operation correctly throws a `TextTooLongException` when the input text is longer than the allowed maximum:\\\\nAWS customers\\\\n```\\\\n@Test\\\\npublic void testTextTooLong() {\\\\n String input = \\\\\\\"Hello Lambda! Hello Lambda! Hello Lambda!\\\\\\\";\\\\n assertThrows(TextTooLongException.class, () -> {\\\\n WordCountCall call = client.newWordCountCall();\\\\n call.call(WordCountInput.builder().withString(input).build());\\\\n });\\\\n System.out.println(\\\\\\\"Input text exceeds maximum length!\\\\\\\");\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nSDO customers\\\\n```\\\\n@Test\\\\npublic void testTextTooLong() {\\\\n String input = \\\\\\\"Hello Lambda! Hello Lambda! Hello Lambda!\\\\\\\";\\\\n assertThrows(TextTooLongException.class, () -> {\\\\n WordCountCall call = CLIENT.newWordCountCall();\\\\n call.call(WordCountInput.builder().withString(input).build());\\\\n });\\\\n System.out.println(\\\\\\\"Input text exceeds maximum length!\\\\\\\");\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n4. Add the following import to the top of `SimpleIntegrationTest.java`:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nimport com.amazon.bt112_username_.impl.WordCountCall;\\\\n```\\\\n5. Update the `stage` and `region`: When running integration tests, you need to make sure that your test client is pointing to the correct environment where your service is deployed. This typically involves setting the appropriate stage (alpha, beta, gamma, prod, etc.) and AWS region.\\\\nYou can quickly find the values for these two variables in your Pipelines. You’ll want to set `stage` to the location of your integration tests (`\\\\\\\"alpha\\\\\\\"` in the example below) and `region` to where your service is deployed (`\\\\\\\"us-west-2\\\\\\\"` in this case). Using the wrong stage or region will cause your integration tests to fail, as they won’t be able to locate or communicate with your service.\\\\n![\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"][13]Open your application [Pipelines][14] to find these values and update accordingly.\\\\nAWS customers\\\\n```\\\\n@BeforeAll\\\\npublic void setup() throws Exception {\\\\n\\\\n String stage = \\\\\\\"alpha\\\\\\\";\\\\n if (stage == null) {\\\\n throw new RuntimeException(\\\\n \\\\\\\"Stage is not configured. It should be passed as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"STAGE\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" environment variable\\\\\\\"\\\\n );\\\\n }\\\\n\\\\n if (null == endpoint) {\\\\n synchronized (SimpleIntegrationTest.class) {\\\\n if (null == endpoint) {\\\\n String region = \\\\\\\"us-west-2\\\\\\\";\\\\n if (region == null) {\\\\n throw new RuntimeException(\\\\n \\\\\\\"AWS region is not configured. It should be passed as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"AWS_REGION\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\n + \\\\\\\"environment variable\\\\\\\"\\\\n );\\\\n }\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nSDO customers\\\\n```\\\\n@TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)\\\\npublic class SimpleIntegrationTest {\\\\n private static final BT112SDO3Client CLIENT;\\\\n private static final BT112SDO3Client NO_AUTH_CLIENT;\\\\n\\\\n static {\\\\n String stage = \\\\\\\"alpha\\\\\\\";\\\\n String region = \\\\\\\"us-west-2\\\\\\\";\\\\n\\\\n String qualifier = String.format(\\\\\\\"%s.%s\\\\\\\", stage, region);\\\\n ClientBuilder clientBuilder = new ClientBuilder();\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n6. Rebuild your project after first cleaning your workspace. Run:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil ws clean; brazil-recursive-cmd --allPackages brazil-build\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n## Initiate another code review[¶][6]\\\\nTo run your new tests, you’ll need to deploy your updated code to Lambda. Your integration tests will fail unless your Lambda function has been updated with the latest code. Since you’ve made some significant changes to your service, however, you’ll do this via a code review first. Deployment to Lambda will happen automatically after you merge into the main branch.\\\\n### Use Q CLI as a preliminary reviewer[¶][7]\\\\nBefore submitting your code review, it’s a good practice to have Amazon Q perform a preliminary review of your changes. This can help you catch potential issues and improve code quality before human reviewers examine your work.\\\\nTo use Q CLI as a preliminary reviewer:\\\\n1. In your terminal, run Q CLI with the following prompt:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nq chat \\\\\\\"Conduct a code review of this workspace\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nQ CLI will analyze your code and should provide feedback on:\\\\n * Code quality: Potential bugs, performance issues, or maintainability concerns\\\\n * Best practices: Adherence to Java coding standards and Amazon development guidelines\\\\n * Test coverage: Whether your integration tests adequately cover your new functionality\\\\n * Error handling: Proper exception handling and edge case coverage\\\\n\\\\n2. Prompt Q CLI to implement 1 or 2 of its suggested changes. Prioritize those that are both high-impact and easy to implement. Avoid making extensive changes that could introduce new issues or significantly delay your code review submission.\\\\n3. After implementing any selected improvements, prompt Q CLI to verify your project still builds successfully:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nVerify that my project builds successfully after these recent changes.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nFollow Q CLI’s guidance to run the appropriate build commands and resolve any build issues.\\\\nNote\\\\nIt is worth noting yet again that you should review each suggestion from Q CLI carefully. While Q CLI provides valuable insights, not all suggestions may be appropriate for your specific use case or development context. Always understand what each suggested change does and verify it aligns with your project’s requirements and coding standards before applying it. When in doubt, consult with your team or skip suggestions that you’re uncertain about.\\\\n### Submit your CR[¶][8]\\\\n1. Save and commit your changes for the Lambda (`BT112_username_`), model, and tests packages.\\\\n2. Create a new code review (CR) by running this command within your workspace:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ncr --new-review --all\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n3. Follow the printed URL to access the CR.\\\\n4. Add reviewers and a meaningful review description.\\\\n5. Publish the review for others to examine.\\\\n6. Address any feedback or concerns raised by reviewers. If you don’t have a team member to review your change, you can use the [#sb-onboarding-code-review-requests][15] Slack channel.\\\\n7. Once you’ve implemented any feedback and your CR has been approved, click the Merge button in the CR dashboard.\\\\n## Enable the integration tests[¶][9]\\\\nImportant\\\\nThis section of the workshop pertains to **SDO builders only**. If you are an AWS builder, please proceed to [Run the integration tests][16].\\\\nYou may have noticed your pipeline is now blocked due to integration test failures. This is because your service needs proper authentication and authorization configuration before the integration tests can successfully communicate with your deployed service.\\\\nIn this section, you’ll configure the Authentication, Authorization, and CloudAuth (AAA) settings for your service. This involves:\\\\n* Registering your new `WordCount` operation in the AAA system.\\\\n* Setting up the proper access permissions between your test client and service.\\\\n* Configuring IAM roles to allow local testing.\\\\n### Enable tests in your pipeline[¶][10]\\\\nTo successfully run the integration tests in your pipeline:\\\\n1. Open your [ServiceLens dashboard][17].\\\\n2. In the search bar at the top, enter and select the name of your app (`BT112_username_`).\\\\n3. Click the Services tab, followed by the name of your service under Service Name.\\\\n4. In top right, click the Request Access button.\\\\n![\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"][18]Note\\\\nIf you have an Add Dependency button instead of a Request Access button:\\\\n 1. Click the Add Dependency button.\\\\n 2. Select your service from the Service Name dropdown.\\\\n 3. Select WordCount from the Service Operations dropdown.\\\\n 4. Click the Submit button.\\\\n 5. Proceed to restart Hydra Tests in your pipeline (last step in this section).\\\\n5. In the popup, select the name of your application in the Client Application dropdown. An Action not supported message may appear; click the View in AAA button next to that message.\\\\n6. You should see your `Echo` operation selected and `WordCount` operation below that, unselected. Click the checkbox next to WordCount and enter a description in the field that appears.\\\\n![\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"][19]\\\\n7. Click the Update Request reply relationship button.\\\\n8. You may encounter a popup asking for a Consensus review ID. In this case:\\\\nCaution\\\\nWe’re using the Break Glass option here because this is a training course.

In this phase, the goal is to transition from guided experimentation to **seamless integration**.\\\\nYou’ll explore **complementary tools** that fill specific gaps, embed AI more deeply into regular workflows, and begin **capturing team knowledge**. AI moves from being a cool experiment to a **trusted productivity multiplier**.\\\\n## Step 1: Expanded tool usage[¶][4]\\\\n**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours\\\\n**Why it matters**: Teams often benefit from pairing one primary tool with 1-2 complementary tools, tailored to their workflow needs.\\\\nUse insights from Phase 1 to decide whether expanding your toolset makes sense. If current tools fall short in key areas, thoughtfully introduce additional ones - but avoid overload.\\\\n**How to do this**:\\\\n1. Review feedback from Phase 1 to identify pain points or capability gaps.\\\\n2. Introduce 1-2 complementary tools to fill those gaps.\\\\n * Start with our [Complementary Tool Selection Matrix Template][12].\\\\n * Example: For automated code upgrades, explore [Ironhide][13] (Amazon Q Developer-based CLI for tasks like Java 8 → 17 migrations)\\\\n\\\\n3. Host short demos (15-30 mins) focused on real, practical applications.\\\\n4. Share getting-started guides or docs for new tools.\\\\n5. Track which tool pairings work best for specific scenarios.\\\\nNote\\\\nDon’t introduce too many tools at once. One core tool + one well-chosen complement = the sweet spot.\\\\n## Step 2: Workflow integration[¶][5]\\\\n**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours over 1-2 weeks\\\\n**Why it matters**: Sustained adoption happens when tools become part of _how you work_, not extra effort.\\\\nMove beyond individual tasks. This step is about integrating AI tools into your team’s core development processes and lifecycle - planning, building, testing, releasing, monitoring, documenting, and more.\\\\n**How to do this**:\\\\n1. Identify natural integration points:\\\\n * Planning: Break down stories, estimate complexity with AI\\\\n * Development: Use AI in IDEs and code review processes\\\\n * Testing: Generate and maintain tests with AI\\\\n * Docs: Set AI-assisted documentation updates as a standard step\\\\n * Maintenance: Use AI for debugging and refactoring patterns\\\\n\\\\n2. Block 2-3 hours/week of protected time for team members to apply and refine these integrations\\\\n3. Organize pair programming sessions, pairing experienced users with newer adopters\\\\n4. Begin tracking workflow-level metrics, not just tool usage\\\\n5. Address any obstacles that emerge in applying tools to real workflow challenges\\\\nNote\\\\nDon’t add steps - enhance existing ones. A “Pre-review with AI” step before code reviews improves code quality and cuts review cycles.\\\\n## Step 3: Knowledge sharing \\\\\\\\(ongoing\\\\\\\\)[¶][6]\\\\n**Estimated effort**: 30-60 mins to set up, then ongoing\\\\n**Why it matters**: What your team learns in real time is gold. Capture it before it disappears.\\\\nKnowledge sharing becomes critical in this phase to scale success, avoid duplication, and accelerate learning across the team and org.\\\\n**How to do this**:\\\\n1. Choose a central place to collect insights. Options to consider:\\\\n * Creating a dedicated “AI Playbook” page on your team wiki\\\\n * Starting a Quip document with sections for different use cases\\\\n * Creating a GitFarm repo with examples and prompt libraries\\\\n\\\\n2. Establish lightweight documentation standards. Important aspects include:\\\\n * Use before/after examples\\\\n * Capture both wins and limitations\\\\n * Apply consistent formatting so it’s easy to browse\\\\n\\\\n3. Schedule regular share-outs. Formats might include:\\\\n * 10-min AI segment in team meetings\\\\n * Monthly lunch & learns\\\\n * “AI Tip of the Week” posts\\\\n\\\\n4. Enable cross-team learning. Try to:\\\\n * Post in [#amazon-builder-genai-power-users][14]\\\\n * Add content to org-level knowledge hubs\\\\n * Present in cross-team technical demos or AMAs\\\\n * Run occasional exchange sessions with other teams\\\\n\\\\nNote\\\\nUse AI tools themselves to help with documentation. For example, have Amazon Q Developer generate initial documentation of a successful pattern that you can then refine.\\\\n## Troubleshooting[¶][7]\\\\n**Team members using tools inconsistently?**Integrate AI tools into existing workflow rituals - for example, start code reviews by having Amazon Q Developer analyze the code first, or begin sprint planning with AI-assisted task breakdown. Designate specific “AI-assisted days” where the team collectively focuses on using the tools. Create usage challenges tied to team goals.\\\\n**Struggling to move beyond basic use cases?**Schedule a focused workshop specifically on advanced use cases. Invite an experienced user from another team to demonstrate their workflows. Use the “pair and share” technique where two developers work together to solve a complex problem with AI assistance. Review the [QDevTips Library][15] for more advanced examples from other teams.\\\\n**Different team members developing different approaches?**Diversity in approaches is valuable during this phase - encourage experimentation while capturing the different techniques. Create a weekly share-out where team members demonstrate their unique approaches. After 2-3 weeks of divergent exploration, hold a consolidation session to identify best practices that the team wants to standardize.\\\\n**Documentation creating excess overhead?**Use lightweight documentation approaches like a shared Slack channel with threaded conversations for different use cases. Create a simple template for knowledge-sharing that team members can complete in 5 minutes or less. Consider using AI tools themselves to help document the process - for example, using Amazon Q Developer to generate documentation about how the team is using Amazon Q Developer.\\\\n**Team enthusiasm waning in Phase 2?**Refresh interest by highlighting concrete metrics from Phase 1, celebrating early wins, and introducing new use cases. Sometimes teams need to see the cumulative impact of their efforts to maintain motivation. Consider friendly competition or recognition for innovative applications to maintain momentum.\\\\n## Resources[¶][8]\\\\n* [Template: Complementary Tool Selection Matrix][12]\\\\n* [Ironhide][13]\\\\n* [QDevTips Library][15]\\\\n* [#amazon-builder-genai-power-users][14]\\\\nNext page:[Phase 3: Measure & adjust][16]Previous page:[Phase 1: Set up & first wins][17]\\\\n[1]: #phase-2-expand-integrate\\\\n[2]: #key-steps\\\\n[3]: #why-phase-2-matters\\\\n[4]: #step-1-expanded-tool-usage\\\\n[5]: #step-2-workflow-integration\\\\n[6]: #step-3-knowledge-sharing-ongoing\\\\n[7]: #troubleshooting\\\\n[8]: #resources\\\\n[9]: #expanded-tool-usage\\\\n[10]: #workflow-integration\\\\n[11]: #knowledge-sharing\\\\n[12]: https://quip-amazon.com/O74VAOgp8R2u/Template-Complementary-Tool-Selection-Matrix\\\\n[13]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/ironhide/index.html\\\\n[14]: https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C08GJKNC3KM\\\\n[15]: https://builderhub.corp.amazon.com/blog/tag/qdevtips\\\\n[16]: ../adoption-phase3/\\\\n[17]: ../adoption-phase1/\\\"}}\"},{\"url\":\"https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/brazil/user-guide/tools-brazil-path/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Brazil path\",\"domain\":\"builder_hub\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1755820800000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":7,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"d will then fail.\\\\n## Variables[¶][7]\\\\nThere are two types of variables that you’ll be working with:\\\\n* [Simple variables][28]\\\\n* [Complex Variables][29]\\\\n### Simple variables[¶][8]\\\\n_Simple_ variables are those whose values are calculated from the current package—they are not affected by the dependency graph.\\\\nHere are the simple variables you can use with **brazil-path**. They always consider the dependencies of the _current package only_, they cannot be scoped as a complex variable can be.\\\\n||\\\\n||\\\\n||\\\\n||\\\\n|Name|Description|Example output|\\\\n|`package-build-root`|The path to the current package’s `build` directory (where package artifacts will be produced).|`/home/ANT.AMAZON.COM/username/workplace/my-workpace/build/MyPackage/MyPackage-1.0/RHEL5_64/DEV.STD.PTHREAD/build`|\\\\n|`package-major-version`|The `interfaces` value (AKA _major version_) of the current package.|`1.0`|\\\\n|`package-name`|The name of the current package.|`MyPackage`|\\\\n|`package-name-full-version`|The current package’s name and full version.|`MyPackage-1.0.x.x`|\\\\n|`package-src-root`|The path to the current package’s source directory.|`/home/ANT.AMAZON.COM/username/workplace/my-workspace/src/MyPackage`|\\\\n|`workspace-root`|The path to the current workspace root.|`/home/ANT.AMAZON.COM/username/workplace/my-workspace`|\\\\n\\\\n### Complex Variables[¶][9]\\\\n_Complex_ variables are a bit more…complex. Complex variables have a two-part name:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n_graph_name.recipe_name_\\\\n```\\\\nWhere:\\\\n* `_graph_name_` represents the _scope_ that’s used by the _recipe_. See [Brazil path graph][30] to see what values are supported.\\\\n* `_recipe_name_` represents the type of information to retrieve from the _graph_ provided. See [Brazil path recipes][27] to see what values are supported.\\\\nTo print out the complete list of graphs and recipes available on the command-line, use:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path -list\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n## Formatting output[¶][10]\\\\nThe output format of **brazil-path** is controlled by the optional `--format` argument which can override the default formatting behavior.\\\\n### Default format[¶][11]\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path _variable_\\\\n```\\\\nIn the absence of the `--format` option, brazil-path will simply dump raw values produced by the requested recipe to stdout. The intent here is to make it easy to embed these calls into shell scripts.\\\\nHowever, there is a more efficient way of utilizing **brazil-path** from a shell script:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nexport PERL5LIB=$(brazil-path all.perllib)\\\\n\\\\nfor file in $(brazil-path all.config)\\\\ndo\\\\n ls -l $file\\\\ndone\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nImportant\\\\n**brazil-path** will only accept one variable name in its argument list when using default format mode.\\\\n### –format=json[¶][12]\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path --format=json _ [ ...]_\\\\n```\\\\nReturns JSON data format compatible with most JSON parsers.\\\\n* You can use it from Java using `org.json.JSONObject(java.lang.Stringsource)`\\\\n* In Python, you can use `importjson;json.loads(string)`\\\\nExample:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path --format=json build.classpath run.classpath\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nOutput:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\\\\"build.classpath\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\".../lib/BrazilDependencyResolver.jar:.../lib/BrazilWorkspaceLib.jar:...\\\\\\\",\\\\n \\\\\\\"run.classpath\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\".../lib/BrazilPackageCacher.jar:.../lib/BrazilCommonJavaTypes.jar:...\\\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n### –format=make[¶][13]\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path --format=make [ ...]\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n* Compatible with GNU Make\\\\n* Assumes a set of constants is already defined\\\\n* Supports multiple variables\\\\nAny variable name or value that contains any “special” characters will be translated according to the following table:\\\\n|Character|Will be translated to|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|`(`|`$(L_PAREN)`|\\\\n|`)`|`$(R_PAREN)`|\\\\n|`\\\\\\\\n`|`$(NEWLINE)`|\\\\n|`\\\\\\\\t`|`$(TAB)`|\\\\n|`#`|`$(POUND)`|\\\\n|`,`|`$(COMMA)`|\\\\n|`\\\\\\\\x20`|`$(SPACE)`|\\\\n\\\\nExample:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path --format=make pkg.bin pkg.lib\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nOutput:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\npkg.bin:=/workplace/foo/build/YourPackage/YourPackage-1.0/X86_LINUX_GCC32_GLIBC23/DEV.STD.PTHREAD/build/bin\\\\npkg.lib:=/workplace/foo/build/YourPackage/YourPackage-1.0/X86_LINUX_GCC32_GLIBC23/DEV.STD.PTHREAD/build/lib\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n### –format=properties[¶][14]\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path --format=properties _ [ ...]_\\\\n```\\\\n* Compatible with the Java standard property parser. You can use it from Java using `java.util.Properties#load`.\\\\nExample:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path --format=properties build.classpath run.classpath\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nOutput (generated by brazil-path ‘properties’ formatter):\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n#Mon Nov 23 09:12:55 PST 2009\\\\nrun.classpath=.../lib/BrazilServiceToolkit.jar\\\\\\\\:.../lib/commons-betwixt-20061229.jar\\\\\\\\:...\\\\nbuild.classpath=.../lib/commons-betwixt-20061229.jar\\\\\\\\:.../lib/commons-beanutils.jar\\\\\\\\:...\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n### –format=perl[¶][15]\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path --format=perl _ [ ...]_\\\\n```\\\\n* Compatible with the Perl `eval()` built-in fuction.\\\\nExample:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path --format=perl build.classpath run.classpath\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nOutput (generated by brazil-path ‘perl’ formatter using the ISO-8859-1 character set):\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\n'build.classpath' => '.../lib/commons-betwixt-20061229.jar:.../lib/commons-beanutils.jar:...',\\\\n'run.classpath' => '.../lib/BrazilServiceToolkit.jar:.../lib/commons-betwixt-20061229.jar:...',\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n### –format=shell[¶][16]\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path --format=shell --prefix=__ __ _[ ...]_\\\\n```\\\\n* Generates a shell function named via the parameter. This function can later be used to fetch the value of an individual variable. Using brazil-path from a shell this way is more efficient if you have multiple variables that you want to fetch, since the dependency closure cache will be effective, and you avoid the cost of starting up the JVM on each invocation.\\\\nExample:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-path --format=shell --prefix=dapath build.classpath run.classpath\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nOutput (generated by **brazil-path** ‘shell’ formatter using the ISO-8859-1 character set):\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nfunction dapath () {\\\\n [ \\\\\\\"$1\\\\\\\" = 'build.classpath' ] && echo '.../lib/commons-betwixt-20061229.jar:.../lib/commons-beanutils.jar:...' && exit\\\\n [ \\\\\\\"$1\\\\\\\" = 'run.classpath' ] && echo '.../lib/BrazilServiceToolkit.jar:.../lib/commons-betwixt-20061229.jar:...' && exit\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nTo use, this from the shell, it is easiest to use the built-in `eval` function as such:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nset -e\\\\neval_me=\\\\\\\"$(brazil-path -format=shell -prefix=dapath build.classpath run.classpath)\\\\\\\"\\\\neval \\\\\\\"$eval_me\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nNote\\\\nIt is important to do this as two separate operations, so that a failure in **brazil-path** will cause the shell script to fail.\\\\nTo use dapath function, always enclose it in $() as such:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\necho build.classpath=\\\\\\\"$(dapath build.classpath)\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n`dapath` needs to be ran in a sub-shell since it uses the builtin exit function. This will be changed in the future so that instead of using exit it uses return.\\\\nAs a workaround, you can wrap the poorly-behaved output of `brazil-path` into a well-behaved shell function:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbroken_brazil_path_src=$( \\\\\\\\\\\\n brazil-path --format shell --prefix broken_brazil_path \\\\\\\\\\\\n build.classpath \\\\\\\\\\\\n run.classpath # etc\\\\n)\\\\neval \\\\\\\"$broken_brazil_path_src\\\\\\\"\\\\nfunction brazil-path-cached() {\\\\n # The builtin one uses `exit`, so needs a subshell. It indicates failures\\\\n # by not exiting at all (!?).\\\\n (broken_brazil_path \\\\\\\"$1\\\\\\\"; exit 1)\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n**brazil-path-cached\\\\\\\\`** does not need to be run in a subshell, and is capable of indicating a failure, unlike the output of `brazil-path--formatshell`.\\\\n## Extending and customizing brazil-path[¶][17]\\\\nEvery effort has been made to make **brazil-path** easily extensible. Consult the following documents to learn how to:\\\\n* Write custom graphs (_need a link here!_)\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> Todo\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> Fix this.

integration with other Amazon services. Here are common use cases for Java:\\\\n  Web servicesJava is the language chosen for Amazon Software Builder Experience (ASBX)’s Golden Paths for building web services with [Coral][11]:\\\\n* 🏆  [Coral Service on Lambda \\\\\\\\(Brazil\\\\\\\\)][12]\\\\n* 🏆  [Coral Service on Fargate \\\\\\\\(Brazil\\\\\\\\)][13]\\\\nFor more information about developing web services, see [Building web services][14].\\\\n   Mobile developmentJava is the preferred language for [Building Android applications][15].\\\\nFor more information about developing mobile apps, see [Building mobile applications][16].\\\\nNote\\\\nApplications marked with “🏆” are [ASBX Golden Paths][17], and represent Amazon’s _best practices_ in tooling, architecture, and configuration.\\\\n## IDEs and setup[¶][3]\\\\n1. **Set up your IDE**\\\\nSupported IDEs at Amazon are [IntelliJ IDEA][18] and [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)][19]. Instructions to install either are provided on the [IDE and plugin setup][20] page.\\\\nYou should also install the suggested plugin for integration with Amazon’s development tools, depending on the IDE you’re using:\\\\n * For IntelliJ, use [Black Caiman][21].\\\\n * For VS Code, use [Viceroy][22].\\\\n\\\\n2. **Set up a JDK**\\\\nNote\\\\n[AxE][23] handles the installation of runtimes for Java, Python, and Node.js, as well their dependencies (such as **mise**) for macOS and Cloud Desktop (see [the list here][24]). To get those and the most commonly used tools, run:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\naxe init builder-tools\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nIf you’ve configured your system with AxE, then language runtimes have already been set up; you can **skip this section**!\\\\nYou will need a Java/JDK runtime set up on your development system(s). Visit one (or both) of the following pages to install a JDK development environment, based on the [dependency model][25] you’ll be using:\\\\n * [Local Java setup for Brazil][26]\\\\n * [Local Java setup for Peru][27]\\\\n\\\\n3. (Optional) **Developing a mobile application?**\\\\nIf you are building an Android application, you should also follow [Set up your laptop for Android development][28] in the _Electric Company User Guide_.\\\\n## Building and packaging Java code[¶][4]\\\\nThe techniques you’ll use for building and packaging code at Amazon will depend on the [dependency model][25] you’ll be using for your code.\\\\n### Brazil development[¶][5]\\\\n* [Using Java with the Brazil dependency model][29]\\\\n### Peru development[¶][6]\\\\n* [Using Java with the Peru dependency model][30]\\\\n * [Gradle][31]\\\\n * [Maven][32]\\\\n\\\\n## Running Java services[¶][7]\\\\n* [JVM best practices][33]\\\\n * [JVM availability best practices][34]\\\\n * [Heap occupancy best practices][35]\\\\n * [Using the G1 garbage collector][36]\\\\n  * [Migrating to the G1 garbage collector][37]\\\\n  * [Tuning the G1 garbage collector][38]\\\\n  * [Dealing with Humongous objects in G1][39]\\\\n\\\\n * [Interpreting GC logs][40]\\\\n * [Investigating memory shortage][41]\\\\n * [JVM native memory explained][42]\\\\n * [Supporting fast zlib implementations][43]\\\\n\\\\n## Additional guides[¶][8]\\\\n* [Peru for Java Quickstart][44]\\\\n## Learning about Java[¶][9]\\\\n* Learn more about [Amazon Corretto][45].\\\\n## Support[¶][10]\\\\nGeneral support for Java developers* Visit the [Amazon Corretto][45] website.\\\\n* Search for answers on Sage using the [Java][46] tag.\\\\n* Join the [#java][47] Slack channel for general discussion of Java.\\\\n* Join the [#openjdk-help][48] Slack channel for specific help with OpenJDK.\\\\n* Subscribe to the [java-dev][49] email list.\\\\n* For a consultation with the JDK team, sign up for office hours:\\\\n * [JDK office hours \\\\\\\\(US\\\\\\\\)][50]\\\\n * [JDK office hours \\\\\\\\(Europe\\\\\\\\)][51]\\\\n\\\\nNext page:[Using Java with the Brazil dependency model][29]\\\\n[1]: #java\\\\n[2]: #use-cases\\\\n[3]: #setup\\\\n[4]: #building-and-packaging-java-code\\\\n[5]: #brazil-development\\\\n[6]: #peru-development\\\\n[7]: #running-java-services\\\\n[8]: #additional-guides\\\\n[9]: #learning-about-java\\\\n[10]: #support\\\\n[11]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/coral/index.html\\\\n[12]: https://create.hub.amazon.dev/source-applications/cle-java-lambda\\\\n[13]: https://create.hub.amazon.dev/source-applications/coral-fargate\\\\n[14]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/web-services/index.html\\\\n[15]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/electric-company/user-guide/develop-mobile-android.html\\\\n[16]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/mobile/index.html\\\\n[17]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/golden-path/index.html\\\\n[18]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/dev-setup/ide-plugin-setup.html#ide-setup-intellij\\\\n[19]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/dev-setup/ide-plugin-setup.html#ide-setup-vs-code\\\\n[20]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/dev-setup/ide-plugin-setup.html\\\\n[21]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/black-caiman/user-guide/getting-started.html\\\\n[22]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/viceroy/index.html#getting-started\\\\n[23]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/axe/index.html\\\\n[24]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/axe/user-guide/init-builder-tools.html\\\\n[25]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/brazil/user-guide/dependency-models-and-package-managers.html\\\\n[26]: brazil/#brazil-local-setup\\\\n[27]: peru/#peru-local-setup\\\\n[28]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/electric-company/user-guide/develop-mobile-android-setup.html\\\\n[29]: brazil/\\\\n[30]: peru/\\\\n[31]: peru-gradle/\\\\n[32]: peru-maven/\\\\n[33]: jvm-best-practices/\\\\n[34]: jvm-best-practices-availability/\\\\n[35]: jvm-best-practices-heap-occupancy/\\\\n[36]: jvm-best-practices-g1/\\\\n[37]: jvm-best-practices-g1-migrating/\\\\n[38]: jvm-best-practices-g1-tuning-sop/\\\\n[39]: jvm-best-practices-g1-humongous-objects/\\\\n[40]: jvm-best-practices-gc-log-sops/\\\\n[41]: jvm-best-practices-memory-usage-sop/\\\\n[42]: jvm-best-practices-native-memory/\\\\n[43]: jvm-best-practices-fast-zlib-implementations/\\\\n[44]: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/brazil/peru-java-quickstart/index.html\\\\n[45]: https://aws.amazon.com/corretto\\\\n[46]: https://sage.amazon.dev/tags/java\\\\n[47]: https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C017Z68H0D9\\\\n[48]: https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C0184TZKTBN\\\\n[49]: https://unity.email.amazon.dev/list-archive/list/java-dev\\\\n[50]: https://office-hour-scheduler.tools.aws.dev/schedule/a8662172-dd8f-456f-bff1-39367db44afe\\\\n[51]: https://office-hour-scheduler.tools.aws.dev/schedule/41d72e33-1951-4802-9ee5-ebf8243312e2\\\"}}\"},{\"url\":\"https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/docs/event-consumers/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Building event consumers\",\"domain\":\"builder_hub\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1755820800000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":9,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\" using for existing services and avoid using for new services.

Ask questions like:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nWhat business metrics should I record in this function to measure total revenue?\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nOr:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nWhat business metrics should I record for accounting purposes?\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nAmazon Q Developer will suggest relevant metrics based on your service’s business logic and industry best practices.\\\\n## Explore the emitted metrics[¶][4]\\\\nWhile the Coral Explorer can be used to test the API, it does not display emitted metrics. Instead, metrics are written to a file in your local development environment.\\\\n1. Restart your service with:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nbrazil-build server\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n2. Create a beer and then update its price.\\\\n3. After the operations have completed, search for a file in your project named `metrics.log._current_date_and_time_`. You should be able to find it in the `BT111_username_/src/BT111_username_/build/private/var/output/logs/` directory. This file will contain the custom metrics you’ve emitted from the `BeerActivity` class.\\\\nUse the Find command (Ctrl+F or Command+F) to wade through the “noise” and find your metric.\\\\n![\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"][9]\\\\n4. Use Amazon Q Developer for increased metrics visibility and insights:\\\\n 1. Open the Amazon Q chat panel and with the proper metrics file set as context, ask:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nFind and analyze the Beer Created and Price Updated metrics.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nAmazon Q Developer will scan the `metrics.log` file to locate your custom metrics and filter out noise. It should identify usage patterns and correlate beer creation with price updates, explain what metric patterns indicate healthy service behavior, and compare the logged metrics against your `BeerActivity` implementation. It may even generate an automated Python script to assist with extracting metrics.\\\\nNote\\\\nYou can control noisy output (such as Python scripts or methods to analyze data instead of the analysis itself) by specifying your preference in the prompt. For example, add:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nProvide analysis only, no code.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nTo the end of your prompt to get direct insights rather than generated scripts.\\\\n 2. You can also use Amazon Q Developer to quickly parse through the entire file to reveal more digestible information about your service’s behavior and overall system health. Ask:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nExplain what these metrics indicate about system performance.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nAmazon Q Developer should provide an analysis of such things as metric frequency patterns, identify potential performance issues or anomalies, and offer recommendations for optimization based on the observed system behavior.\\\\n\\\\nThe next step would be to configure an appropriate metrics reporter to emit these metrics to your monitoring system of choice. The specific implementation details will depend on your deployment environment and requirements, but the principles you’ve learned here will apply regardless of the reporter you choose.\\\\n## Get your changes reviewed one last time[¶][5]\\\\nTo wrap things up, you’ll submit one more code review to make sure everything is top-notch. Before you do, however, explore the custom prompt feature in Amazon Q Developer to create a prompt that helps review documentation quality. Too often, code reviews focus only on functionality while overlooking documentation gaps.\\\\n### Create and use a custom prompt[¶][6]\\\\n1. In your IDE, open the Amazon Q panel.\\\\n2. In the chat window, type @ and click Prompts in the menu that appears.\\\\n3. Click Create a new prompt and provide:\\\\n 1. A name for your prompt (e.g., `documentation`)\\\\n 2. In the blank `.md` file that opens, enter the following prompt text:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nAct as an Amazon senior technical writer and documentation expert. Perform a comprehensive\\\\nanalysis of the documentation and code comments based on Amazon's documentation standards.\\\\n\\\\nConstraints:\\\\n- Unclear or missing API documentation\\\\n- Inconsistent commenting style and coverage\\\\n- Missing or inadequate inline code comments\\\\n- Poor explanation of complex business logic\\\\n- Lack of usage examples and code samples\\\\n- Missing error handling documentation\\\\n- Inadequate README and setup instructions\\\\n- Inconsistent terminology and naming conventions\\\\n- Lack of troubleshooting and FAQ sections\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n4. Save the file.\\\\n5. Reference it in chat using `@_prompt-name_` (e.g., `@documentation`) or type `@` and select Prompts, followed by your prompt name.\\\\nAmazon Q Developer will then analyze your workspace using the custom prompt criteria and provide specific feedback on documentation quality, commenting standards, and areas for improvement. Feel free to act on any of the recommendations provided or simply review them.\\\\nPrompts are saved in the `~/.aws/amazonq/prompts` folder and can be used across multiple conversations and projects.\\\\nNote\\\\nFor a comprehensive collection of community-contributed prompts, check out the scripts in [this package][10].\\\\n### Submit a code review[¶][7]\\\\n1. Save and commit your changes for both the service and model packages.\\\\n2. Create a new code review (CR) by running this command within your workspace:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ncr --new-review --all\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n3. Follow the printed URL to access the CR.\\\\n4. Add reviewers and a meaningful review description.\\\\n5. Publish the review for others to examine.\\\\n6. Address any feedback or concerns raised by reviewers. If you don’t have a team member to review your change, you can use the [#sb-onboarding-code-review-requests][11] Slack channel.\\\\n7. Once you’ve implemented any feedback and your CR has been approved, click the Merge button in the CR dashboard.\\\\n## Conclusion[¶][8]\\\\nIn this workshop, you explored the core concepts of the Coral framework and learned how to build and enhance a Coral service. Specifically, you can now:\\\\n* Describe the model-first development approach used in Coral.\\\\n* Provision a new Coral service and interact with it using the Coral Explorer.\\\\n* Add and modify Coral service components.\\\\n* Leverage Amazon Q Developer to help develop Coral services by understanding project structure, adding operations, adding error handling, adding tests, adding and analyzing metrics, and more.\\\\nTo learn more about Coral services, also check out [BT112][12], which covers Coral Lambda Endpoint (CLE) development, as well as [BT120][13], where you’ll dive deeper into the inner workings of the Coral framework.\\\\n**This is the end of BT111: Coral for Java Web Services**. If you’re here because you’re taking the Software Builder Onboarding on Amazon Learn, [be sure to return there][14] to take the course survey and complete the course.\\\\nNext page:[Builder Tools 112: Coral for Java Lambda web services][12]Previous page:[BT111: Handle errors in a Coral service][15]\\\\n[1]: #bt111-use-coral-metrics\\\\n[2]: #learning-objectives\\\\n[3]: #access-the-framework-created-metrics\\\\n[4]: #explore-the-emitted-metrics\\\\n[5]: #get-your-changes-reviewed-one-last-time\\\\n[6]: #create-and-use-a-custom-prompt\\\\n[7]: #submit-a-code-review\\\\n[8]: #conclusion\\\\n[9]: ../_images/BT111-Explore-the-emitted-metrics.png\\\\n[10]: https://code.amazon.com/packages/AmazonBuilderGenAIPowerUsersQContext/trees/mainline/--/scripts\\\\n[11]: https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C03LU75HZC5\\\\n[12]: ../bt112/\\\\n[13]: ../bt120/\\\\n[14]: https://atoz.amazon.work/learn/trainings/TURLERN20250212223129602dbbd9?lms=LEARN\\\\n[15]: ../bt111-handle-errors-in-a-coral-service/\\\"}}\"}],\"totalResults\":3352,\"currentPage\":null}}"}]}

Why not just use whatever \\\\`bb format\\\\` does as a format-on-save hook?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRight off the bat, running \\\\`bb build\\\\` was not an option:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- overkill, formatting entire codebase instead of the active file\\\\\\\\n- 5+ seconds to execute = literally unusable\\\\\\\\n- formatting file directly instead of editor buffer could result in conflicts\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA naive approach was simply to find all the jars required to launch AJF's main.\\\\\\\\nOn a HappyTrails-3.7 project, this meant:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`sh\\\\\\\\n# Get all the jars in HT's build classpath \\\\(of which AJF and its deps are a subset\\\\)\\\\\\\\nCP=\\\\`brazil-path \\\\[HappierTrails\\\\]build.classpath\\\\`\\\\\\\\n# Run its main; edit in place using amazon style\\\\\\\\njava -cp $CP com.palantir.javaformat.java.Main --amazon --replace /path/to/file.java\\\\\\\\n\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPutting that on a bash script and running it as an on-save hook worked but it took ~1s, resulting in extremely poor ergonomics \\\\(high action-effect latency, well above ideal max of 200ms\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSome low-hanging fruit optimizations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Caching the classpath in some \\\\`/tmp/xxx\\\\` to avoid calls to \\\\`brazil-path\\\\` shed about 0.3s\\\\\\\\n- Adding all sorts of JVM flags in an attempt to speed startup shed at most 0.2s\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, the real problem was JVM startup time — run-once Java CLI tools are unsuitable for real-time use-cases.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately, there's �� GraalVM and native-image! ��\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith a bit patience and the help of good friend Claude, I was able to find the right combination of arguments to turn AmazonJavaFormat into a \\\\(hefty\\\\) binary that can achieve the same results as \\\\`brazil-build format\\\\` in real time \\\\(sub-100ms for 1000 LoC files\\\\), making it suitable to be used as a real-time formatter \\\\(e.g. formatting extension, \\\\[Run On Save\\\\]\\\\(https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emeraldwalk.RunOnSave\\\\) hook, file watcher, etc.\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Performance numbers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`\\\\\\\\n# Baseline; running AmazonJavaFormat as a java process\\\\\\\\n$ time ./script/amazon-java-format-util.sh run --amazon examples/Benchmark.java\\\\\\\\n> \\\\(...\\\\) 2.18s user 0.21s system 172% cpu 1.384 total\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# native-image version\\\\\\\\n$ time ./bin/amazon-java-format --amazon examples/Benchmark.java\\\\\\\\n> \\\\(...\\\\) 0.03s user 0.01s system 80% cpu 0.053 total\\\\\\\\n\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\"}\\n[1]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/Users/bcarv/AmazonJavaFormat-extension/\\\\\\\"\\n[2]: \\\\\\\"https://permissions.amazon.com/group.mhtml?group=bcarv-only&group_type=posix\\\\\\\"\\n[3]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/XWiki/sigv4-527623259044\\\\\\\"\\n[4]: \\\\\\\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/KnowledgeTech/WikiAsCode?utm_source=xwiki&utm_medium=content_header&utm_campaign=wikiascode_awareness\\\\\\\"\\n[5]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/Users/bcarv/AmazonJavaFormat-extension/?viewer=code&showlinenumbers=1\\\\\\\"\"},{\"url\":\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Users/alexsk/JavaAutoFormat/\",\"displayTitle\":\"JavaAutoFormat\",\"domain\":\"wiki\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1719508552000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":5,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n                    \\\\\\\\n      # Wiki source code of [JavaAutoFormat][1]\\n\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\n              **Primary Owner **[ elb-radar \\\\(POSIX\\\\) ][2]\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\n                                                                      \\\\\\\\n        Last modified 1 year ago by [alexsk][3].\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n---\\n\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  [Show line numbers][4]\\\\\\\\n  === Goal ===\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStandardize formatting of Java code across packages the Radar team owns.

All developers working on Aperture files should try to adhere to these guidelines. By keeping our code consistently formatted, we hope to write more maintainable code that is easier to support and update. If you have any questions about these standards, please contact aperture@amazon.com. We also try to clean up existing code that we own to match these standards, when possible.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n==General Standards==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n====Writing Code====\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\* '''4 spaces''' instead of tabs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Blank lines should be truly empty, containing no whitespace.\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Try to keep lines shorter than 120 characters wide. This is a guidelines, not a strict rule. If you have a good reason, occasional longer lines are OK. Our checkstyle will force lines to be less than 140 chars.\\\\\\\\n\\\\* A blank line at the end of the file is optional. Include it if it makes you happy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Multiple blank lines in a row should be collapsed into one blank line.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n====Functions====\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen writing functions use concise, human-readable names so other coders are able to easily determine what a function does.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn general, favor writing smaller, more atomic functions than writing massive functions. By splitting out functions, our code will be more modular, easier to test, and easier to maintain.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFollow Java naming conventions. Use camel case for function names \\\\(e.g. <code>getFileName</code>\\\\) and upper camel case \\\\(<code>ApplicationPackage</code>\\\\) for class names. If you have acronyms, keep them fully capped in function names \\\\(e.g. parseHTML\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n====Comments====\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll comments should be written in a server-side language, so they do not get emitted to the client. This applies to front end templated code \\\\(JSP/Mason\\\\). The one exception is standalone JS and CSS files, which will be run through a minimizer that should strip comments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn all Turing complete languages, use JavaDoc style comments, particularly when writing public functions or generally consumed APIs. If you want to include JavaDoc style comments on private functions too, that's even better.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor more on JavaDoc, check out:\\\\\\\\n\\\\* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc\\\\\\\\n\\\\* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse JavaDoc formatting in JavaScript too, that way we can implement a framework like JSDoc in the future to abstract documentation from our script files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n====When Doing Major Refactoring====\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you're doing major refactoring to a file that consists of a large amount of whitespace changes, consider doing all the whitespace changes first and then committing those changes without a CR \\\\(make sure you're not changing anything else, and make sure the code still passes all tests\\\\). This will relieve the code reviewer of the burden of reviewing large amount of whitespace changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you're working on a branch, refactor mainline, get it code reviewed, and then merge that into your branch. This will help make sure that mainline is refactored as quickly as possible so we don't double-refactor files. It also helps remove extra noise from code that's being merged into mainline, which leads to fewer reviewer errors.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n==Server Side==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n===Mason===\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Avoid <code>$\\\\_</code> and <code>@\\\\_</code>\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Use <code>:method</code>\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Always use <code>\\\\(\\\\)</code> on the end of function calls to make it explicit\\\\\\\\n<pre>\\\\\\\\n# GOOD\\\\\\\\nstring = something->getValue\\\\(\\\\)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#BAD\\\\\\\\nstring = something->getValue\\\\\\\\n</pre>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Use <code>%</code> for one-line perl, like if blocks, <code><%perl> ... </%perl></code> for multi-line blocks, and <code><% ... %></code> for inline output\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Use single indentation schemas for HTML and Perl, where possible. This means each layer of indenting affects both languages, like in the single line example below.\\\\\\\\n<pre>\\\\\\\\n<%# Inline %>\\\\\\\\n<h1><% $pageTitle %></h1>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<%# Single Line %>\\\\\\\\n% if \\\\($loggedIn\\\\) {\\\\\\\\n    Hello, <% $username %>\\\\\\\\n% }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<%# Block: Try to avoid in templates %>\\\\\\\\n<%perl>\\\\\\\\n    my $manageKindleStr = $m->comp\\\\('SELF:getString', strings => $strings, name => 'mas-ya-manage-kindle', default => 'Manage Your Kindle'\\\\);\\\\\\\\n    my $manageDeviceStr = $m->comp\\\\('SELF:getString', strings => $strings, name => 'mas-ya-manage-device', default => 'Manage Your Device'\\\\);\\\\\\\\n    my $editStr = $m->comp\\\\('SELF:getString', strings => $strings, name => 'mas-ya-devices-edit', default => 'Edit device name'\\\\);\\\\\\\\n</%perl>\\\\\\\\n</pre>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Finish each list element with a comma, since it makes it easier to append to the list and Perl discards the last comma\\\\\\\\n<pre>\\\\\\\\n$strings = $Strings->getString\\\\( {name => 'first-item'},\\\\\\\\n                                {name => 'second-item'},\\\\\\\\n                                {name => 'third-item'},\\\\\\\\n                                \\\\);\\\\\\\\n</pre>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n==== Eclipse Perl Plug-in ====\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instructions for installing the EPIC plug-in for for Eclipse see: \\\\[http://www.epic-ide.org/download.php www.epic-ide.org\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce you've installed EPIC \\\\(you'll need to restart Eclipse\\\\), go to: <code>Window > Preferences > Perl EPIC</code>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\* For Perl executable set it to: /apollo/env/envImprovement/bin/perl\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnder <code>Window > Preferences > Perl EPIC > Editor</code>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Display tab width is '''4'''\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Ensure checkbox for '''Use spaces instead of tabs''' is checked\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou will also want to modify the Eclipse file associations so that the below file types are associated with the EPIC editor.

Note that this plugin works with version 5 of checkstyles, whereas the checkstyles used with Happy Trailes is version 4. The version difference means that the checkstyle rules XML files are \\\\*not\\\\* compatible, so you need to create a custom version 5 file for eclipse. Fortunately, the differences between the two are very minor.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n=== Setting Up A Project With Checkstyles Eclipse Integration for the First Time<br/> ===\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#install the eclipse Checkstyles plugin, if not already installed\\\\\\\\n#create a v5 compatible checkstyles rules file in your project \\\\(find the DX standard \\\\[https://improvement-ninjas.amazon.com/s3files/s3get.cgi/awsdx-eclipse-checkstyle-rules.xml here\\\\]\\\\)\\\\\\\\n#create a suppression filter file \\\\(to tell it which files/directories to skip, such as unit test code\\\\) \\\\(find a default \\\\[https://improvement-ninjas.amazon.com/s3files/s3get.cgi/awsdx-eclipse-suppression-filter.xml here\\\\]\\\\)\\\\\\\\n#right click on the project, go to properties, go to Checkstyles, and select the Local Check Configurations tab\\\\\\\\n#create a new configuration, of type 'Project Relative Configuration', and browse to the eclipse checkstyle rules file you just created\\\\\\\\n#if you have properties set in your rules file, you will either need to provide defaults in the file or specify values under 'Additional properties...'\\\\\\\\n##at the minimum, set the checkstyle.suppression.filter property to ${config\\\\_loc}awsdx-eclipse-suppression-filter.xml\\\\\\\\n#if default property values are specified and the plugin warns about finding unresolved properties, you may simply click 'Continue anyway'\\\\\\\\n#back on the main Checkstyle options screen, click the 'Main' tab and select the local checkstyle configuration you just created as the one to use\\\\\\\\n#Update the eclipse checkstyle configuration and happier trails checkstyle configuration to match \\\\(a DX default happier trails \\\\(checkstyle v4\\\\) config file can be found \\\\[https://improvement-ninjas.amazon.com/s3files/s3get.cgi/awsdx-checkstyle-rules.xml here\\\\]\\\\)\\\\\\\\n#your project is now configured to use checkstyles!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce you check in the changed files \\\\(including .project and .checkstyle\\\\), it should just work for other team members who also have the checkstyle plugin installed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Checkstyles and GWT<br/> ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGWT has some limitations that prevent it from complying with some of the stricter checkstyles rules.

Why not just use whatever \\\\`bb format\\\\` does as a format-on-save hook?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRight off the bat, running \\\\`bb build\\\\` was not an option:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- overkill, formatting entire codebase instead of the active file\\\\\\\\n- 5+ seconds to execute = literally unusable\\\\\\\\n- formatting file directly instead of editor buffer could result in conflicts\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA naive approach was simply to find all the jars required to launch AJF's main.\\\\\\\\nOn a HappyTrails-3.7 project, this meant:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`sh\\\\\\\\n# Get all the jars in HT's build classpath \\\\(of which AJF and its deps are a subset\\\\)\\\\\\\\nCP=\\\\`brazil-path \\\\[HappierTrails\\\\]build.classpath\\\\`\\\\\\\\n# Run its main; edit in place using amazon style\\\\\\\\njava -cp $CP com.palantir.javaformat.java.Main --amazon --replace /path/to/file.java\\\\\\\\n\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPutting that on a bash script and running it as an on-save hook worked but it took ~1s, resulting in extremely poor ergonomics \\\\(high action-effect latency, well above ideal max of 200ms\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSome low-hanging fruit optimizations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Caching the classpath in some \\\\`/tmp/xxx\\\\` to avoid calls to \\\\`brazil-path\\\\` shed about 0.3s\\\\\\\\n- Adding all sorts of JVM flags in an attempt to speed startup shed at most 0.2s\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, the real problem was JVM startup time — run-once Java CLI tools are unsuitable for real-time use-cases.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately, there's �� GraalVM and native-image! ��\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith a bit patience and the help of good friend Claude, I was able to find the right combination of arguments to turn AmazonJavaFormat into a \\\\(hefty\\\\) binary that can achieve the same results as \\\\`brazil-build format\\\\` in real time \\\\(sub-100ms for 1000 LoC files\\\\), making it suitable to be used as a real-time formatter \\\\(e.g. formatting extension, \\\\[Run On Save\\\\]\\\\(https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emeraldwalk.RunOnSave\\\\) hook, file watcher, etc.\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Performance numbers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`\\\\\\\\n# Baseline; running AmazonJavaFormat as a java process\\\\\\\\n$ time ./script/amazon-java-format-util.sh run --amazon examples/Benchmark.java\\\\\\\\n> \\\\(...\\\\) 2.18s user 0.21s system 172% cpu 1.384 total\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# native-image version\\\\\\\\n$ time ./bin/amazon-java-format --amazon examples/Benchmark.java\\\\\\\\n> \\\\(...\\\\) 0.03s user 0.01s system 80% cpu 0.053 total\\\\\\\\n\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\"}\\n[1]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/Users/bcarv/AmazonJavaFormat-extension/\\\\\\\"\\n[2]: \\\\\\\"https://permissions.amazon.com/group.mhtml?group=bcarv-only&group_type=posix\\\\\\\"\\n[3]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/XWiki/sigv4-527623259044\\\\\\\"\\n[4]: \\\\\\\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/KnowledgeTech/WikiAsCode?utm_source=xwiki&utm_medium=content_header&utm_campaign=wikiascode_awareness\\\\\\\"\\n[5]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/Users/bcarv/AmazonJavaFormat-extension/?viewer=code&showlinenumbers=1\\\\\\\"\"},{\"url\":\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Users/alexsk/JavaAutoFormat/\",\"displayTitle\":\"JavaAutoFormat\",\"domain\":\"wiki\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1719508552000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":5,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n                    \\\\\\\\n      # Wiki source code of [JavaAutoFormat][1]\\n\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\n              **Primary Owner **[ elb-radar \\\\(POSIX\\\\) ][2]\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\n                                                                      \\\\\\\\n        Last modified 1 year ago by [alexsk][3].\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n---\\n\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  [Show line numbers][4]\\\\\\\\n  === Goal ===\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStandardize formatting of Java code across packages the Radar team owns.

All developers working on Aperture files should try to adhere to these guidelines. By keeping our code consistently formatted, we hope to write more maintainable code that is easier to support and update. If you have any questions about these standards, please contact aperture@amazon.com. We also try to clean up existing code that we own to match these standards, when possible.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n==General Standards==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n====Writing Code====\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\* '''4 spaces''' instead of tabs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Blank lines should be truly empty, containing no whitespace.\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Try to keep lines shorter than 120 characters wide. This is a guidelines, not a strict rule. If you have a good reason, occasional longer lines are OK. Our checkstyle will force lines to be less than 140 chars.\\\\\\\\n\\\\* A blank line at the end of the file is optional. Include it if it makes you happy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Multiple blank lines in a row should be collapsed into one blank line.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n====Functions====\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen writing functions use concise, human-readable names so other coders are able to easily determine what a function does.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn general, favor writing smaller, more atomic functions than writing massive functions. By splitting out functions, our code will be more modular, easier to test, and easier to maintain.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFollow Java naming conventions. Use camel case for function names \\\\(e.g. <code>getFileName</code>\\\\) and upper camel case \\\\(<code>ApplicationPackage</code>\\\\) for class names. If you have acronyms, keep them fully capped in function names \\\\(e.g. parseHTML\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n====Comments====\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll comments should be written in a server-side language, so they do not get emitted to the client. This applies to front end templated code \\\\(JSP/Mason\\\\). The one exception is standalone JS and CSS files, which will be run through a minimizer that should strip comments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn all Turing complete languages, use JavaDoc style comments, particularly when writing public functions or generally consumed APIs. If you want to include JavaDoc style comments on private functions too, that's even better.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor more on JavaDoc, check out:\\\\\\\\n\\\\* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc\\\\\\\\n\\\\* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse JavaDoc formatting in JavaScript too, that way we can implement a framework like JSDoc in the future to abstract documentation from our script files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n====When Doing Major Refactoring====\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you're doing major refactoring to a file that consists of a large amount of whitespace changes, consider doing all the whitespace changes first and then committing those changes without a CR \\\\(make sure you're not changing anything else, and make sure the code still passes all tests\\\\). This will relieve the code reviewer of the burden of reviewing large amount of whitespace changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you're working on a branch, refactor mainline, get it code reviewed, and then merge that into your branch. This will help make sure that mainline is refactored as quickly as possible so we don't double-refactor files. It also helps remove extra noise from code that's being merged into mainline, which leads to fewer reviewer errors.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n==Server Side==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n===Mason===\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Avoid <code>$\\\\_</code> and <code>@\\\\_</code>\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Use <code>:method</code>\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Always use <code>\\\\(\\\\)</code> on the end of function calls to make it explicit\\\\\\\\n<pre>\\\\\\\\n# GOOD\\\\\\\\nstring = something->getValue\\\\(\\\\)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#BAD\\\\\\\\nstring = something->getValue\\\\\\\\n</pre>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Use <code>%</code> for one-line perl, like if blocks, <code><%perl> ... </%perl></code> for multi-line blocks, and <code><% ... %></code> for inline output\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Use single indentation schemas for HTML and Perl, where possible. This means each layer of indenting affects both languages, like in the single line example below.\\\\\\\\n<pre>\\\\\\\\n<%# Inline %>\\\\\\\\n<h1><% $pageTitle %></h1>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<%# Single Line %>\\\\\\\\n% if \\\\($loggedIn\\\\) {\\\\\\\\n    Hello, <% $username %>\\\\\\\\n% }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<%# Block: Try to avoid in templates %>\\\\\\\\n<%perl>\\\\\\\\n    my $manageKindleStr = $m->comp\\\\('SELF:getString', strings => $strings, name => 'mas-ya-manage-kindle', default => 'Manage Your Kindle'\\\\);\\\\\\\\n    my $manageDeviceStr = $m->comp\\\\('SELF:getString', strings => $strings, name => 'mas-ya-manage-device', default => 'Manage Your Device'\\\\);\\\\\\\\n    my $editStr = $m->comp\\\\('SELF:getString', strings => $strings, name => 'mas-ya-devices-edit', default => 'Edit device name'\\\\);\\\\\\\\n</%perl>\\\\\\\\n</pre>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Finish each list element with a comma, since it makes it easier to append to the list and Perl discards the last comma\\\\\\\\n<pre>\\\\\\\\n$strings = $Strings->getString\\\\( {name => 'first-item'},\\\\\\\\n                                {name => 'second-item'},\\\\\\\\n                                {name => 'third-item'},\\\\\\\\n                                \\\\);\\\\\\\\n</pre>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n==== Eclipse Perl Plug-in ====\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instructions for installing the EPIC plug-in for for Eclipse see: \\\\[http://www.epic-ide.org/download.php www.epic-ide.org\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce you've installed EPIC \\\\(you'll need to restart Eclipse\\\\), go to: <code>Window > Preferences > Perl EPIC</code>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\* For Perl executable set it to: /apollo/env/envImprovement/bin/perl\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnder <code>Window > Preferences > Perl EPIC > Editor</code>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Display tab width is '''4'''\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Ensure checkbox for '''Use spaces instead of tabs''' is checked\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou will also want to modify the Eclipse file associations so that the below file types are associated with the EPIC editor.

Note that this plugin works with version 5 of checkstyles, whereas the checkstyles used with Happy Trailes is version 4. The version difference means that the checkstyle rules XML files are \\\\*not\\\\* compatible, so you need to create a custom version 5 file for eclipse.

Let me synthesize all this information to create a thorough analysis and plan for a universal code style system.\n\nFrom my analysis:\n\n1. **Current Workspace Structure**: I found 17+ Brazil workspaces with diverse projects including Apollo containers, Fargate services, CDK constructs, Rust services, and various tools.\n\n2. **Existing Code Style Configurations**:\n   - **Java**: Uses Checkstyle with 140-character line limit, no tabs, avoid star imports\n   - **TypeScript/CDK**: Uses ESLint + Prettier with 120-character line limit, 2-space indentation, single quotes, trailing commas\n   - **Rust**: Standard rustfmt (though I didn't see explicit configurations)\n\n3. **Amazon Official Standards from BuilderHub/Wiki**:\n   - **AmazonJavaFormat**: The official Amazon Java formatting standard with AMAZON style\n   - **PeruGradleJavaPresets**: Official plugin that includes AmazonJavaFormat + Spotless integration\n   - **Recommended standards from various teams**:\n     - Line length: 120 characters (consistent across most teams)\n     - Java: 4 spaces indentation, Amazon style via AmazonJavaFormat\n     - TypeScript: 2 spaces, ESLint + Prettier\n     - Coverage requirements: 70-90% depending on team\n\n4. **Key Amazon Tools**:\n   - **AmazonJavaFormat**: Official Java formatter with Amazon-specific style\n   - **Spotless**: Gradle plugin for automatic formatting\n   - **PeruGradleJavaPresets**: Peru-specific preset configurations\n   - **Checkstyle**: For linting and style enforcement\n   - **ESLint + Prettier**: For TypeScript/JavaScript\n\n5. **Amazon-Specific Considerations**:\n   - Brazil vs Peru dependency models affect tooling choices\n   \nI'll develop a unified approach that ensures consistent code quality across different programming environments. The strategy will focus on standardizing review processes, integrating security checks, and creating a flexible yet robust code style framework that adapts to various project needs.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":9,"cache_creation_input_tokens":35307,"cache_read_input_tokens":153512,"output_tokens":2}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"23526cb8-1cd1-45a5-9ca3-eb0160e0b3a2","timestamp":"2025-08-25T23:33:12.101Z"}

[Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with other supported tools][8]\\nThis page provides instructions on how to use the [PeruGradleJavaPresets][9] plugin with [AmazonJavaFormat][10] utilizing [Spotless][11].\\nImportant\\nPlease read [Using code quality tools with PeruGradleJavaPresets][12] before reading this page. It has general instructions and prerequisites on using the PeruGradleJavaPresets plugin.\\n## Configuration[¶][2]\\nPeruGradleJavaPresets provides the following default settings for Spotless:\\n\\n```\\nspotless {\\n   encoding(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)\\n\\n   java {\\n      // excludes generated source files inside the build, target, generated and generated-src directories\\n      targetExclude(\\\"**/build/**\\\", \\\"**/target/**\\\", \\\"**/generated/**\\\", \\\"**/generated-src/**\\\");\\n      // applies Amazon Java code style\\n      addStep(createAmazonJavaFormatStep(\\\"AMAZON\\\"))\\n\\n      // fixes annotations formatting for inline type annotations\\n      formatAnnotations()\\n      trimTrailingWhitespace()\\n      endWithNewline()\\n   }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n`isEnforceCheck` is set to `false` if the build is on the build fleet. Otherwise, it is set to `true`.\\nPeruGradleJavaPresets provides the following default settings for AmazonJavaFormat:\\n\\n```\\nformatter.code.style=AMAZON\\nformatter.apply.on.build=false\\nformatter.fail.on.diff=true\\n\\n```\\n`formatter.fail.on.diff` is set to `false` if the build is on the build fleet. Otherwise, it is set to `true`.\\nYou can specify your own Spotless and AmazonJavaFormat settings. Refer to [Overriding the default Spotless and AmazonJavaFormat settings][13] for more information.\\n## Usage[¶][3]\\n### Applying PeruGradleJavaPresets with Spotless[¶][4]\\nIn the `plugins` block of your `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`, add the Spotless Gradle plugin along with the PeruGradleJavaPresets plugin:\\nGroovybuild.gradle[¶][14]\\n```\\nplugins {\\n   // ...\\n   // other plugins\\n   // ...\\n\\n   id 'com.diffplug.spotless' version '6.+'\\n   id 'software.amazon.peru.java-presets' version '1.0.+'\\n}\\n\\n```\\nKotlinbuild.gradle.kts[¶][15]\\n```\\nplugins {\\n   // ...\\n   // other plugins\\n   // ...\\n\\n   id(\\\"com.diffplug.spotless\\\") version \\\"6.+\\\"\\n   id(\\\"software.amazon.peru.java-presets\\\") version \\\"1.0.+\\\"\\n}\\n\\n```\\n### Overriding the default Spotless and AmazonJavaFormat settings[¶][5]\\nIf you want to use your own Spotless or AmazonJavaFormat settings, you can override some or all of the settings provided by the PeruGradleJavaPresets plugin.\\n#### Overriding the default Spotless settings[¶][6]\\nOverriding default Spotless settings by using the `spotless` block in `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`. For example:\\nGroovybuild.gradle[¶][16]\\n```\\nspotless {\\n   setEnforceCheck(true)\\n\\n   java {\\n      target(\\\"**/src/**\\\", \\\"**/generated-src/**\\\")\\n      targetExclude(\\\"**/build/**\\\", \\\"**/target/**\\\")\\n   }\\n}\\n\\n```\\nKotlinbuild.gradle.kts[¶][17]\\n```\\nspotless {\\n   isEnforceCheck = true\\n\\n   java {\\n      target(\\\"**/src/**\\\", \\\"**/generated-src/**\\\")\\n      targetExclude(\\\"**/build/**\\\", \\\"**/target/**\\\")\\n   }\\n}\\n\\n```\\nSee the [Spotless Gradle plugin Quickstart instructions][18] for more information.\\nNote\\nIf you only need default Spotless settings provided by PeruGradleJavaPresets, you do not need to modify `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`.\\n#### Overriding the default AmazonJavaFormat settings[¶][7]\\nOverride default AmazonJavaFormat settings by specifying some Gradle properties in a `gradle.properties` file under the `/project_root`. The following properties are available:\\n|Property name|Type|Description|Default value|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|`formatter.code.style`|Enum|Set the code style to use. One of `AMAZON`, `PALANTIR`, `GOOGLE`, `AOSP`.|`AMAZON`|\\n|`formatter.apply.on.build`|Boolean|Set if AmazonJavaFormat formats your code automatically when the `assemble` task runs.|`false`|\\n|`formatter.fail.on.diff`|Boolean|Set if the build fails when the code is not formatted properly. If you set the value to either `false` or `true` in the `gradle.properties` file, then it will be applied to both local and build fleet builds.|`false` if the build is on the build fleet. `true` if the build is not on the build fleet (local build).|\\n\\nFor example:\\ngradle.properties[¶][19]\\n```\\n// ...\\n// other properties\\n// ...\\n\\nformatter.code.style=GOOGLE\\nformatter.apply.on.build=true\\nformatter.fail.on.diff=true\\n\\n```\\nNote\\nIf you only need default AmazonJavaFormat settings provided by PeruGradleJavaPresets, you do not need to modify `gradle.properties`.\\n## Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with other supported tools[¶][8]\\n* Instructions on using SpotBugs with PeruGradleJavaPresets configurations: [Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with SpotBugs][20]\\n* Instructions on using JaCoCo with PeruGradleJavaPresets configurations: [Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with JaCoCo][21]\\n* Instructions on using Checkstyle with PeruGradleJavaPresets configurations: [Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with Checkstyle][22]\\nNext page:[Vending code for Peru][23]Previous page:[Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with Checkstyle][22]\\n[1]: #using-perugradlejavapresets-with-amazonjavaformat\\n[2]: #configuration\\n[3]: #usage\\n[4]: #applying-perugradlejavapresets-with-spotless\\n[5]: #overriding-the-default-spotless-and-amazonjavaformat-settings\\n[6]: #overriding-the-default-spotless-settings\\n[7]: #overriding-the-default-amazonjavaformat-settings\\n[8]: #using-perugradlejavapresets-with-other-supported-tools\\n[9]: https://code.amazon.com/packages/PeruGradleJavaPresets\\n[10]: https://code.amazon.com/packages/AmazonJavaFormat\\n[11]: https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-gradle\\n[12]: ../howto-java-presets-gradle-plugin/\\n[13]: #overriding-default-spotless-and-amazonjavaformat-settings\\n[14]: #id3\\n[15]: #id4\\n[16]: #id5\\n[17]: #id6\\n[18]: https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/blob/main/plugin-gradle/README.md#quickstart\\n[19]: #id7\\n[20]: ../howto-java-presets-gradle-plugin-with-spotbugs/\\n[21]: ../howto-java-presets-gradle-plugin-with-jacoco/\\n[22]: ../howto-java-presets-gradle-plugin-with-checkstyle/\\n[23]: ../vending-code/\"}}}"}]}]},"uuid":"81deaa4a-eeec-4d47-89e2-70c3d1fdaf08","timestamp":"2025-08-25T23:33:12.927Z","toolUseResult":[{"type":"text","text":"{\"content\":{\"status\":\"success\",\"relativeHrefsDescription\":\"Relative hrefs represent related documents that can be accessed by evaluating the relative path with respect to the input URL.

It has general instructions and prerequisites on using the PeruGradleJavaPresets plugin.\\n## Configuration[¶][2]\\nPeruGradleJavaPresets provides the following default settings for Spotless:\\n\\n```\\nspotless {\\n   encoding(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)\\n\\n   java {\\n      // excludes generated source files inside the build, target, generated and generated-src directories\\n      targetExclude(\\\"**/build/**\\\", \\\"**/target/**\\\", \\\"**/generated/**\\\", \\\"**/generated-src/**\\\");\\n      // applies Amazon Java code style\\n      addStep(createAmazonJavaFormatStep(\\\"AMAZON\\\"))\\n\\n      // fixes annotations formatting for inline type annotations\\n      formatAnnotations()\\n      trimTrailingWhitespace()\\n      endWithNewline()\\n   }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n`isEnforceCheck` is set to `false` if the build is on the build fleet. Otherwise, it is set to `true`.\\nPeruGradleJavaPresets provides the following default settings for AmazonJavaFormat:\\n\\n```\\nformatter.code.style=AMAZON\\nformatter.apply.on.build=false\\nformatter.fail.on.diff=true\\n\\n```\\n`formatter.fail.on.diff` is set to `false` if the build is on the build fleet. Otherwise, it is set to `true`.\\nYou can specify your own Spotless and AmazonJavaFormat settings. Refer to [Overriding the default Spotless and AmazonJavaFormat settings][13] for more information.\\n## Usage[¶][3]\\n### Applying PeruGradleJavaPresets with Spotless[¶][4]\\nIn the `plugins` block of your `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`, add the Spotless Gradle plugin along with the PeruGradleJavaPresets plugin:\\nGroovybuild.gradle[¶][14]\\n```\\nplugins {\\n   // ...\\n   // other plugins\\n   // ...\\n\\n   id 'com.diffplug.spotless' version '6.+'\\n   id 'software.amazon.peru.java-presets' version '1.0.+'\\n}\\n\\n```\\nKotlinbuild.gradle.kts[¶][15]\\n```\\nplugins {\\n   // ...\\n   // other plugins\\n   // ...\\n\\n   id(\\\"com.diffplug.spotless\\\") version \\\"6.+\\\"\\n   id(\\\"software.amazon.peru.java-presets\\\") version \\\"1.0.+\\\"\\n}\\n\\n```\\n### Overriding the default Spotless and AmazonJavaFormat settings[¶][5]\\nIf you want to use your own Spotless or AmazonJavaFormat settings, you can override some or all of the settings provided by the PeruGradleJavaPresets plugin.\\n#### Overriding the default Spotless settings[¶][6]\\nOverriding default Spotless settings by using the `spotless` block in `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`. For example:\\nGroovybuild.gradle[¶][16]\\n```\\nspotless {\\n   setEnforceCheck(true)\\n\\n   java {\\n      target(\\\"**/src/**\\\", \\\"**/generated-src/**\\\")\\n      targetExclude(\\\"**/build/**\\\", \\\"**/target/**\\\")\\n   }\\n}\\n\\n```\\nKotlinbuild.gradle.kts[¶][17]\\n```\\nspotless {\\n   isEnforceCheck = true\\n\\n   java {\\n      target(\\\"**/src/**\\\", \\\"**/generated-src/**\\\")\\n      targetExclude(\\\"**/build/**\\\", \\\"**/target/**\\\")\\n   }\\n}\\n\\n```\\nSee the [Spotless Gradle plugin Quickstart instructions][18] for more information.\\nNote\\nIf you only need default Spotless settings provided by PeruGradleJavaPresets, you do not need to modify `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`.\\n#### Overriding the default AmazonJavaFormat settings[¶][7]\\nOverride default AmazonJavaFormat settings by specifying some Gradle properties in a `gradle.properties` file under the `/project_root`. The following properties are available:\\n|Property name|Type|Description|Default value|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|`formatter.code.style`|Enum|Set the code style to use. One of `AMAZON`, `PALANTIR`, `GOOGLE`, `AOSP`.|`AMAZON`|\\n|`formatter.apply.on.build`|Boolean|Set if AmazonJavaFormat formats your code automatically when the `assemble` task runs.|`false`|\\n|`formatter.fail.on.diff`|Boolean|Set if the build fails when the code is not formatted properly. If you set the value to either `false` or `true` in the `gradle.properties` file, then it will be applied to both local and build fleet builds.|`false` if the build is on the build fleet. `true` if the build is not on the build fleet (local build).|\\n\\nFor example:\\ngradle.properties[¶][19]\\n```\\n// ...\\n// other properties\\n// ...\\n\\nformatter.code.style=GOOGLE\\nformatter.apply.on.build=true\\nformatter.fail.on.diff=true\\n\\n```\\nNote\\nIf you only need default AmazonJavaFormat settings provided by PeruGradleJavaPresets, you do not need to modify `gradle.properties`.\\n## Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with other supported tools[¶][8]\\n* Instructions on using SpotBugs with PeruGradleJavaPresets configurations: [Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with SpotBugs][20]\\n* Instructions on using JaCoCo with PeruGradleJavaPresets configurations: [Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with JaCoCo][21]\\n* Instructions on using Checkstyle with PeruGradleJavaPresets configurations: [Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with Checkstyle][22]\\nNext page:[Vending code for Peru][23]Previous page:[Using PeruGradleJavaPresets with Checkstyle][22]\\n[1]: #using-perugradlejavapresets-with-amazonjavaformat\\n[2]: #configuration\\n[3]: #usage\\n[4]: #applying-perugradlejavapresets-with-spotless\\n[5]: #overriding-the-default-spotless-and-amazonjavaformat-settings\\n[6]: #overriding-the-default-spotless-settings\\n[7]: #overriding-the-default-amazonjavaformat-settings\\n[8]: #using-perugradlejavapresets-with-other-supported-tools\\n[9]: https://code.amazon.com/packages/PeruGradleJavaPresets\\n[10]: https://code.amazon.com/packages/AmazonJavaFormat\\n[11]: https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-gradle\\n[12]: ../howto-java-presets-gradle-plugin/\\n[13]: #overriding-default-spotless-and-amazonjavaformat-settings\\n[14]: #id3\\n[15]: #id4\\n[16]: #id5\\n[17]: #id6\\n[18]: https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/blob/main/plugin-gradle/README.md#quickstart\\n[19]: #id7\\n[20]: ../howto-java-presets-gradle-plugin-with-spotbugs/\\n[21]: ../howto-java-presets-gradle-plugin-with-jacoco/\\n[22]: ../howto-java-presets-gradle-plugin-with-checkstyle/\\n[23]: ../vending-code/\"}}}"}]}

The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze the conversation to understand the user's requests and my actions:\n\n1. **Initial Request**: The user asked me to \"Get context about all the workspaces in this directory\" after setting the model to Sonnet. This was a straightforward request to analyze Brazil workspaces in `/Volumes/workplace`.\n\n2. **My Initial Analysis**: I performed directory exploration using `LS` and `find` commands to identify Brazil workspaces. I found 17+ workspaces across various projects (ApolloContainers, FargateGoldenPath, BuilderHub, etc.) and provided a comprehensive summary.\n\n3. **User's Follow-up Request**: The user then asked me to \"ultrathink about the shared codestyle between all of these projects and consider what we would do in order to create a universal code style\". This was a significant shift from workspace analysis to code style standardization.\n\n4. **My Code Style Analysis**: I began analyzing existing code style configurations by:\n   - Finding checkstyle.xml, .eslintrc, prettier configs, etc.\n   - Reading specific configuration files to understand current patterns\n   - Identifying inconsistencies (Java: 140 char lines vs TypeScript: 120 chars, different indentation)\n   - Examining build.gradle files and package.json files for formatting tools\n\n5. **User Feedback**: The user provided critical feedback saying I should \"also ultrathink about if there are any internal examples on wiki or builderhub that could tell you what codestyle is best\". This was important user guidance to research Amazon's internal standards.\n\n6. **My Research Phase**: I then conducted extensive research using:\n   - `mcp__builder-mcp__InternalSearch` for BuilderHub documentation\n   - Found key resources like AmazonJavaFormat, PeruGradleJavaPresets, Spotless integration\n   - Searched Wiki for team standards and coding guidelines\n   - Discovered official Amazon Java formatting standards using AMAZON style\n\n7. **Key Findings**: Through research, I found:\n   - Amazon has official AmazonJavaFormat with AMAZON style (not Google or Palantir)\n   - PeruGradleJavaPresets plugin provides default configurations\n   - Teams use different approaches: Checkstyle vs Spotless vs AmazonJavaFormat\n   - Line length standards vary but 120 chars appears more common\n   - 4 spaces for Java indentation, 2 for TypeScript\n\nThe user is currently in plan mode, meaning I should not execute any changes but should present a comprehensive plan for creating the universal code style framework.\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user initially requested context about all Brazil workspaces in `/Volumes/workplace`, then expanded the scope to \"ultrathink about the shared codestyle between all of these projects and consider what we would do in order to create a universal code style.\" The user specifically emphasized researching \"internal examples on wiki or builderhub that could tell you what codestyle is best\" - indicating they wanted Amazon-specific standards, not generic ones.\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - Brazil workspaces and Peru dependency models\n   - AmazonJavaFormat with AMAZON style (official Amazon standard)\n   - PeruGradleJavaPresets plugin for standardized configurations\n   - Spotless gradle plugin for automatic formatting\n   - Checkstyle for linting and code quality\n   - ESLint + Prettier for TypeScript/JavaScript\n   - rustfmt for Rust formatting\n   - Build system integration (brazil-build format commands)\n   - HappierTrails 3.7+ with built-in AmazonJavaFormat support\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - `/Volumes/workplace/ApolloContainers/AwsSampleApp/src/ApolloContainersServicePeru/checkstyle.xml`\n     - Basic checkstyle config with 140 char line length, no tabs, avoid star imports\n     - ```xml\n       <module name=\"LineLength\">\n           <property name=\"max\" value=\"140\" />\n           <property name=\"ignorePattern\" value=\"^package.*|^import.*|a href|href|http://|https://|ftp://\" />\n       </module>\n       ```\n   - `/Volumes/workplace/ApolloContainers/AwsSampleApp/src/ApolloContainersServicePeruCDK/.eslintrc.cjs`\n     - TypeScript ESLint config extending prettier\n     - ```javascript\n       module.exports = {\n         root: true,\n         parser: '@typescript-eslint/parser',\n         plugins: ['@typescript-eslint'],\n         extends: ['plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended', 'prettier'],\n         rules: {},\n       };\n       ```\n   - `/Volumes/workplace/ApolloContainers/AwsSampleApp/src/ApolloContainersServicePeruCDK/.prettierrc`\n     - Prettier configuration with 120 char line length\n     - ```json\n       {\n         \"printWidth\": 120,\n         \"tabWidth\": 2,\n         \"singleQuote\": true,\n         \"trailingComma\": \"all\"\n       }\n       ```\n   - Multiple packageInfo files analyzed to identify 17+ Brazil workspaces across ApolloContainers, FargateGoldenPath, BuilderHub, Pipelines, etc.\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - No significant technical errors occurred\n   - User provided important guidance to research internal Amazon standards rather than generic ones\n   - This led to discovering AmazonJavaFormat as the official Amazon standard rather than Google or other external formatters\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Successfully identified inconsistencies across workspaces (140 vs 120 char lines, different indentation)\n   - Discovered Amazon's official formatting standards through BuilderHub and Wiki research\n   - Found that teams use different approaches but Amazon has standardized tooling available\n   - Identified that AMAZON style (not GOOGLE/PALANTIR) is the official standard\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"Get context about all the workspaces in this directory\"\n   - \"ultrathink about the shared codestyle between all of these projects and consider what we would do in order to create a universal code style\"\n   - \"You should also ultrathink about if there are any internal examples on wiki or builderhub that could tell you what codestyle is best\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Create and present a comprehensive plan for implementing universal code style across all workspaces\n   - Design framework that uses Amazon's official standards (AmazonJavaFormat with AMAZON style)\n   - Plan implementation strategy for rollout across 17+ workspaces\n\n8. Current Work:\n   I was in the middle of researching Amazon's internal code style standards through BuilderHub documentation and Wiki pages. I had just completed reading the official AmazonJavaFormat documentation and various team coding standards. The research revealed that Amazon has official formatting tools and standards that should be used rather than external ones. I am currently in plan mode, having completed the research phase and ready to present a comprehensive implementation plan.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Present a comprehensive plan for implementing universal code style framework using Amazon's official standards (AmazonJavaFormat with AMAZON style, PeruGradleJavaPresets, etc.) across all identified workspaces. The plan should include phased rollout strategy, specific tooling configurations, and integration with existing Brazil/Peru build systems..\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions.

Copy the PeruGradleJavaPresets configuration to your `build.gradle.kts`\n2. Run `brazil-build format` to format all Java files\n3. Configure your IDE to use AmazonJavaFormat\n\n### For Brazil Projects\n1. Add Spotless plugin configuration to your `build.gradle.kts`\n2. Run `./gradlew spotlessApply` to format files\n3. Configure build to run formatting on compile\n\n## IDE Configuration\n\n### IntelliJ IDEA\n1. Install AmazonJavaFormat plugin from internal plugin repository\n2. Enable \"Use Amazon Java Format\" in Settings > Code Style > Java\n3. Set line width to 120 characters\n\n### VSCode\n1. Install Java extension pack\n2.

Copy configuration files to your project root\n2. Install dependencies: `npm install`\n3. Run formatting: `npm run format`\n4. Configure your IDE for automatic formatting\n\n### For Existing Projects\n1. Backup existing configuration files\n2. Copy new configurations and merge any project-specific rules\n3. Update dependencies in package.json\n4. Run formatting to apply new style\n\n## Configuration Details\n\n### ESLint Configuration\n- Extends `@typescript-eslint/recommended` and `prettier`\n- Integrates with Prettier for formatting\n- Includes Amazon-specific custom rules\n- Supports both TypeScript and JavaScript files\n\n### Prettier Configuration\n- 120 character print width\n- 2-space indentation\n- Single quotes for strings\n- Trailing commas for all valid ES5+ syntax\n- Semicolons required\n\n### TypeScript Configuration\n- Target ES2020 for modern features\n- Strict mode enabled\n- Module resolution: Node\n- Include source maps for debugging\n\n## IDE Configuration\n\n### VSCode\n1. Install ESLint and Prettier extensions\n2. Configure settings.json:\n```json\n{\n  \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"esbenp.prettier-vscode\",\n  \"editor.formatOnSave\": true,\n  \"editor.codeActionsOnSave\": {\n    \"source.fixAll.eslint\": true\n  },\n  \"eslint.validate\": [\"typescript\", \"javascript\"]\n}\n```\n\n### IntelliJ IDEA / WebStorm\n1. Enable ESLint: Settings > Languages & Frameworks > JavaScript > Code Quality Tools > ESLint\n2. Enable Prettier: Settings > Languages & Frameworks > JavaScript > Prettier\n3. Configure format on save: Settings > Tools > Actions on Save\n\n## Build Integration\n\n### NPM Scripts\nAll templates include standard formatting scripts:\n- `npm run lint` - Check code style and quality\n- `npm run format` - Format all source files\n- `npm run format:check` - Check if files are formatted correctly\n- `npm run prebuild` - Run formatting before build\n\n### Brazil Build Integration\nFor projects using Brazil build system:\n- Add format tasks to build.gradle.kts\n- Integrate with `brazil-build format` command\n- Include formatting checks in CI/CD pipeline\n\n## Standards Details\n\n### File Organization\n- Group imports by type: Node modules, internal modules, relative imports\n- Separate import groups with blank lines\n- Sort imports alphabetically within each group\n\n### Naming Conventions\n- Variables/Functions: camelCase\n- Classes/Interfaces: PascalCase\n- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE\n- Files: kebab-case or camelCase (consistent within project)\n\n### Code Structure\n- Maximum function length: 50 lines\n- Maximum file length: 300 lines\n- Prefer composition over inheritance\n- Use TypeScript strict mode\n\n### Comments and Documentation\n- Use TSDoc format for function/class documentation\n- Inline comments for complex logic\n- TODO comments should include owner and date\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### Error Handling\n```typescript\n// Preferred: Explicit error handling\ntry {\n  const result = await riskyOperation();\n  return result;\n} catch (error) {\n  logger.error('Operation failed', { error });\n  throw new ServiceError('Failed to complete operation');\n}\n```\n\n### Type Definitions\n```typescript\n// Preferred: Explicit types for public APIs\ninterface UserService {\n  getUserById(id: string): Promise<User>;\n  createUser(userData: CreateUserRequest): Promise<User>;\n}\n```\n\n### Import Organization\n```typescript\n// 1. Node modules\nimport * as fs from 'fs';\nimport { Request, Response } from 'express';\n\n// 2. Internal modules\nimport { UserService } from '@amzn/user-service';\nimport { Logger } from '@amzn/logging';\n\n// 3. Relative imports\nimport { validateUser } from '../validation';\nimport { config } from './config';\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n1. **ESLint conflicts with Prettier**: Ensure `prettier` is in extends array after other configs\n2. **IDE not formatting**: Check that Prettier is set as default formatter\n3. **Build fails on formatting**: Run `npm run format` before build\n4. **Type errors after migration**: Update TypeScript version and fix breaking changes\n\n### Performance Tips\n- Use `.eslintignore` to exclude large generated files\n- Configure Prettier ignore patterns for performance\n- Enable ESLint caching in CI/CD: `eslint --cache`"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":11,"cache_creation_input_tokens":419,"cache_read_input_tokens":81682,"output_tokens":1341}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"eed5133c-d62c-43dd-a86f-ba048ca58528","timestamp":"2025-08-26T21:36:48.938Z"}

Configure format on save: Settings > Tools > Actions on Save\n\n## Build Integration\n\n### NPM Scripts\nAll templates include standard formatting scripts:\n- `npm run lint` - Check code style and quality\n- `npm run format` - Format all source files\n- `npm run format:check` - Check if files are formatted correctly\n- `npm run prebuild` - Run formatting before build\n\n### Brazil Build Integration\nFor projects using Brazil build system:\n- Add format tasks to build.gradle.kts\n- Integrate with `brazil-build format` command\n- Include formatting checks in CI/CD pipeline\n\n## Standards Details\n\n### File Organization\n- Group imports by type: Node modules, internal modules, relative imports\n- Separate import groups with blank lines\n- Sort imports alphabetically within each group\n\n### Naming Conventions\n- Variables/Functions: camelCase\n- Classes/Interfaces: PascalCase\n- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE\n- Files: kebab-case or camelCase (consistent within project)\n\n### Code Structure\n- Maximum function length: 50 lines\n- Maximum file length: 300 lines\n- Prefer composition over inheritance\n- Use TypeScript strict mode\n\n### Comments and Documentation\n- Use TSDoc format for function/class documentation\n- Inline comments for complex logic\n- TODO comments should include owner and date\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### Error Handling\n```typescript\n// Preferred: Explicit error handling\ntry {\n  const result = await riskyOperation();\n  return result;\n} catch (error) {\n  logger.error('Operation failed', { error });\n  throw new ServiceError('Failed to complete operation');\n}\n```\n\n### Type Definitions\n```typescript\n// Preferred: Explicit types for public APIs\ninterface UserService {\n  getUserById(id: string): Promise<User>;\n  createUser(userData: CreateUserRequest): Promise<User>;\n}\n```\n\n### Import Organization\n```typescript\n// 1. Node modules\nimport * as fs from 'fs';\nimport { Request, Response } from 'express';\n\n// 2. Internal modules\nimport { UserService } from '@amzn/user-service';\nimport { Logger } from '@amzn/logging';\n\n// 3. Relative imports\nimport { validateUser } from '../validation';\nimport { config } from './config';\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n1. **ESLint conflicts with Prettier**: Ensure `prettier` is in extends array after other configs\n2. **IDE not formatting**: Check that Prettier is set as default formatter\n3. **Build fails on formatting**: Run `npm run format` before build\n4. **Type errors after migration**: Update TypeScript version and fix breaking changes\n\n### Performance Tips\n- Use `.eslintignore` to exclude large generated files\n- Configure Prettier ignore patterns for performance\n- Enable ESLint caching in CI/CD: `eslint --cache`","structuredPatch":[]}}
