So let's just go ahead and get started. Um. Let's start off with just some quick introductions. Um, can you tell me all about yourself?\n    25→\n    26→[Speaker 4]\n    27→Uh, yeah. Hi, my name is in computer science at University of data. I'm currently working as a Java developer at Google as a contract basis, uh, where I'm working on Gemini application over last couple of months. I was selected to a small team, uh, focusing on focusing on testing and improving the Gemini, uh, artificial interest and machine learning. Responses and refining the prompts and helping improve the quality and availability of large language modules. Is elements. Since Ai and ml is evolving so quickly, it is a great opportunity to. I understand how these systems work behind. Uh, the scenes and contribute something that actually being improved actually. Along alongside that, I was working at the back end. Developer using Java, microservices, springboot, and some some print-in favors like react and angular. I, I also working at, uh, I was working, uh, before at Advance Knowledge Tech where I was building, uh, building a web platform and a customer portal, uh, using Java and. Services and also work at MIDFL ID Services where I handled the bug fixtures application. Maintenance and unit. Unit testing my core skills, uh, coming to my course, because, uh, I'm good at Java springboard rest API stalker. Docker and system designs, but I really enjoy. Enjoy working across the stack across the stack where optimizing apis. User-friendly applications interfaces. Are tightening up an application that's about me.\n    28→\n    29→[Speaker 1]\n    30→Cool, all right. Um, I'll tell you about myself. Uh, so my name is Ben. Uh. I'm a senior software developer with asbx, specifically on the golden path team. Uh, the golden path team is kind of responsible for defining the standards of how Services should be built across Amazon, with web services asynchronous job. Cues websites. We kind of figure out what is the best way to set up your infrastructure, the right tools you should use. Um, and then disseminate those best practices across the company through various means. Um. It's a very complicated. Place. I've been in Amazon for about eight years, and so I've been in a variety of different places. I started off over in Alexa. Um, I also worked on the AWS console page, and I also worked in retail for a little bit. Then, I migrated over to Prime air, where I worked on the Drone delivery. Systems and then over into operator tooling. Where I worked on. You know, general tools so you can manage your Ops at scale. Um. So, yeah, I've been here for a little while. A little bit of telling you how this interview is going to work. Um. We this isn't, uh, coding interview. This is just an interview where you and I are going to have a chat. Um, I'm going to ask a bunch of questions and kind of get to know you a little bit better. Um. This interview doesn't always take the full hour, just as a heads up. So, if we have any extra time at the end, um, I will make sure it'll give you time to, uh, ask me questions. And then, you can, you know, maybe use the restroom or whatever you need to do before your next interview.\n    31→\n    32→[Speaker 4]\n    33→Sure. Thank you\n    34→\n    35→[Speaker 1]\n    36→Cool, um? I'm going to be taking notes over on my other monitor, so if you see me not looking at you. Um, that is why I have two different monitors and the webcams over here. Same thing with typing. I've allowed keyboard. I'm very sorry. Um, yes. So? Jumping right into this. Um. Can you tell me about a time? Uh, when you were trying to understand a complex problem on your team and you had to dig into the details to figure it out.\n    37→\n    38→[Speaker 4]\n    39→Yeah, sure, uh, thinking? I'm thinking the situation.\n    40→\n    41→Yeah, I can think of one situation when I was working at Midfield I.T Services. We had a hospital, uh, facing software, where, uh, where it was used, uh, used by the hospital staff, and it began the experience, uh, experience. Experience the failure, the retrieving the patient record, the issue was very.\n    42→\n    43→So it was affecting the only the certain users only the few regions, and there was a no, no clear error pattern locks as well as a part of this, uh, I was, I thought a part of engineering scene. I was given task to identify the task, so the rules and ensure the minimal downtime. So, and I also make sure that system is system is reliable offices and after, and it is handling the critical handling the patient's data. Uh, the first I started unlike the locks, and I used the tracing tools,\n    44→\n    45→[Speaker 1]\n    46→Uh,\n    47→\n    48→[Speaker 4]\n    49→With the workflows, which are getting which are getting affected to flow, and I notice that I was a there was a failure, which was, which was linkedered, uh, to a specific pattern. We, which also involved in the reset joints in the database. So initially, I was not able to clearly get the locks actually, but when, when I Deep dive into the database query where it was triggering out, uh? That I basically have a two filter out the locks. That blocks. I like, how many database queries and taking a long time long time and then try to replicate issues? Uh, in the control environment of the staging. I try to discover the problem was from the Legacy data was. Database, which were, which I had a schema, like, add a circular references, and it has. Uh, proper indexing. We don't have a proper indexing and and, and for Legacy database, we are you you are using. We are using, like MySQL, uh, over there, uh, over the period there, the period of time it has a circular left references, and there was a proper indicing, and I, as I told. Uh, to resolve this issue, I have to coordinate with the database. And I had to redesign the complete schema as well and and introduce an optimized index as well. This was, was, this was an artist take forward scenario, uh, for me, because I was working as a backend engineer. Issue was on the database side. The two give the proper structure I have. I have to be a proper deep dive into the current database schema. So, I also see the pattern pattern. What is the workflow and and the author understanding once? Uh, I try to read to redesign the into the schema, according accordingly without having circular references. Uh, and. Simultaneously. I also simultaneously. I also upgraded backend logic. Uh, HK situations, uh scenarios and detailed log. So, that is, capture the few few future failures. And, uh, and at last, I documented, documented the interposing. Which I had shared shared in the conference page. Uh, so, so that, uh, so that I can help the future Engineers that you in our team, the Juniors, to trouble the similar issues. And finally, I was able to. Resolve the issue where I I was reducer query latency by 40 percent. And and also eliminate alternate the intermittent failure entirely. The system of this system update uptime is improved significantly, and the client also reported the increasing increased stress in our platform of projects, um, so, and\n    50→\n    51→[Speaker 1]\n    52→Before you keep going, I have a few questions.\n    53→\n    54→[Speaker 4]\n    55→Um. Okay,\n    56→\n    57→[Speaker 1]\n    58→So the and I just want to. I'm gonna kind of repeat some of this back to you to make sure I understand exactly the situation. Um,\n    59→\n    60→[Speaker 4]\n    61→You\n    62→\n    63→[Speaker 1]\n    64→Had an API that was failing, right? Uh, it was, it was throwing errors. Um, and your task was to go in and figure out why it was throwing errors. And the first thing you figured out was that your logs didn't actually have. Um, you weren't actually logging the things that you were supposed to be logging. Right? Does that sound correct? Yeah, okay,\n    65→\n    66→[Speaker 4]\n    67→So?\n    68→\n    69→[Speaker 1]\n    70→How did you know that it wasn't logging the things that needed to be logging if you didn't have the logs to know? What was going on?\n    71→\n    72→[Speaker 4]\n    73→So we had the only. We are having the basic log, like when the control is control is coming to the service. We are logging to the. We were also. We are also logging when we are. We are responding back. I basically have the time frame where, uh, when we enter the service and just before the response time. But uh. I didn't have a failures, messages, failure messages, as well as what is the exact data with query query time. Actually, so?\n    74→\n    75→[Speaker 1]\n    76→You, you're saying that you didn't have any details in the Vlogs, but you still had how long the request took? Right?\n    77→\n    78→[Speaker 4]\n    79→Yes, right, exactly. So, if you\n    80→\n    81→[Speaker 1]\n    82→Have how long the request took, what did you do to figure out, um? Like what? How did you? Where did you go from there?\n    83→\n    84→[Speaker 4]\n    85→Are you? It's so, so fast. I try to check whether APA has any problem. Uh, the eight I eight. They don't have any significant problem I apart from log logging. Logging was not that enough. I'll try to replicate the same issue with the staging environment, so when I try to when I try to stay sitting anywhere, I got to know. What the database, the culprit corporate the data was causing the issue. So, how did you\n    86→\n    87→[Speaker 1]\n    88→Figure out it was the database that was causing the issues? If you didn't have the logs, right? That's what I'm trying to figure out.\n    89→\n    90→[Speaker 4]\n    91→Yeah, I try to. I try to. Yeah, I try. I try to implement the logging it, and I was changing environment. And then, I, I figured out this, uh, figure it out. The setting as a moment, it was actually the query, uh, which was calling the issue, uh. I added the, uh, adding the locks, uh, when calling the query. The query there is one time was taking to get back to the data as well, uh, from the query action.\n    92→\n    93→[Speaker 1]\n    94→So, so it sounds like you, you didn't have the logs, but you knew the request was taking a long time. And so what he did is you went to your staging environment and you enabled debug logging so that you would have more logs to view the request. And after you had more logs, you were able to figure out that it was the database that was causing the issues. Is that correct?\n    95→\n    96→[Speaker 4]\n    97→Yes, right, yeah, okay.\n    98→\n    99→[Speaker 1]\n   100→So now that you knew it was the database that was throwing the issues, what was the area you were getting back from the database?\n   101→\n   102→[Speaker 4]\n   103→That, so the database was actually low. And, uh, what do you mean the database\n   104→\n   105→[Speaker 1]\n   106→Was low?\n   107→\n   108→[Speaker 4]\n   109→Not low. It's slow,\n   110→\n   111→[Speaker 1]\n   112→Slow, okay.\n   113→\n   114→[Speaker 4]\n   115→Yeah, yeah.\n   116→\n   117→[Speaker 1]\n   118→So, so you just noticed that the database was taking longer than it should have? How did you know how long it was supposed to be?\n   119→\n   120→[Speaker 4]\n   121→Uh, it is you are taking like 12 to 13 seconds worth taking. But, uh, when we are working on the real-time publication, uh? Ideal takes. I have so much time. I also checked check that data. I also check the data storing in our table thinking of the entries which which we had a table. So, in the production we had, we had took four tables, which, uh, which using this query and each of the table having close to thousand of thousands of Records. So, on average, I thought like, uh, this kind of data should know should not take more than more than a second or two seconds.\n   122→\n   123→[Speaker 1]\n   124→So, question so, like when you're doing database queries, it really depends on what you're doing some database queries. Take a long amount of time and some are supposed to take a short amount of time. So, what I'm trying to understand was, this is a new issue. Where it was starting to take a long time after a feature launch, or has it been a consistent issue, and then they finally decided to go fix it?\n   125→\n   126→[Speaker 4]\n   127→So, this issue was long reported by the user, but we, we did not make any changes, uh, because it was kept in the lower priority. Uh, and it was sent as sent to me when I, when I started clearing the backlog, uh, that is where I started, uh, finding got it so, but this was a long time pending here actually,\n   128→\n   129→[Speaker 1]\n   130→Right? So okay, so users of your application were complaining that it had. Bad response times, and your job was to go figure out how to make the response times better, not necessarily that this query was bad. You wanted to figure out how to make the the how to fix that user complaint.\n   131→\n   132→Diving back into the actual query itself. You said that there were cyclical dependencies that were built in over time. Um, can you explain what you mean by that?\n   133→\n   134→[Speaker 4]\n   135→Yeah, I mean, we had. Lives are for user stories, which which we are implemented in the future. Uh, religious. And also, we had a few of the user stories, which have to, which have to implement in the near near near past. This actually had actually more complexity to query as well. And before, uh, before when it was actually. Raise. This issue was the issuer raised. Actually delay of 8 seconds, but when it started checking, it was actually moved to 60 seconds actually. Uh, this is this is where I got to know. The recent development has also caused in the query actually.\n   136→\n   137→[Speaker 1]\n   138→Okay, I think I understand. Um, but so what was the? What was the actual like, what was the item that was causing a cyclical dependency? Like, what was, what was the actual root cause of that issue?\n   139→\n   140→[Speaker 4]\n   141→So,\n   142→\n   143→[Speaker 1]\n   144→Yeah,\n   145→\n   146→[Speaker 4]\n   147→I mean, one of the recent user story. Um. The implementation was done in the such a way that we had to. We had to circular dependencies, uh, one table, one table from the another table. So, this was actually. Actually, a chain we are calling, and there was no. Uh, till the tree is completed from, uh, we, we was changing the calls. This is where. This is where we are causing a lot of issues. But when I was reading a redesigning my database, I got. I got another. Don't need to complete the tree. We just need to file the developer 3. Of a file level of the. File levels up to five levels. We reorganized and reorganized the data schema so. We can have a less complexity in our query actually.\n   148→\n   149→[Speaker 1]\n   150→Okay, I think I understand, um. All right, let's move on to the next question. Um. So, can you tell me about a time where you needed a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job well?\n   151→\n   152→[Speaker 4]\n   153→The situation.\n   154→\n   155→I wanted to build their restful service over here. You using electric search and I was working for a client who needed who needed an agent basis. Was a complex search. We search which you have also are a capabilities data set. And so I had to work with the basic search implementation before, uh, but the project has demanding for advanced query optimization and and customer analyzers, and I also integration with the kibana and real-time metrics, uh, so these things I was not ever before. So, I, I, I have to love history, learn the festival, learn the.\n   156→\n   157→Oils as well. My goal here is here! I is two designer to design and Implement the scalable search solution where? Where I can handle the queries, named queries, and multi-language data and also Dynamic filters. And. And also wanted to maintain the low latency. So, so to have this, uh, I need to have a deeper knowledge so that I can choose write the right Technologies and write coding strategies,\n   158→\n   159→[Speaker 1]\n   160→And I\n   161→\n   162→[Speaker 4]\n   163→Can have a low latency. Accuracy. And I realized that dialysis search was not only the only the requirement. I was. I. I also also learned more deeper. Uh, deeper, into the loose and's interverse, where we take the tokenized intervals. Uh, token strategy. And it tells, uh, it is. I mean, how to how to invert the indexes and how to check the custom analyzers using stemming and synchronization synonyming filter synonyming filtering. So, so I can improve the relevant scoring, and uh, I'll also learn base marking and different, uh, query types.\n   164→\n   165→And, uh, and I also tuned them into better performance, uh, performance. And I also learned something about the kibana dashboard as well, so that, uh so, visualization real quick,\n   166→\n   167→[Speaker 1]\n   168→Um. Let's I want to kind of like dive into some of these things. So let's, let's try to like, keep it a little more, uh, like focused on one thing, right? So, I think you said elasticsearch was one of the things you had to learn about, right?\n   169→\n   170→[Speaker 4]\n   171→Yeah, so.\n   172→\n   173→[Speaker 1]\n   174→What? Why did you need to learn more about elasticsearch specifically?\n   175→\n   176→[Speaker 4]\n   177→Yeah, um, yeah, because I had to work on a previous project where I I was using the basic search implementation. Uh, but Alex research, but Alexis search was not used at all in past. This and this API, which was creating which I, which we have to use analysis search, uh, over here.\n   178→\n   179→[Speaker 1]\n   180→Okay, so you you had to use elasticsearch for one of the apis that your your first search function that your old team or your an old project needed to use. So, how did you go about learning how to use elasticsearch more effectively?\n   181→\n   182→[Speaker 4]\n   183→Yeah, so for the same. Uh, I, I had to learn about the. Uh, in Lucian intervals. And, uh, so, where I can use the tokenization strategies, right? How I can. But how\n   184→\n   185→[Speaker 1]\n   186→Did you learn about it? Like, what did you do in order to learn more about elasticsearch? I understand what you had to learn, but I understand how you earned it.\n   187→\n   188→[Speaker 4]\n   189→Yeah, yes, by style. Step down. What are the, what are things are needed in the electric search, and uh? What would be the help will be for the helpful to implement in this project? And, uh, then I went and had, and I went to the my manager and with this list and asked?\n   190→\n   191→Workshop. I run this app and and he knows we do. We didn't. Also, as you know, we didn't have any workshops. So, my manager approved for the external Workshop as well, uh, where, whereas I went, I went to the external Workshop. Saw some of the audition documentations. Official documentations on the Galaxy search. That is how I started learning learning on the electric research,\n   192→\n   193→[Speaker 1]\n   194→All right, so you? So, basically, the first thing you did was you went to your manager and said, I want to learn how to use elasticsearch. Um, and I assume you told him why?\n   195→\n   196→[Speaker 4]\n   197→Yes, I, I told him, why? Because I wanted to create this restful apis, which has advanced, not advanced search mechanism. So,\n   198→\n   199→[Speaker 1]\n   200→We\n   201→\n   202→[Speaker 2]\n   203→Had a\n   204→\n   205→[Speaker 4]\n   206→Large number of data sets. Where I had you told him that elastic could be better? And, and I'm not aware of it. Okay, so\n   207→\n   208→[Speaker 1]\n   209→Then? You. There was no internal Workshop at the company that you were working on for how to use elasticsearch, so you went, and you got to prove to attend an external Workshop. So, what was this external Workshop?\n   210→\n   211→It's, yeah. So, this external version\n   212→\n   213→[Speaker 4]\n   214→Work basically online Workshop. Uh, so I used online tools to learn about the electric search and what are the methods methodology we can use? So this, I can. I try to learn from the external platform.\n   215→\n   216→[Speaker 1]\n   217→Okay.\n   218→\n   219→[Speaker 4]\n   220→And\n   221→\n   222→[Speaker 1]\n   223→So, in the in the workshop, how do they have you go about learning how to use elasticsearch? Like, what was the, what was the difference? How did the training work?\n   224→\n   225→[Speaker 4]\n   226→Yeah, that basically that the first they are explain. But they playing the concepts of the courses of the concepts and what is the electric steps and what? What? What do you need to analyze that in a real-time scenario, and uh, and what to start on the road or role-based learning path, and they told that what this, what is the elastic search engineering have, and what are the concepts, indexing queries, and uh, cluster design and performing?\n   227→\n   228→When collecting on the large Matrix and? And APM data. Using how to integrate the kibana lock? Log stat and. And they started with the Hands-On lab and the products where they helped me to build a search applications from scratch. Uh, they also. Showing how we can automate in the query using domain specifically specific language and and how we can configize and monitor the performance using kibana, and how, how it how it works in a real world in a data set? Can simulate the, simulate the production scenarios, and they also help me in the certificate education possible possible in the future as well.\n   229→\n   230→[Speaker 1]\n   231→All right. So, so you learned about elasticsearch at the workshop? It sounds. Sounds good. It sounds like the workshop was probably a great way to actually learn about it since they made you do a bunch of different stuff. Um, so once you learned about elasticsearch. How did that? How did that go in the workshop? Like, what did you were you able to create? The the API that you wanted to create for search?\n   232→\n   233→[Speaker 4]\n   234→Yes, uh, in the workshop, I was not able to create, but after the after the workshop, I will able to create the LS6 search. And, and also the solution which I created reducer query. This response, almost by 60 percent, and it also supported the multi-lang, multi-lang language search, uh, and I also able to achieve a creation of kibana. Me to also understand the elasticsearch in the deeper way. So, this was my, and this was my major experience where I have to learn with some learn something to. Everyone implementation.\n   235→\n   236→[Speaker 1]\n   237→All right. Well, thank you for that story. Um, let's move on, and I'm going to ask you another one. Um. Can you describe a time? When you needed the influence appear. Who had a differing opinion about a shared goal.\n   238→\n   239→[Speaker 4]\n   240→In your one, can you repeat the question one second, sure,\n   241→\n   242→[Speaker 1]\n   243→Um? I need you to describe a time. Uh, where you needed to influence a peer. Uh, who had a differing opinion about a shared goal?\n   244→\n   245→[Speaker 4]\n   246→Okay. And yes, I can think of one scenario. Uh, when I was working at ips Corporation, uh, so I was actually tasked with the optimum Legacy model, uh, model. Actually, it was, uh, it was handing the user based user based role access across the multiple services, uh, basically, we had multiple services and.\n   247→\n   248→Apis as well. We, we, we want to make sure different users with the different roles, uh, will have us have the access. Only for the few Services. No, not all of them, so we want to cook. Want to control based on the roads based on the roles they have? And so over here. We had to basically basically improve the performance, so the the system was already existing. And we also, and we want to also maintain the maintain without disturbing the existing functionalities, and from improving the performance. Comments when we are discussing one of the peer.\n   249→\n   250→Using the condition logic. Where we can have where we can control a layer directly and? With the. With this role-based handling, I was a I was not very, uh, I was not okay with it, but I, uh, because I was believing that this could be increased, uh, the the technical depth, because because we are adding a lot of technical logic in our controller, uh, layer in in it can make the future. I can make a few future also very critical, so we had. Multiple roles in place actually in the future. So I needed to actually. Uh, so I needed to actually influence my peer over here so we can. So we can adapt to the modular, scalable approach. Because we can, you can. We can use a strategy pattern, and we can also keep shared goals so that, uh, we can deliver the timely and and system test stability. Is also intact. When I propose this idea, I was. Was not very okay because he was thinking. The strategy pattern might be delayed. And. Instead of telling him. The strategy pattern is a better way. What I try what I try here is. Uh, I, I insulate the design, design, meeting, and, and we can have the paid program. I I try to walk through the real-time scenarios where I proposed a proposed a current current current patch, which which could break, which could break the under some edge cases. Some of the Educators. Uh, when we had nested roles or so,\n   251→\n   252→[Speaker 1]\n   253→Hold on real quick. Hold on real quick, um? I kind of want to before you go talk too much about the actual technical implementation of it. I, I just want to talk about, like, kind of, you know, dive into a few more bits of this before you, you know, tell me more. Um. So you, you said that you, you're trying to implement, um? Different roles for your account. Is that right?\n   254→\n   255→[Speaker 3]\n   256→Yeah, and so\n   257→\n   258→[Speaker 1]\n   259→Those those roles. I, I'm assuming you guys are using AWS? Or you're using Azure or something.\n   260→\n   261→[Speaker 4]\n   262→No, no, no, we are not using AWS instant. We are handling, uh, our application. It was our springboard application and, uh, inside the springboot application, we are we we were using the annotations, uh, for the role-based access and particular Services. So, so?\n   263→\n   264→[Speaker 1]\n   265→Okay, so you're using spring boot for for your services, but when you say roll based access, what are the roles that teams are? Using. Right, so\n   266→\n   267→[Speaker 4]\n   268→We have multiple roles like admin inside admin itself.\n   269→\n   270→[Speaker 1]\n   271→Okay, so these are roles similar to like. I am a software engineer like someone might be a manager. Someone might be a director, etc, etc. Is that correct? Yeah,\n   272→\n   273→[Speaker 4]\n   274→Okay, exactly? And\n   275→\n   276→[Speaker 1]\n   277→So. In, just like a couple sentences, what was the, what was the thing you were trying to improve about the way you used roles?\n   278→\n   279→[Speaker 4]\n   280→So, we have already have the roles which, which was a legacy system. Uh, so now, we we are moving out out of the Legacy system, move out from the Legacy system because it was slow.\n   281→\n   282→[Speaker 1]\n   283→Okay,\n   284→\n   285→[Speaker 4]\n   286→And when we are implementing when we are implementing the new strategies we are conflicting, uh? On the strategies between me, me, and my peer. So, so\n   287→\n   288→[Speaker 1]\n   289→Hold on real quick when you say that you have conflicting strategies when moving off of the Legacy system. What were? Uh, what was this specific item that was, um? You know in contention?\n   290→\n   291→[Speaker 4]\n   292→Um. So, basically, we should not. Uh, we should. We should increase. I, I'll be changing at this time and decrease the latency that was a major problem, uh, existing model. Okay,\n   293→\n   294→[Speaker 1]\n   295→So the\n   296→\n   297→[Speaker 4]\n   298→So, you're trying to move\n   299→\n   300→[Speaker 1]\n   301→On to the new system in order to decrease latency, right? Like, that's is decreased latency, and was there another item?\n   302→\n   303→We also have majorly\n   304→\n   305→[Speaker 4]\n   306→Have we had latency as a problem, all right. So that\n   307→\n   308→[Speaker 1]\n   309→Was, that was the big one is you wanted to move off of the old system for latency reasons, all right. So,\n   310→\n   311→[Speaker 4]\n   312→Yes, no.\n   313→\n   314→[Speaker 1]\n   315→So, what did you want to do in order to? Decrease the latency when you move to the new system.\n   316→\n   317→[Speaker 4]\n   318→Yeah, when, when we are where disc discussing the possible approaches, uh, move to the new system. My peer was, as it was on, to improve the. To improve this, she he was suggesting a quick path using a using a condition logic and direct\n   319→\n   320→[Speaker 1]\n   321→Control control layer. Branching logic in the control area in order to help improve latency by reducing the amount of code that needed to be traversed. Perhaps? Yes, and what was he and what was your yeah? What was your recommendation for how to fix it?\n   322→\n   323→[Speaker 4]\n   324→My recommendation would be like, not not to not to write the logic in the control country in the control controller layer instead. Uh, my goal was to have a study strategy pattern. So, so that I already noticed they are hierarchical? Application. Our application, so strategy application would have much more a better iPhone actually. If we directly add if we directly add in it this in the control layer, the maintaining would be very hard and difficult. Because we had a hierarchy structure.\n   325→\n   326→[Speaker 1]\n   327→So\n   328→\n   329→[Speaker 4]\n   330→When we revoke\n   331→\n   332→[Speaker 1]\n   333→So the, it sounds like the. Um. You thought your method was better because it'll be more maintainable in the future, right?\n   334→\n   335→[Speaker 4]\n   336→Yes, okay. So how\n   337→\n   338→[Speaker 1]\n   339→Did you like what? What specific actions did you take, um? To help convince. You know, your peer, like, how did you guys get to a consensus at the end? Like,\n   340→\n   341→[Speaker 4]\n   342→Yeah, first, I tried to walk through the real real scenario real world scenario, where? We can have a breaking news in the breaking the strategy. I try to show how to how hierarchical our roles roles are. So that he can understand where we when we are revoking, uh, revoking a room how much storage change we need to make if we have, if we had to go with the logic change, we again we should test the entire module. I, I, and I also believe the lightweight prototype lightweight prototype using using strategic pattern. So, so I can show him that I, I can show how? How can we use the predict predicate the basic filter filter filtering and how and show him how it could be looked? Clean the separation of corners and ex and extending in the future so?\n   343→\n   344→[Speaker 1]\n   345→You basically showed him why your approach was better. Is that right? So\n   346→\n   347→[Speaker 4]\n   348→Did\n   349→\n   350→[Speaker 1]\n   351→He? Did he agree after you showed him? Uh, that your approach was in fact better.\n   352→\n   353→[Speaker 4]\n   354→I actually, he asked me a lot of questions during the. This flow, and he and he also want to try to prove adding the country, adding the control logic is better, uh, but we took once, uh, once at one step at a time, uh. So, then we try to list what could be, what could be the better approach? So we created a conflict confluence document. Depending what a court case and. And which case, and what would be the better approach? So end of this I at the end of this? Um, we were able to get almost 80 percent 80 of cases. Our strategy of using using the strategy strategy over like? During the strategy pattern was a better pattern and the better way. And so\n   355→\n   356→[Speaker 1]\n   357→What was the actual tangible results that your customers felt based off of this change?\n   358→\n   359→[Speaker 4]\n   360→So, then, when we was implementing the strategy pattern, so the refactor module actually reduce the code complexity by 40%, uh? And we also improve the test coverage as well because we added just. We added it in the strategy pattern, right? Uh, we had to add no cases to the strategy pattern, and whenever we had a new role, we we need a. We need to add very less stress cases and. Able to add a pass security as well. How did\n   361→\n   362→[Speaker 1]\n   363→You manage to quantify the code complexity reduction?\n   364→\n   365→[Speaker 4]\n   366→Yeah, we use we. We use the sonar queue for this, the complex, uh, the the complexity we, uh, which was there before the recent implementation, uh, we tried to compare, uh, we tried to compare the sonar Cube reports.\n   367→\n   368→[Speaker 1]\n   369→Okay.\n   370→\n   371→[Speaker 5]\n   372→Cool. That's interesting.\n   373→\n   374→[Speaker 4]\n   375→Uh, and and user also reported, uh, we had a latency issue, right, and? And we also improved by. We also improved by 70 percent.\n   376→\n   377→[Speaker 1]\n   378→You had a 70 latency Improvement just from implementing a different question.\n   379→\n   380→[Speaker 4]\n   381→A\n   382→\n   383→[Speaker 1]\n   384→Candler. How much of that was attributed to using the strategies rather than just moving off of the Legacy system?\n   385→\n   386→[Speaker 4]\n   387→Uh, we didn't actually implement the complete complete model using the controller layer. Strategy, but but a high level. It was just improving 30 to 40 percent.\n   388→\n   389→[Speaker 1]\n   390→So, about 30 to 40 of the latency decreases because of this change.\n   391→\n   392→[Speaker 3]\n   393→Yes, fine. Cool,\n   394→\n   395→[Speaker 1]\n   396→All right? Well, that is all the questions I have. Um, do you have any questions for me?\n   397→\n   398→[Speaker 4]\n   399→Yeah, I do have one question.\n   400→\n   401→Uh, like, what would be, uh, like, what would be like first three to six months for HD? One role look for new joiners?\n   402→\n   403→[Speaker 1]\n   404→Typically the way that Amazon operates with new hires is we try to get them to hit the ground running. So, the first three to six months will probably be a lot of trainings to try to get you to understand. Uh, kind of how we do things internally build systems. We use package management, etc, etc. And then, basically, we tried to get you to hit the ground running, um. Amazon definitely values delivery in their sde ones, but also, we have a really high bar for the work that is actually being delivered. So, the first three to six months will probably be a lot of you have a lot of coding tasks to complete yet. You're getting a lot of feedback on. You know, raising the bar at how, how do you code things at a Amazon appropriate level? Um, to make sure that we can sustain it for the long term. So?\n   405→\n   406→[Speaker 3]\n   407→Yeah,\n   408→\n   409→[Speaker 4]\n   410→Well, okay, yeah. Cool! Yeah, well, if you have any other questions then, uh, good luck in your next interview. Yeah, thank you so much! Have a good day, bye!\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious.

Yeah.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAll right.\n\nNext.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, how are you doing today?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nI'm doing good. What about you?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI'm also doing very well, um. You know, it's a Thursday week's almost over. So always feels good.\n\nAll right, um, all right. So let's just go ahead and get started. Um. Let's start off with just some quick introductions. Um, can you tell me all about yourself?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nUh, yeah. Hi, my name is in computer science at University of data. I'm currently working as a Java developer at Google as a contract basis, uh, where I'm working on Gemini application over last couple of months. I was selected to a small team, uh, focusing on focusing on testing and improving the Gemini, uh, artificial interest and machine learning. Responses and refining the prompts and helping improve the quality and availability of large language modules. Is elements. Since Ai and ml is evolving so quickly, it is a great opportunity to. I understand how these systems work behind. Uh, the scenes and contribute something that actually being improved actually. Along alongside that, I was working at the back end. Developer using Java, microservices, springboot, and some some print-in favors like react and angular. I, I also working at, uh, I was working, uh, before at Advance Knowledge Tech where I was building, uh, building a web platform and a customer portal, uh, using Java and. Services and also work at MIDFL ID Services where I handled the bug fixtures application. Maintenance and unit. Unit testing my core skills, uh, coming to my course, because, uh, I'm good at Java springboard rest API stalker. Docker and system designs, but I really enjoy. Enjoy working across the stack across the stack where optimizing apis. User-friendly applications interfaces. Are tightening up an application that's about me.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nCool, all right. Um, I'll tell you about myself. Uh, so my name is Ben. Uh. I'm a senior software developer with asbx, specifically on the golden path team. Uh, the golden path team is kind of responsible for defining the standards of how Services should be built across Amazon, with web services asynchronous job. Cues websites. We kind of figure out what is the best way to set up your infrastructure, the right tools you should use. Um, and then disseminate those best practices across the company through various means. Um. It's a very complicated. Place. I've been in Amazon for about eight years, and so I've been in a variety of different places. I started off over in Alexa. Um, I also worked on the AWS console page, and I also worked in retail for a little bit. Then, I migrated over to Prime air, where I worked on the Drone delivery. Systems and then over into operator tooling. Where I worked on. You know, general tools so you can manage your Ops at scale. Um. So, yeah, I've been here for a little while. A little bit of telling you how this interview is going to work. Um. We this isn't, uh, coding interview. This is just an interview where you and I are going to have a chat. Um, I'm going to ask a bunch of questions and kind of get to know you a little bit better. Um. This interview doesn't always take the full hour, just as a heads up. So, if we have any extra time at the end, um, I will make sure it'll give you time to, uh, ask me questions. And then, you can, you know, maybe use the restroom or whatever you need to do before your next interview.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nSure. Thank you\n\n[Speaker 1]\nCool, um? I'm going to be taking notes over on my other monitor, so if you see me not looking at you. Um, that is why I have two different monitors and the webcams over here. Same thing with typing. I've allowed keyboard. I'm very sorry. Um, yes. So? Jumping right into this. Um. Can you tell me about a time? Uh, when you were trying to understand a complex problem on your team and you had to dig into the details to figure it out.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, sure, uh, thinking? I'm thinking the situation.\n\nYeah, I can think of one situation when I was working at Midfield I.T Services. We had a hospital, uh, facing software, where, uh, where it was used, uh, used by the hospital staff, and it began the experience, uh, experience. Experience the failure, the retrieving the patient record, the issue was very.\n\nSo it was affecting the only the certain users only the few regions, and there was a no, no clear error pattern locks as well as a part of this, uh, I was, I thought a part of engineering scene. I was given task to identify the task, so the rules and ensure the minimal downtime. So, and I also make sure that system is system is reliable offices and after, and it is handling the critical handling the patient's data. Uh, the first I started unlike the locks, and I used the tracing tools,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 4]\nWith the workflows, which are getting which are getting affected to flow, and I notice that I was a there was a failure, which was, which was linkedered, uh, to a specific pattern. We, which also involved in the reset joints in the database. So initially, I was not able to clearly get the locks actually, but when, when I Deep dive into the database query where it was triggering out, uh? That I basically have a two filter out the locks. That blocks. I like, how many database queries and taking a long time long time and then try to replicate issues? Uh, in the control environment of the staging. I try to discover the problem was from the Legacy data was. Database, which were, which I had a schema, like, add a circular references, and it has. Uh, proper indexing. We don't have a proper indexing and and, and for Legacy database, we are you you are using. We are using, like MySQL, uh, over there, uh, over the period there, the period of time it has a circular left references, and there was a proper indicing, and I, as I told. Uh, to resolve this issue, I have to coordinate with the database. And I had to redesign the complete schema as well and and introduce an optimized index as well. This was, was, this was an artist take forward scenario, uh, for me, because I was working as a backend engineer. Issue was on the database side. The two give the proper structure I have. I have to be a proper deep dive into the current database schema. So, I also see the pattern pattern. What is the workflow and and the author understanding once? Uh, I try to read to redesign the into the schema, according accordingly without having circular references. Uh, and. Simultaneously. I also simultaneously. I also upgraded backend logic. Uh, HK situations, uh scenarios and detailed log. So, that is, capture the few few future failures. And, uh, and at last, I documented, documented the interposing. Which I had shared shared in the conference page. Uh, so, so that, uh, so that I can help the future Engineers that you in our team, the Juniors, to trouble the similar issues. And finally, I was able to. Resolve the issue where I I was reducer query latency by 40 percent. And and also eliminate alternate the intermittent failure entirely. The system of this system update uptime is improved significantly, and the client also reported the increasing increased stress in our platform of projects, um, so, and\n\n[Speaker 1]\nBefore you keep going, I have a few questions.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nUm. Okay,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo the and I just want to. I'm gonna kind of repeat some of this back to you to make sure I understand exactly the situation. Um,\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYou\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHad an API that was failing, right? Uh, it was, it was throwing errors. Um, and your task was to go in and figure out why it was throwing errors. And the first thing you figured out was that your logs didn't actually have. Um, you weren't actually logging the things that you were supposed to be logging. Right? Does that sound correct? Yeah, okay,\n\n[Speaker 4]\nSo?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHow did you know that it wasn't logging the things that needed to be logging if you didn't have the logs to know? What was going on?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nSo we had the only. We are having the basic log, like when the control is control is coming to the service. We are logging to the. We were also. We are also logging when we are. We are responding back. I basically have the time frame where, uh, when we enter the service and just before the response time. But uh. I didn't have a failures, messages, failure messages, as well as what is the exact data with query query time. Actually, so?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYou, you're saying that you didn't have any details in the Vlogs, but you still had how long the request took? Right?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYes, right, exactly. So, if you\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHave how long the request took, what did you do to figure out, um? Like what? How did you? Where did you go from there?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nAre you? It's so, so fast. I try to check whether APA has any problem. Uh, the eight I eight. They don't have any significant problem I apart from log logging. Logging was not that enough. I'll try to replicate the same issue with the staging environment, so when I try to when I try to stay sitting anywhere, I got to know. What the database, the culprit corporate the data was causing the issue. So, how did you\n\n[Speaker 1]\nFigure out it was the database that was causing the issues? If you didn't have the logs, right? That's what I'm trying to figure out.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, I try to. I try to. Yeah, I try. I try to implement the logging it, and I was changing environment. And then, I, I figured out this, uh, figure it out. The setting as a moment, it was actually the query, uh, which was calling the issue, uh. I added the, uh, adding the locks, uh, when calling the query. The query there is one time was taking to get back to the data as well, uh, from the query action.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, so it sounds like you, you didn't have the logs, but you knew the request was taking a long time. And so what he did is you went to your staging environment and you enabled debug logging so that you would have more logs to view the request. And after you had more logs, you were able to figure out that it was the database that was causing the issues. Is that correct?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYes, right, yeah, okay.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo now that you knew it was the database that was throwing the issues, what was the area you were getting back from the database?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nThat, so the database was actually low. And, uh, what do you mean the database\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWas low?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nNot low. It's slow,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSlow, okay.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, yeah.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, so you just noticed that the database was taking longer than it should have? How did you know how long it was supposed to be?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nUh, it is you are taking like 12 to 13 seconds worth taking. But, uh, when we are working on the real-time publication, uh? Ideal takes. I have so much time. I also checked check that data. I also check the data storing in our table thinking of the entries which which we had a table. So, in the production we had, we had took four tables, which, uh, which using this query and each of the table having close to thousand of thousands of Records. So, on average, I thought like, uh, this kind of data should know should not take more than more than a second or two seconds.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, question so, like when you're doing database queries, it really depends on what you're doing some database queries. Take a long amount of time and some are supposed to take a short amount of time. So, what I'm trying to understand was, this is a new issue. Where it was starting to take a long time after a feature launch, or has it been a consistent issue, and then they finally decided to go fix it?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nSo, this issue was long reported by the user, but we, we did not make any changes, uh, because it was kept in the lower priority. Uh, and it was sent as sent to me when I, when I started clearing the backlog, uh, that is where I started, uh, finding got it so, but this was a long time pending here actually,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight? So okay, so users of your application were complaining that it had. Bad response times, and your job was to go figure out how to make the response times better, not necessarily that this query was bad. You wanted to figure out how to make the the how to fix that user complaint.\n\nDiving back into the actual query itself. You said that there were cyclical dependencies that were built in over time. Um, can you explain what you mean by that?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, I mean, we had. Lives are for user stories, which which we are implemented in the future. Uh, religious. And also, we had a few of the user stories, which have to, which have to implement in the near near near past. This actually had actually more complexity to query as well. And before, uh, before when it was actually. Raise. This issue was the issuer raised. Actually delay of 8 seconds, but when it started checking, it was actually moved to 60 seconds actually. Uh, this is this is where I got to know. The recent development has also caused in the query actually.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, I think I understand. Um, but so what was the? What was the actual like, what was the item that was causing a cyclical dependency? Like, what was, what was the actual root cause of that issue?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nSo,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah,\n\n[Speaker 4]\nI mean, one of the recent user story. Um. The implementation was done in the such a way that we had to. We had to circular dependencies, uh, one table, one table from the another table. So, this was actually. Actually, a chain we are calling, and there was no. Uh, till the tree is completed from, uh, we, we was changing the calls. This is where. This is where we are causing a lot of issues. But when I was reading a redesigning my database, I got. I got another. Don't need to complete the tree. We just need to file the developer 3. Of a file level of the. File levels up to five levels. We reorganized and reorganized the data schema so. We can have a less complexity in our query actually.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, I think I understand, um. All right, let's move on to the next question. Um. So, can you tell me about a time where you needed a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job well?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nThe situation.\n\nI wanted to build their restful service over here. You using electric search and I was working for a client who needed who needed an agent basis. Was a complex search. We search which you have also are a capabilities data set. And so I had to work with the basic search implementation before, uh, but the project has demanding for advanced query optimization and and customer analyzers, and I also integration with the kibana and real-time metrics, uh, so these things I was not ever before. So, I, I, I have to love history, learn the festival, learn the.\n\nOils as well. My goal here is here! I is two designer to design and Implement the scalable search solution where? Where I can handle the queries, named queries, and multi-language data and also Dynamic filters. And. And also wanted to maintain the low latency. So, so to have this, uh, I need to have a deeper knowledge so that I can choose write the right Technologies and write coding strategies,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAnd I\n\n[Speaker 4]\nCan have a low latency. Accuracy. And I realized that dialysis search was not only the only the requirement. I was. I. I also also learned more deeper. Uh, deeper, into the loose and's interverse, where we take the tokenized intervals. Uh, token strategy. And it tells, uh, it is. I mean, how to how to invert the indexes and how to check the custom analyzers using stemming and synchronization synonyming filter synonyming filtering. So, so I can improve the relevant scoring, and uh, I'll also learn base marking and different, uh, query types.\n\nAnd, uh, and I also tuned them into better performance, uh, performance. And I also learned something about the kibana dashboard as well, so that, uh so, visualization real quick,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm. Let's I want to kind of like dive into some of these things. So let's, let's try to like, keep it a little more, uh, like focused on one thing, right? So, I think you said elasticsearch was one of the things you had to learn about, right?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, so.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhat? Why did you need to learn more about elasticsearch specifically?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, um, yeah, because I had to work on a previous project where I I was using the basic search implementation. Uh, but Alex research, but Alexis search was not used at all in past. This and this API, which was creating which I, which we have to use analysis search, uh, over here.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, so you you had to use elasticsearch for one of the apis that your your first search function that your old team or your an old project needed to use. So, how did you go about learning how to use elasticsearch more effectively?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, so for the same. Uh, I, I had to learn about the. Uh, in Lucian intervals. And, uh, so, where I can use the tokenization strategies, right? How I can. But how\n\n[Speaker 1]\nDid you learn about it? Like, what did you do in order to learn more about elasticsearch? I understand what you had to learn, but I understand how you earned it.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, yes, by style. Step down. What are the, what are things are needed in the electric search, and uh? What would be the help will be for the helpful to implement in this project? And, uh, then I went and had, and I went to the my manager and with this list and asked?\n\nWorkshop. I run this app and and he knows we do. We didn't. Also, as you know, we didn't have any workshops. So, my manager approved for the external Workshop as well, uh, where, whereas I went, I went to the external Workshop. Saw some of the audition documentations. Official documentations on the Galaxy search. That is how I started learning learning on the electric research,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll right, so you? So, basically, the first thing you did was you went to your manager and said, I want to learn how to use elasticsearch. Um, and I assume you told him why?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYes, I, I told him, why? Because I wanted to create this restful apis, which has advanced, not advanced search mechanism. So,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWe\n\n[Speaker 2]\nHad a\n\n[Speaker 4]\nLarge number of data sets. Where I had you told him that elastic could be better? And, and I'm not aware of it. Okay, so\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThen? You. There was no internal Workshop at the company that you were working on for how to use elasticsearch, so you went, and you got to prove to attend an external Workshop. So, what was this external Workshop?\n\nIt's, yeah. So, this external version\n\n[Speaker 4]\nWork basically online Workshop. Uh, so I used online tools to learn about the electric search and what are the methods methodology we can use? So this, I can. I try to learn from the external platform.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nAnd\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, in the in the workshop, how do they have you go about learning how to use elasticsearch? Like, what was the, what was the difference? How did the training work?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, that basically that the first they are explain. But they playing the concepts of the courses of the concepts and what is the electric steps and what? What? What do you need to analyze that in a real-time scenario, and uh, and what to start on the road or role-based learning path, and they told that what this, what is the elastic search engineering have, and what are the concepts, indexing queries, and uh, cluster design and performing?\n\nWhen collecting on the large Matrix and? And APM data. Using how to integrate the kibana lock? Log stat and. And they started with the Hands-On lab and the products where they helped me to build a search applications from scratch. Uh, they also. Showing how we can automate in the query using domain specifically specific language and and how we can configize and monitor the performance using kibana, and how, how it how it works in a real world in a data set? Can simulate the, simulate the production scenarios, and they also help me in the certificate education possible possible in the future as well.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll right. So, so you learned about elasticsearch at the workshop? It sounds. Sounds good. It sounds like the workshop was probably a great way to actually learn about it since they made you do a bunch of different stuff. Um, so once you learned about elasticsearch. How did that? How did that go in the workshop? Like, what did you were you able to create? The the API that you wanted to create for search?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYes, uh, in the workshop, I was not able to create, but after the after the workshop, I will able to create the LS6 search. And, and also the solution which I created reducer query. This response, almost by 60 percent, and it also supported the multi-lang, multi-lang language search, uh, and I also able to achieve a creation of kibana. Me to also understand the elasticsearch in the deeper way. So, this was my, and this was my major experience where I have to learn with some learn something to. Everyone implementation.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll right. Well, thank you for that story. Um, let's move on, and I'm going to ask you another one. Um. Can you describe a time? When you needed the influence appear. Who had a differing opinion about a shared goal.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nIn your one, can you repeat the question one second, sure,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm? I need you to describe a time. Uh, where you needed to influence a peer. Uh, who had a differing opinion about a shared goal?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nOkay. And yes, I can think of one scenario. Uh, when I was working at ips Corporation, uh, so I was actually tasked with the optimum Legacy model, uh, model. Actually, it was, uh, it was handing the user based user based role access across the multiple services, uh, basically, we had multiple services and.\n\nApis as well. We, we, we want to make sure different users with the different roles, uh, will have us have the access. Only for the few Services. No, not all of them, so we want to cook. Want to control based on the roads based on the roles they have? And so over here. We had to basically basically improve the performance, so the the system was already existing. And we also, and we want to also maintain the maintain without disturbing the existing functionalities, and from improving the performance. Comments when we are discussing one of the peer.\n\nUsing the condition logic. Where we can have where we can control a layer directly and? With the. With this role-based handling, I was a I was not very, uh, I was not okay with it, but I, uh, because I was believing that this could be increased, uh, the the technical depth, because because we are adding a lot of technical logic in our controller, uh, layer in in it can make the future. I can make a few future also very critical, so we had. Multiple roles in place actually in the future. So I needed to actually. Uh, so I needed to actually influence my peer over here so we can. So we can adapt to the modular, scalable approach. Because we can, you can. We can use a strategy pattern, and we can also keep shared goals so that, uh, we can deliver the timely and and system test stability. Is also intact. When I propose this idea, I was. Was not very okay because he was thinking. The strategy pattern might be delayed. And. Instead of telling him. The strategy pattern is a better way. What I try what I try here is. Uh, I, I insulate the design, design, meeting, and, and we can have the paid program. I I try to walk through the real-time scenarios where I proposed a proposed a current current current patch, which which could break, which could break the under some edge cases. Some of the Educators. Uh, when we had nested roles or so,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHold on real quick. Hold on real quick, um? I kind of want to before you go talk too much about the actual technical implementation of it. I, I just want to talk about, like, kind of, you know, dive into a few more bits of this before you, you know, tell me more. Um. So you, you said that you, you're trying to implement, um? Different roles for your account. Is that right?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nYeah, and so\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThose those roles. I, I'm assuming you guys are using AWS? Or you're using Azure or something.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nNo, no, no, we are not using AWS instant. We are handling, uh, our application. It was our springboard application and, uh, inside the springboot application, we are we we were using the annotations, uh, for the role-based access and particular Services. So, so?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, so you're using spring boot for for your services, but when you say roll based access, what are the roles that teams are? Using. Right, so\n\n[Speaker 4]\nWe have multiple roles like admin inside admin itself.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, so these are roles similar to like. I am a software engineer like someone might be a manager. Someone might be a director, etc, etc. Is that correct? Yeah,\n\n[Speaker 4]\nOkay, exactly? And\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo. In, just like a couple sentences, what was the, what was the thing you were trying to improve about the way you used roles?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nSo, we have already have the roles which, which was a legacy system. Uh, so now, we we are moving out out of the Legacy system, move out from the Legacy system because it was slow.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay,\n\n[Speaker 4]\nAnd when we are implementing when we are implementing the new strategies we are conflicting, uh? On the strategies between me, me, and my peer. So, so\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHold on real quick when you say that you have conflicting strategies when moving off of the Legacy system. What were? Uh, what was this specific item that was, um? You know in contention?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nUm. So, basically, we should not. Uh, we should. We should increase. I, I'll be changing at this time and decrease the latency that was a major problem, uh, existing model. Okay,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo the\n\n[Speaker 4]\nSo, you're trying to move\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOn to the new system in order to decrease latency, right? Like, that's is decreased latency, and was there another item?\n\nWe also have majorly\n\n[Speaker 4]\nHave we had latency as a problem, all right. So that\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWas, that was the big one is you wanted to move off of the old system for latency reasons, all right. So,\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYes, no.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, what did you want to do in order to? Decrease the latency when you move to the new system.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, when, when we are where disc discussing the possible approaches, uh, move to the new system. My peer was, as it was on, to improve the. To improve this, she he was suggesting a quick path using a using a condition logic and direct\n\n[Speaker 1]\nControl control layer. Branching logic in the control area in order to help improve latency by reducing the amount of code that needed to be traversed. Perhaps? Yes, and what was he and what was your yeah? What was your recommendation for how to fix it?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nMy recommendation would be like, not not to not to write the logic in the control country in the control controller layer instead. Uh, my goal was to have a study strategy pattern. So, so that I already noticed they are hierarchical? Application. Our application, so strategy application would have much more a better iPhone actually. If we directly add if we directly add in it this in the control layer, the maintaining would be very hard and difficult. Because we had a hierarchy structure.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo\n\n[Speaker 4]\nWhen we revoke\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo the, it sounds like the. Um. You thought your method was better because it'll be more maintainable in the future, right?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYes, okay. So how\n\n[Speaker 1]\nDid you like what? What specific actions did you take, um? To help convince. You know, your peer, like, how did you guys get to a consensus at the end? Like,\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, first, I tried to walk through the real real scenario real world scenario, where? We can have a breaking news in the breaking the strategy. I try to show how to how hierarchical our roles roles are. So that he can understand where we when we are revoking, uh, revoking a room how much storage change we need to make if we have, if we had to go with the logic change, we again we should test the entire module. I, I, and I also believe the lightweight prototype lightweight prototype using using strategic pattern. So, so I can show him that I, I can show how? How can we use the predict predicate the basic filter filter filtering and how and show him how it could be looked? Clean the separation of corners and ex and extending in the future so?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYou basically showed him why your approach was better. Is that right? So\n\n[Speaker 4]\nDid\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHe? Did he agree after you showed him? Uh, that your approach was in fact better.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nI actually, he asked me a lot of questions during the. This flow, and he and he also want to try to prove adding the country, adding the control logic is better, uh, but we took once, uh, once at one step at a time, uh. So, then we try to list what could be, what could be the better approach? So we created a conflict confluence document. Depending what a court case and. And which case, and what would be the better approach? So end of this I at the end of this? Um, we were able to get almost 80 percent 80 of cases. Our strategy of using using the strategy strategy over like? During the strategy pattern was a better pattern and the better way. And so\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhat was the actual tangible results that your customers felt based off of this change?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nSo, then, when we was implementing the strategy pattern, so the refactor module actually reduce the code complexity by 40%, uh? And we also improve the test coverage as well because we added just. We added it in the strategy pattern, right? Uh, we had to add no cases to the strategy pattern, and whenever we had a new role, we we need a. We need to add very less stress cases and. Able to add a pass security as well. How did\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYou manage to quantify the code complexity reduction?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, we use we. We use the sonar queue for this, the complex, uh, the the complexity we, uh, which was there before the recent implementation, uh, we tried to compare, uh, we tried to compare the sonar Cube reports.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay.\n\n[Speaker 5]\nCool. That's interesting.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nUh, and and user also reported, uh, we had a latency issue, right, and? And we also improved by. We also improved by 70 percent.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYou had a 70 latency Improvement just from implementing a different question.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nA\n\n[Speaker 1]\nCandler. How much of that was attributed to using the strategies rather than just moving off of the Legacy system?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nUh, we didn't actually implement the complete complete model using the controller layer. Strategy, but but a high level. It was just improving 30 to 40 percent.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, about 30 to 40 of the latency decreases because of this change.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nYes, fine. Cool,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll right? Well, that is all the questions I have. Um, do you have any questions for me?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, I do have one question.\n\nUh, like, what would be, uh, like, what would be like first three to six months for HD? One role look for new joiners?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nTypically the way that Amazon operates with new hires is we try to get them to hit the ground running. So, the first three to six months will probably be a lot of trainings to try to get you to understand. Uh, kind of how we do things internally build systems. We use package management, etc, etc. And then, basically, we tried to get you to hit the ground running, um. Amazon definitely values delivery in their sde ones, but also, we have a really high bar for the work that is actually being delivered. So, the first three to six months will probably be a lot of you have a lot of coding tasks to complete yet. You're getting a lot of feedback on. You know, raising the bar at how, how do you code things at a Amazon appropriate level? Um, to make sure that we can sustain it for the long term. So?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nYeah,\n\n[Speaker 4]\nWell, okay, yeah. Cool! Yeah, well, if you have any other questions then, uh, good luck in your next interview. Yeah, thank you so much!

While they showed some initiative in learning new technologies like Elasticsearch, their responses lacked the depth and clarity expected for technical problem-solving scenarios. The candidate struggled to articulate specific situations coherently and provided inconsistent details when probed, particularly around database troubleshooting methodologies and technical decision-making processes.\n\n## Overall Assessment\n\n**Rating: 2 - Inclined Not to Hire**\n\nThe candidate falls below the leadership principle bar with significant gaps in demonstrating Amazon's core values. While they have relevant technical experience, their ability to communicate complex scenarios clearly and demonstrate systematic problem-solving approaches is concerning for an Amazon SDE role.\n\n## Dive Deep\n\nThe candidate attempted to demonstrate deep diving through a database performance issue but struggled to articulate their systematic approach clearly when questioned. They described working on a hospital software system with patient record retrieval failures, claiming to identify circular database references and schema issues that improved query latency by 40%. However, when pressed for specifics about their debugging methodology, their explanations became inconsistent and unclear, particularly around how they initially identified the database as the root cause without proper logging in place.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Showed persistence in troubleshooting a complex database performance issue\n- (+) Implemented concrete improvements including schema redesign and optimized indexing\n- (+) Documented solutions for future team members to reference\n- (+) Achieved measurable results with 40% query latency improvement\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Inconsistent explanation of debugging methodology when probed for details\n- (-) Unclear initial problem identification process without adequate logging\n- (-) Struggled to coherently explain the root cause analysis steps\n- (-) Failed to demonstrate systematic approach to complex problem resolution\n\n## Learn and Be Curious\n\nThe candidate showed some initiative in learning Elasticsearch for a project requiring advanced search capabilities beyond their existing knowledge. They described seeking manager approval for external training and attending an online workshop to gain deeper understanding of Lucene, tokenization, and custom analyzers. They successfully implemented a search solution that reduced query response time by 60% and supported multi-language functionality, demonstrating practical application of their learning.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Proactively identified knowledge gaps in Elasticsearch technology\n- (+) Sought manager approval and pursued external training opportunities  \n- (+) Successfully applied workshop learnings to implement working search solution\n- (+) Achieved concrete improvements with 60% response time reduction\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Did not demonstrate continuous learning or staying current with industry trends\n- (-) Limited evidence of learning from failures or seeking feedback\n- (-) No examples of self-directed exploration beyond immediate project needs\n- (-) Lacked depth in explaining how they built upon initial learning\n\n## Earns Trust\n\nThe candidate provided limited evidence for earning trust behaviors throughout the interview. When describing the role-based access control project, they mentioned working with a peer who had differing opinions but focused primarily on technical arguments rather than demonstrating trust-building behaviors. They claimed to create confluence documentation and use metrics (SonarQube) to support their position, but did not clearly articulate how they built relationships or handled accountability in challenging situations.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Created documentation to support technical decisions and share knowledge\n- (+) Used objective metrics (SonarQube) to validate technical approaches\n- (+) Worked collaboratively with peer to reach consensus through structured analysis\n- (+) Showed willingness to engage in technical discussions and defend positions\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) No clear examples of admitting mistakes or taking responsibility for failures\n- (-) Limited evidence of transparent communication during difficult situations  \n- (-) Did not demonstrate building trust across different organizational levels\n- (-) Lacked examples showing accountability when things went wrong\n\n## Technical Assessment\n\nThe candidate demonstrates solid technical knowledge across Java, Spring Boot, databases, and search technologies but struggles with clear technical communication and systematic problem-solving approaches. Their experience spans multiple domains including healthcare software, search implementations, and role-based access control systems, showing breadth of exposure. However, their explanations often lack precision and become unclear when pressed for specific details, particularly around debugging methodologies and root cause analysis.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Broad technical experience across Java ecosystem and modern frameworks\n- (+) Hands-on experience with performance optimization and system improvements\n- (+) Successfully delivered measurable improvements in multiple projects\n- (+) Experience with both legacy system migration and greenfield development\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Unclear communication of technical concepts when questioned in detail\n- (-) Inconsistent explanations of problem-solving methodologies\n- (-) Difficulty articulating systematic approaches to complex technical issues\n- (-) Limited demonstration of deep technical expertise in any specific area\n\n## Communication & Interpersonal Skills\n\nThe candidate's communication skills present significant concerns for a collaborative environment like Amazon. While they can describe high-level project scenarios, they struggle to maintain coherent explanations when interviewers probe for specific details or challenge their approaches. Their responses often become fragmented and inconsistent, particularly when explaining technical debugging processes or interpersonal influence situations, making it difficult to assess the validity of their claimed experiences.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Comfortable discussing technical projects and sharing experiences\n- (+) Shows enthusiasm for technology and problem-solving challenges  \n- (+) Demonstrates basic ability to work in team environments\n- (+) Willing to engage in technical discussions and defend positions\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Inconsistent and unclear explanations when pressed for details\n- (-) Difficulty maintaining coherent narrative threads during questioning\n- (-) Limited demonstration of effective influence and persuasion techniques\n- (-) Struggles to articulate complex scenarios in a structured, logical manner\n\n## Red Flags\n\n• **Inconsistent Technical Explanations**: The candidate provided contradictory details about their database debugging approach, initially claiming lack of proper logging but then explaining how they used logs to identify issues\n\n• **Communication Clarity**: Significant difficulty maintaining clear, coherent explanations when questioned, raising concerns about their ability to communicate effectively in a fast-paced technical environment\n\n• **Weak STAR Examples**: Most behavioral examples lacked clear structure and specific details, making it difficult to assess actual leadership behaviors and technical competencies\n\n• **Limited Depth**: When probed for deeper technical understanding or specific methodologies, responses became vague and unclear rather than demonstrating genuine expertise\n\n## Recommendation Summary\n\n**Do not proceed with this candidate.** While they demonstrate some technical experience and initiative in learning new technologies, the significant gaps in communication clarity and systematic problem-solving approach present concerns for success in Amazon's collaborative, high-bar environment. The candidate would benefit from developing clearer communication skills and more structured approaches to technical problem-solving before being ready for an Amazon SDE role."}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5,"cache_creation_input_tokens":9881,"cache_read_input_tokens":54574,"output_tokens":1685}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"5bd65c63-7914-4af4-a7b3-11ee01e624da","timestamp":"2025-08-21T16:56:45.208Z"}

You know, just getting into the swing of the day?\n    12→\n    13→[Speaker 3]\n    14→Yeah.\n    15→\n    16→[Speaker 1]\n    17→All right. Oh no, you're on the west coast as well. Yeah,\n    18→\n    19→[Speaker 2]\n    20→Yep, out here in Seattle.\n    21→\n    22→Hey, sorry,\n    23→\n    24→[Speaker 1]\n    25→My chime crashed there.

Yeah, chime is not my favorite piece of equipment.\n    29→\n    30→All right, um, so sorry, what's where were we? Um. So? My name's Ben. It's nice to meet you. Um. The way this interview is kind of kind of go is we're going to do some quick introductions. Um, and then you and I are just going to kind of have a conversation for an hour, um, where I really kind of want to dig into some of the details of the stories that you're telling me. Um, and then I'll leave a little bit of time at the end for us to, you know, for you to ask me any questions. Um, we're not going to do any coding in in this interview. Okay. So, this interview might not last the full hour. I mean, that's perfectly okay.\n    31→\n    32→[Speaker 3]\n    33→Okay, um?\n    34→\n    35→[Speaker 2]\n    36→Cool, so why don't we started off, and uh, have you tell a little bit? Tell me a little about yourself.\n    37→\n    38→[Speaker 1]\n    39→Yeah, so I'm Harry. I'm a recent graduate from, uh? Lesson, Washington University with a bachelor's in computer science. Uh, I really do love programming. I do competitive programming as a hobby where I am ranked, uh, in the top 0.5 percent of 700, 000 roughly participants on leap code, so I have some strong tournament finishes, including, uh, finishing top 10.\n    40→\n    41→Say 10, 000 participants with multiple top 50 and top 100 finishes.\n    42→\n    43→[Speaker 3]\n    44→Uh,\n    45→\n    46→[Speaker 1]\n    47→Early in my University experience I. Joined a machine learning research group where I initially worked on unpaid projects, just research projects. By my third year, my professor offered me an internship. Uh, opportunity, which I took and. At that time, I was able to work on a variety of tasks, including, you know, building machine learning pipelines. Writing documentation and even building web apps to deploy trained models. All of this was done in a collaborative environment where I worked closely with co-workers, managers, and clients, right?\n    48→\n    49→I also had a role like outside of academics at modest, where I built a end-to-end web application. Um. That supported features such as? Booking appointments, making purchases, you know, buying car parts? Uh, actually, processing the payments and also. Uh,\n    50→\n    51→[Speaker 3]\n    52→Like\n    53→\n    54→[Speaker 1]\n    55→Handling some internal business logic, like updating inventory spreadsheets. Do love the field of computer science. I love all the you know, fascinated by all the different problems in the field and the elegant Solutions that they require. I aspire to grow into roles where I can contribute to. The kinds of, and, you know, hopefully eventually lead the kinds of teams that are working on these projects in the real world in three columns. Yeah, that's, that's me.\n    56→\n    57→[Speaker 2]\n    58→Cool all right, um? So, my name is Ben. Uh, I'm a senior software engineer here at. Asbx, specifically on the golden bath team. Um, I've been at Amazon for, like, eight years. I want to say. Um.\n    59→\n    60→And sorry. I people were yelling at me for some issue that's currently going on. Um, gosh, I'm trying to ignore it, um? So I've been named them for 8 years. I've been kind of all over the place I originally started off in Alexa, you know, eight years ago, when it was still cool, um, working on communication software over there. So, like, how do we actually route calls from, you know, device to device got a few patents over there? To primer, so it built a lot of the Drone delivery business software. A lot of the on the ground stuff. As well as some of the the vehicle interaction stuff. Um. From there, I ended up moving over into asbx, which is kind of like Builder tools. Where I've had multiple different things in my ownership. I've had operator tooling, so how do we actually enable operators to better? Uh, serve their services during an event in a safe manner. And then, more recently, uh, the golden path team, which is kind of responsible for dictating, not dictating, uh, recommending. Services should be architecting. How services should be architected and developed so that you have the best outcomes. For the general populace, as well as publishing things like caveats for. When do ignore recommendations when to use additional toolings, etc, etc? So, you know, things like these is the right thought throttling systems you need to use. These are the ways that you set up load balancing, etc, etc.\n    61→\n    62→All right. So the way that this interview is, like, I said, gonna work because I'm just going to ask you a few questions, and we're just gonna have have a general conversation. Um, I'm gonna be taking notes over here. So, if you see me looking over here, typing that is. Perfectly fine. I'm still paying attention to you. All right, so. Let's start it off here. So, first of all? Uh, can you tell me about a time when you were trying to understand a complex system on your team? Oh, actually. Yeah, you are not an industry hire. Are you?\n    63→\n    64→[Speaker 1]\n    65→Um, sorry. What is, does that mean I'm not hired? I'm a new grad. Yeah,\n    66→\n    67→[Speaker 2]\n    68→I\n    69→\n    70→[Speaker 1]\n    71→Do have for my industry experience, uh, a story like that, yeah.\n    72→\n    73→[Speaker 2]\n    74→I I usually. So, when I prepare for interviews, I pull a question out, and then I, um, I just kind of ask it so I don't have to do any as much thinking. But since you are a new hire, this question is maybe a little bit harder for you to.\n    75→\n    76→[Speaker 1]\n    77→Uh,\n    78→\n    79→[Speaker 2]\n    80→Come up with a good answer. So, let me pick a different one real quick.\n    81→\n    82→[Speaker 1]\n    83→All right,\n    84→\n    85→[Speaker 2]\n    86→Um? Can you tell me about a problem you had to solve that required in-depth thought and Analysis?\n    87→\n    88→[Speaker 1]\n    89→Um, yeah, so? When I was working. So, while during my time at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory? I worked on a project.\n    90→\n    91→Um, essentially. Emulate, but we were building machine learning models to emulate the outputs of Earth system models. Which? All right, incredibly slow and computationally expensive to run. So, at the time, we had a suite of Legacy research tools. Which were only accessible to a command line interface. At that point, I was tasked with building a web application to integrate these, uh, existing tools and make them accessible from a website. Um.\n    92→\n    93→During my my work to integrate the optimize tool. I noticed. Essentially.\n    94→\n    95→Tool itself. When I called its API, it was very. It went extremely slowly, and I noticed this because I had set up a loading bar and a live graphing widget. To track the progress of the tool in real time. Uh, so. I noticed that for a sample batch of, say, 100 points, it took. Around three minutes to run, whereas I would have expected for that data size, uh, to maybe for it, maybe taking the range of 10 to 20 seconds around that scale, so? This prompted me to actually go ahead and look into the problem where I mean looking at the optimization function itself, where I found that. The code was like the the function was being implemented in a singular manner, such as the points were being processed, one by one rather than a batched manner, which was much faster and in my opinion standard. Uh, so because I didn't know who wrote the code, I brought this up at the next team meeting. My teammate, who had written the code, pushed back on me, saying that from his empirical tests, he found that, uh, the singular method yielded better results and was more accurate, he said. He believed that to be due to the fact that during optimization those points weren't interfering with each other. However, from my understanding of the code, and you know the functions that it calls specifically optimization using Adam W?\n    96→\n    97→Actually, there was no interference. And because of that, the two methods should be computationally identical. I explained this, but my teammates and manager weren't fully convinced. So, at that point, I mentioned that I could write. A test that proved that the two were computationally identical. In addition, you know, my team asked for some. My teammates asked for some other things, like just a graphing feature, which. I,\n    98→\n    99→[Speaker 3]\n   100→I\n   101→\n   102→[Speaker 1]\n   103→Mentioned, I would produce a graph of the results as well. So, my manager, thinking that this was, uh, worthwhile task, he basically.\n   104→\n   105→[Speaker 3]\n   106→Uh,\n   107→\n   108→[Speaker 1]\n   109→Assign this to me for the next week. Uh, and then over the next two days. I sort of wrote this test, and also, you know. Built the graph, and I presented this at the next team meeting, so the test was essentially a test of equivalency. So, at each point in this iterative optimization process at each epic, it would compare the it would run through the same batch of starting points, uh.\n   110→\n   111→Singular and to a batch method, and then it would cast for equality and also graph that, and I presented the test of this manner to my team at the next team meeting, which was enough to convince everyone that the two were actually identical. As a result. We were able to switch from the slower singular method, the faster batched method which improved the user experience by, uh.\n   112→\n   113→Optimization for a batch of roughly. 200 points, roughly 100 points from. Three minutes to just under 20 seconds, which is a speed up of nearly 10x, so 100 is a fairly standard, uh, use case. Yeah, and I suppose. Yeah, that's the story. No,\n   114→\n   115→[Speaker 2]\n   116→That mean, that makes sense. So.\n   117→\n   118→That's interest.\n   119→\n   120→You honestly did a really great job of explaining that, so I'm kind of at a loss for kind of figuring out follow-up questions here, um.\n   121→\n   122→What is your?\n   123→\n   124→So, we'll in the end, what was the outcome they did? Did you? How did you like explain to your team more about this, like, did you create? Yeah, go ahead.\n   125→\n   126→[Speaker 1]\n   127→Yeah, um, I showed them the test, which was a I showed them the exact code.\n   128→\n   129→[Speaker 2]\n   130→Uh,\n   131→\n   132→[Speaker 1]\n   133→Which was not super complicated. It was just, uh, you initialize this batch of points. You run the functions in parallel, so you step. At each step, you step it through the first function and then the second function, and you compare quality. And then, you also graph because they just requested this. You graph both points, and so we have a graph that you can track as well. And you know, at any point, the the two points are not within some really tiny margin of error, because you know, this floating Point error we're dealing with weights here? I think the error margin I set was one e to the negative eight somewhere in that range, so just completely. Tiny margin of error, so if it was not within that? It. Would the test would Mark it? And it. Notice, you know, there were no reports of, you know, for this exact instance, there were no reports of deviations from each other and the graphs were directly on top of each other and for a machine learning sort of like a training run. This is completely improbable to ever happen. If the two operations are not identical, right? So, this test? Essentially proved definitively that the two were computationally identical, and when my teammates saw this, they saw the graph they saw the code. It was enough to convince them\n   134→\n   135→[Speaker 2]\n   136→Cool. I'm not terribly familiar with machine learning. Quite Frank with you, which is not a problem, the I guess what I'm curious about is? Was there? You were able to convince this one teammate that, um, you know this, this other way was, you know, computationally equivalent, um? What was the customer benefit of? Actually, yeah, go ahead.\n   137→\n   138→[Speaker 1]\n   139→Yeah, sorry. Um, the customer benefit is that I am designing this, uh? The designing in building this web application for customer use, right? Because the idea of the web application, uh, is it's it's for it's for internal use, but it's also it's mainly for, uh, the use of our customers who maybe aren't that, technically, uh. With, you know, python, or these interfaces, and for them to be able to access our tools through a web application rather than the command line application. It's just a great ease of use for them, and they also don't have to read any documentation or any of that stuff so. When they? You know, train a sample of a hundred points here, like, optimize a sample of 100 points. They would have to wait three minutes for that optimization to finish. After this Improvement, they would only need to wait, uh, 20 seconds to get the same level of accuracy. So, that's nearly a 10x speed up. General use case, oftentimes the way that. Uh, basically, the flow of this operation tool is you set your scenarios. You fix your inputs, and then you might want to try like a bunch of different kinds of scenarios, so you might take the same or different batch of 100 points, and you want to run it through a bunch of different scenarios in all in the same setting, right? So, if the optimization run takes only 20 seconds. You can accomplish that a lot quicker. That's, that's the benefit to the customer.\n   140→\n   141→[Speaker 2]\n   142→No, that makes a lot of sense. It makes a lot of sense, so.\n   143→\n   144→Is there anything you would have done differently, or were there other places that you could have applied this learning?\n   145→\n   146→[Speaker 1]\n   147→Um.\n   148→\n   149→Um, in this in this particular story.\n   150→\n   151→I believe I handled it quite. Well, I mean, it's kind of part of why I kicked it as a story to tell, but? I, um, in some of. You know, in my earlier sort of like? Uh, when I was just onboarding onto this project. Uh, I one thing. That I could have sort of learned more about, like, I could have read the internals of the code a bit more deeply before I began interfacing with the tools because I think that that would have prevented some other like hiccups in the future. What I did. Was I sort of learned the uh interface, but I really just learned them as interfaces. I didn't bother to break open their implementation, uh? If I'd done that, I would have had actually more familiarity with the behavior of these interfaces, a lot of which they were documented. But maybe they weren't documented that well, and if I had taken that extra step to, you know, dive just a little bit deeper than I could have, uh, I could have saved myself some time. Yeah, I think the\n   152→\n   153→[Speaker 2]\n   154→I mean, it's always interesting because these are. Having success stories are really, in my mind, a opportunity to understand where you need to grow and realize that you have done some growing. Um, so knowing knowing that, like, do you think you'd be better prepared to handle a similar scenario in the future?\n   155→\n   156→[Speaker 1]\n   157→Oh, um.\n   158→\n   159→[Speaker 2]\n   160→Thinking,\n   161→\n   162→[Speaker 1]\n   163→Uh, I'm thinking about essentially. Where, like, because a few things is one, the reason that I didn't. I had to bring up the, uh, this problem in the team meeting was because I didn't know who had written the code,\n   164→\n   165→[Speaker 2]\n   166→Right? Uh, so I, I\n   167→\n   168→[Speaker 1]\n   169→Was, I was unable to sort of, like, have a one-on-one with them. I'm not sure if that caused the person to become a little, uh, like, I don't know, defensive. Yeah, defensive, uh? Because originally, when I was when I brought it up, they were convinced that Dakota had written for the batch implementation was wrong. Uh, and. I'm not. I'm not sure if that came out of a place of defense in this, or just, you know, General General curiosity. Maybe I could have approached it a bit better by, uh, getting to really. Like, I said, if I had come to understand the internals. Maybe I would have also known who who was responsible for building them, you know who, who would just sort of ask? Each of those things, and if I'd resolved that individually, maybe I could have gotten away with not even writing the test, right? Then again, having that test there is like, it's everyone is, is like with that test there. Everyone is quite sort of confident with removing this old functionality. Absolutely. The\n   170→\n   171→[Speaker 2]\n   172→Test isn't necessarily a bad thing. Yeah, I do think that there is. It does make sense that maybe there's a way a learning about how to work with, um? Even if not this person. But like, you know, you're gonna have to work with tons of different types of people, right?\n   173→\n   174→[Speaker 1]\n   175→Yeah, yeah.\n   176→\n   177→[Speaker 2]\n   178→Anyway, just a thought, all right, so? Let's go ahead and move on to to another story. Um. Can you tell me about a time? When you realize you needed a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job well.\n   179→\n   180→[Speaker 1]\n   181→Who let me think on that for a bit.\n   182→\n   183→Deeper level of subject matter expertise? Yeah, I mean so. When I was working at is another one of my internships at Pacific Northwest, National Laboratory was a different project. I was working on a project.\n   184→\n   185→[Speaker 4]\n   186→We.\n   187→\n   188→[Speaker 1]\n   189→Essentially. Benchmarking two machine learning algorithms. Uh, against each other, uh. And these machine learning algorithms were basically doing. Uh, modeling and control of temperatures within residential buildings. So, I was responsible for our clients proprietary algorithm, which was differential. Differential predictive control, right? So roughly two weeks before, uh, we had to deliver our end of quarter deadline and mine. Keep in mind this project, it was a project that was really sort of. Always had tight deadlines because our clients were quite pushy with the amount of features that they wanted done. And you know, the dates that they wanted them shipped by. So, it was always rather.\n   190→\n   191→Sorry, rather type deadlines on that project. So, roughly two weeks before the end of quarter deadline, um? I was peer programming with my teammate, who was responsible for the Deep reinforcement learning side of things, which is the other algorithm that was being benchmarked, and we were working where Pew programming together, because we were working on integration tests. Between our two modules. So during that session. I noticed. Uh, just what, what? Walk me over, uh? Part in his code again. One of the normalization, like there was a place where the code was normalizing. To a range that was slightly outside of our defined protocol. Uh, we realized that it didn't. Show up in our tests because this is something that happened in the middle of the pipeline. So, the the end pipeline sort of results still fell into the expected range of our tests so? I sort of. I pointed out the problem. Him and we, we discussed it. We verified that it actually was an error. We, uh, we fixed it. But we also considered because it wasn't a simple fix because this had. Uh, a lot of implications for our tests that have already been run right, so invalidated a lot of our previous. Test results. Uh, so realizing this, we immediately notified our manager who set up a team meeting where we sort of, you know, explained the issue. And what we believed were all the implications and the benchmarks that needed to be redone as a result.\n   192→\n   193→Our manager, you know? Seeing this, he reassigned our priorities, and he asked me to work with my teammate on resolving this issue before resuming any of our other tasking because these were essentially our core deliverables, and we were quite short on time at that point, uh, so. I collaborated with my teammate to fix the air, and but also to put in more, uh, reliable tests. Uh, so that similar cases would not, uh, happen again in the future. And then we also re-ran the experiment that were affected by this. Uh, air. And.\n   194→\n   195→As a result, we were able to deliver our. Deliverables, which is, which is that end of quarter report? Uh, on time, although you know I had to work a little bit of overtime and? My manager talked to our clients and got them to sort of push back some extra features to the next quarter. And when we delivered that report, they were satisfied with the results. So? The reason that that is a story about, you know? More domain expertise because it's because the normalization it was specifically related to.\n   196→\n   197→Uh. Some residential Building like HVAC knowledge, which uh our collaborators were mainly responsible. I guess you could do some quotes responsible, uh, for providing the domain knowledge on that part, but I found that as someone who was, you know, responsible for the implementation? Uh, lacking a full understanding of those details often led to either. Similar issues like this in my code. Or just an inability to spot these immediately in other people's code so? Yeah, that was. That was an like, I believe that if I had taken that time to, uh, sort of. They not only just into, you know, the machine learning side of things, but also try to really understand, you know, uh, the domain knowledge in those residential buildings. I could have caught this issue. Uh, sooner wrote better tests, you know to, to identify possible issues sooner. Uh, and just generally had a smoother time building this price project. Yeah. Okay.\n   198→\n   199→[Speaker 2]\n   200→I'm going to repeat it back. You just to make sure I understand exactly the story, so you, you have a machine learning algorithm that you needed to Benchmark as a part of it was for the research laboratory, which did building temperatures. I'm not really sure I\n   201→\n   202→[Speaker 1]\n   203→Got that part. Um, so the Lisa's lab toys, specifically, it's a large place. Um, the team specifically was a neuromancer team, and they were. They were developing this new sort of control algorithm because the field standard at the time was deep reinforcement learning, right?\n   204→\n   205→Algorithm called differential predictive control, which they believe could perform better in these residential buildings. So, we were tasked with benchmarking, though, so essentially, under similar conditions, similar data set sizes and training. Compute allowances. To compare comparing the performances of these two algorithms is the\n   206→\n   207→[Speaker 2]\n   208→Idea. So, so is the idea that, like, you have a predictive algorithm that runs on? Heaters to figure out when to turn on and off.\n   209→\n   210→[Speaker 1]\n   211→Yeah, so there were physical like, uh, depending on the system. They're like, essentially, physical things like valves levers. These are. These are some books that are adjusted by control. This is a two-part process. It's modeling and control, so the first part was to train something called a state space model to essentially predict what a certain the effect that a certain action would have on an environment like, say, the temperature. Like, if I perform this action, I tweak this vowel. I expect that in the next time slot. That the, uh, the room will be at this higher temperature, right? So? So that is trade on. Oh,\n   212→\n   213→[Speaker 2]\n   214→Oh, so I'm just trying to make sure I understand. So, it actually sounds kind of interesting. So, like the HVAC system itself they have, I assume some random Swedish software. You can configure the building and all the valves and stuff, and then it has. Anything else you can kind of mess or like an aircraft simulator, right? You can kind of figure out what's going to happen based off of the inputs you give it right. Standard control Theory stuff?\n   215→\n   216→[Speaker 1]\n   217→Right,\n   218→\n   219→[Speaker 2]\n   220→But then the the. I think that you do or the is specifically they have an algorithm that they use. That basically says okay, like. If I want to heat to this exact temperature, these are the valves and stuff that I should open. And we've ran this model against our like training software that our predicted our predictions software. In order to actually figure out like what the best way to do it is, and you were responsible for? Benchmarking, that to make sure that it actually was. Going to like their their model from improvements was actually going to work.\n   221→\n   222→[Speaker 1]\n   223→Um, so we were responsible for implementing and benchmarking. Okay, so we were to, essentially, under similar Fair conditions, train a controller. Which is just a model that sort of like figures out. What do to keep things in the optimal temperature range, while also using the least amount of energy?\n   224→\n   225→Um, essentially, we're training this controller over a similar data sets, you know, same same sort of data using two different algorithms. One was our client's proprietary. Differential Collective control algorithm, and the other was the field standard. Keep reinforcement learning, and the idea was that we were just. Essentially, do these trainings and then Benchmark across a variety of scenarios. The performance, right? So?\n   226→\n   227→[Speaker 2]\n   228→Yeah,\n   229→\n   230→[Speaker 1]\n   231→Uh, DPC. Differential predictive control is an additional element where? Instead of using, so we have the simulated system right for the, uh, that just gives the complete accurate temperatures of a rooms in a residential building as we sort of, you know, give different inputs to it. We call that white box, and it's one of our scenarios, but uh, we have another important scenario called Black Box where this is relevant specifically to differential predictive control. We train a neural network on the essential the phase, the state changes of the actual system to.\n   232→\n   233→Cause how that would cause the state to change, right? Like the temperature and the reason this is? Useful, I suppose, is because, uh, in actual buildings. So, if you were to generate this data in a real building, because there are some, like similar simulated buildings, but obviously every single residential building has a different design. Different mechanics in a different place, so we call those disturbances. Sometimes, you won't. You aren't actually able to physically crank up the heat, uh, and like, it's pretty costly to actually physically pull this lever and see what happens in the temperature, right? So you might only be able to do that a small amount of time and get a small data set, right? And you can't actually train a control algorithm in this kind of setting, because then you'd have to do the training with the live building. So, instead, the idea is that we make a machine learning model to sort of predict the outputs and then train a controller on that, and then we test the controller in the actual building to see how well it performs, so that's the.\n   234→\n   235→Areas where it might be kind of expensive to collect data you can't do training in real time because, you know, maybe these people in the building they want you cranking up the temperature, right,\n   236→\n   237→[Speaker 2]\n   238→Right?\n   239→\n   240→[Speaker 1]\n   241→So, you just click this update infinity. You create an emulator model, we call space, a state space model, and then you train your controllers on that and evaluate them on the real system so. Uh, that's sort of the setup. That's very\n   242→\n   243→[Speaker 2]\n   244→Cool. And so, what was the piece you needed to learn now that I understand it? Actually a little bit better,\n   245→\n   246→[Speaker 1]\n   247→Right? Uh, so the piece that I needed? Well, there was a lot, uh, to do with lending the library, but in in terms of? The question which I interpreted as sort of? When did you sort of lack domain expertise? It was in various functions. I realized that. Certain mistakes that I, I made, came from not a lack of understanding of machine learning, or, you know, software, the software and Frameworks, which I assumed initially that I was responsible for, but also just an understanding of how the HVAC sort of, uh. I guess the standard terminology in hraft works? And how that, how that translates to the libraries that we were using to? Um. Provide these building simulations, because yeah, uh, there were there. Were these, you know, various things like signals, controls, and we sort of what happened was oftentimes. In this project, we realized later on that, maybe a certain part of that library wasn't doing exactly what we thought it was doing. For example, like this normalization era that triggered, uh, the story that I was, uh?\n   248→\n   249→Because. We had we had unlimited access to the experts in HVAC, which which were our collaborators and? As a result, we sort of had limited knowledge of of the of HVAC and just the libraries that are associated with buildings and building temperatures. And that led to some again. That led to some errors that stemmed from, you know, not not realizing that. Uh, you know, certain functions you're doing certain things or certain signals were kind of like, not actually in the range that we expected.\n   250→\n   251→[Speaker 2]\n   252→I'm\n   253→\n   254→[Speaker 1]\n   255→Just thinking, if we, if I was able to, you know, really, maybe reach out independently to those collaborators or to, uh, somehow? Understand more about the the domain specific, like the the knowledge that's specific to? Buildings, then I could have, you know? Written this code to implement in Benchmark. These algorithms a lot. Better, I suppose. So, you were, you were an intern, right? Yeah, so did\n   256→\n   257→[Speaker 2]\n   258→They? What do new hires there do when they're trying to get on board into these systems? This is just kind of like a. There's no context learned by osmosis.\n   259→\n   260→[Speaker 1]\n   261→Um, yeah, so we have collaborators that are there. We have clients, and then we have collaborators and the collaborators are on our team, and they're meant to. They're Meant to help out with the domain knowledge, so these are. These, we're expected to come in with, you know, knowledge that's relevant to sort of Python and machine learning. Uh, that's sort of just the style of these. Internships. It's not like, we're joining a large project with a, with a large history. And, you know, senior sort of Engineers on that team. It's more like we're given a project that's, you know, a fairly? I guess small project by, you know, the standards of pnl probably? And we sort of meet it ourselves, and we've asked these collaborators for the knowledge that we, uh. Building knowledge. I'm not a building, they're not expecting anyone to be a buildings expert there. However, it seemed to us that during these collaborative meetings. It's just this just was too much information to really learn it. From directly from the collaborators, sort of like, there's so much domain knowledge so, uh? That sort of associated with that. A lot of times, we present art Direction, and then we'd get a course correction from these collaborators, because, oh, this domain doesn't actually care about that, or this domain knows that, you know, this certain thing is is, uh, not valuable. Yeah, so that's sort of the style, so we. It's a bit self-led, but also with help from these collaborators, and I was just. I was just thinking, I feel like\n   262→\n   263→[Speaker 2]\n   264→Most of the,\n   265→\n   266→[Speaker 1]\n   267→Uh.\n   268→\n   269→[Speaker 2]\n   270→The\n   271→\n   272→[Speaker 1]\n   273→Hiccups that came from that project actually came from a lack of domain knowledge, which maybe I could have, you know, sought out. That makes sense more independently, but because it's not really related to computer science, it was something that I initially avoided. Well, initially, I just I just took time with the collaboratories to understand my tasking, finish the tasking, but then there were later issues where they were identified based off of. Knowledge issues.\n   274→\n   275→[Speaker 2]\n   276→Nice. All, right. Well, let's move on here to the next question. Um. Can you describe a time when you needed to influence a peer? Who had a differing opinion about a shared goal.\n   277→\n   278→[Speaker 1]\n   279→I mean to be honest with you, you can say\n   280→\n   281→[Speaker 2]\n   282→No.\n   283→\n   284→[Speaker 1]\n   285→My best story for this is the uh,\n   286→\n   287→[Speaker 2]\n   288→Is the one\n   289→\n   290→[Speaker 1]\n   291→That I told about. Uh. That time that I, I sort of discovered inefficiency.\n   292→\n   293→[Speaker 2]\n   294→Oh, absolutely. Fine, you can know, is a perfectly acceptable answer,\n   295→\n   296→[Speaker 1]\n   297→Right? Um.\n   298→\n   299→[Speaker 2]\n   300→Rather, you actually be honest with me so that I can ask you a question where we can, you know, dive into some other detail. Um. Can you tell me about? Piece of tough or critical feedback that you've received.\n   301→\n   302→[Speaker 3]\n   303→But doesn't\n   304→\n   305→[Speaker 2]\n   306→Have to be. Um. Anything terribly serious, and it could just be like, you know, you? It could be anything from, like how you work together with people like you, maybe you, you know? Do you do you code in some way, people don't appreciate like it doesn't have to be like some big world ending, uh, piece of feedback. Yeah.\n   307→\n   308→[Speaker 1]\n   309→Thinking.\n   310→\n   311→[Speaker 3]\n   312→Um.\n   313→\n   314→Critical hearts feedback.\n   315→\n   316→[Speaker 1]\n   317→Um.\n   318→\n   319→So? During my time. On that project where I was benchmarking. Yeah, um. Machine learning algorithms. There was a there was a. When I I received like?\n   320→\n   321→Essentially. Me and my my co-worker, who was responsible for the DRL side of things, initially got some hiccups and getting along. Uh, because?\n   322→\n   323→[Speaker 3]\n   324→He.\n   325→\n   326→[Speaker 1]\n   327→A little critical of like? My sort of opinions on the way because I often. Oftentimes sort of. I'm a bit of an idealist like, I want things to be redone in a way. That's, uh, sort of. Well, I think would be best so. We had to find our protocol in such a way. Originally, the protocol that describes essentially the loss function and these things these are necessary for standardization between the two methods that we were benchmarking. Um, and when I initially joined the team, I was a bit, uh. I wanted. I kept sort of proposing the idea of rerunning, like rebuilding some of these systems. Because I thought that the protocol had some inefficiencies in it, and that made it hard to understand that, I thought, the uh, our customers would maybe not be too happy with. Uh, but my co-worker, I mean, so the Dr. The story here is that the DRL side is a bit older than the DPC side, so he had written already a lot of Legacy code, and I had I sort of, you know, was was starting fresh. So when I was implementing these changes, they would have been quite easy for me to implement. But on his side, it would have taken a lot of, uh, sort of. Effort there. And revision. So I was, I was, you know, pushing for these changes fairly constantly? And I received. Some critical critical feedback about sort of like? Essentially, just needing to focus down and just stick to. The deadlines and getting things done, which eventually, you know, I did. I did, uh, sort of. I didn't hear that. Um. So, for example. Originally in. Uh, client meetings up in team meetings. I would bring up, uh, just ways that we could alter our definition of a loss function to make it easier to understand and not include what I thought were sort of extraneous or pre-calculated normalization variables. I wanted to Define them smoothly in a way that would make sense and. I received. You know, quite a bit of pushback for that, but I believe that I was correct. So, I, I, I, I just pushed back in these meetings, but eventually, when my manager made the decision to just stick with the existing code because? Things were on there, uh, like, I guess we, like, I said, for this project, the type, the, the timelines were fairly tight, and we needed to deliver. Results basically every week. Uh, at that point, I just sort of. You know, put my head down. Stuck to the the plan, and I pushed out. We never ended up revising those sort of functions, uh, and we pushed back. We pushed out the result. Our clients were still satisfied with it, which is fine. I just thought it was, uh, it was an opportunity for. For a better product there.\n   328→\n   329→[Speaker 2]\n   330→Sure, I mean, what was the? Improvements to the customer outcome that you expected to get, right? Yeah, so? Um,\n   331→\n   332→[Speaker 1]\n   333→It's more of a, so the way that our loss function was defined, which was relevant for comparing these two metrics. These essentially, what we're saying is, whichever metric is better. Uh, whichever performs better on this metric. Is, we're claiming is the better algorithm right, and\n   334→\n   335→[Speaker 2]\n   336→The way\n   337→\n   338→[Speaker 1]\n   339→That these normalization. This last function was sort of computed, was it was computed using post normalization when using normalization constants that we had pre-computed from, essentially, a set of a sample of a certain number of task runs to get a range, right? So, these were like random decimals, uh?\n   340→\n   341→We briefly explained our process for generating them in the paper, but we would just set these points out and then. Just say, hey, these are. These are the constants, right? So I really thought that that. Made that sort of lack Clarity, and it took away from our claim that, hey, if it passes, if an algorithm performs better on this Benchmark on this, uh, sorry, optimization metric, it really is the better function, because if it's not like, you know, super clear to understand. I was, I felt that the people who our customers would be presenting our report to to convince them of, you know, the superiority or the? Use case. They would have trouble getting that by them because it wasn't very. Clear. Uh, so I, I was, I was, like, hey, on my code, uh, or like, I have this idea for simple fix? I'm sure it could be fixed on the other on the DRL side as well, and we can have like a, you know, a well-defined function that is defined in terms of non-normalized values, so we don't need all of these random terms. But yeah, I I just? Yeah, so I received sort of pushback and\n   342→\n   343→[Speaker 4]\n   344→Essentially pushing for.\n   345→\n   346→[Speaker 1]\n   347→It didn't take deadlines for it. Things that were not super in my in the eyes of my teammates, not super relevant.\n   348→\n   349→[Speaker 2]\n   350→That makes sense, and so. Dee, would you still push for them today?\n   351→\n   352→[Speaker 1]\n   353→Um. I would. Maybe I would push that would maybe just bring up the idea and under the understanding that everyone is sort of under tight deadlines. I think I would stop if. You know at the point that my teammate sort of clarified, uh, their situation, so why, uh, this wasn't a good idea? Yeah, did\n   354→\n   355→[Speaker 2]\n   356→You talk to the people that had to actually go and explain it to the customers?\n   357→\n   358→[Speaker 1]\n   359→Um, yeah, they sort of mentioned that. They would prefer. If that was? If that wasn't the case, I didn't. I I mentioned this at a time that was earlier on in the project again. Had limited access to these collaborators, so I wasn't asking them this question every single week, and that sort of where I both. I got for where I sort of cemented that idea that I ended up pushing for it a bit further. I'm not sure how exactly relevant it was for them, because at that point in Project, we weren't sort of splitting hairs between, uh. Which features we can. We can actually fit into our report, in which features we have to toss, which is sort of the situation we got in. Towards the end of the quarter.\n   360→\n   361→[Speaker 2]\n   362→Cool!\n   363→\n   364→[Speaker 1]\n   365→All, right. Well, I think.\n   366→\n   367→[Speaker 2]\n   368→That is all of my questions. Um, do you have any questions for me?\n   369→\n   370→[Speaker 1]\n   371→Oh yeah, so you said, I mean? You're a senior software engineer, right? You start as an sd1 at Amazon,\n   372→\n   373→[Speaker 2]\n   374→Started as an intern. Oh,\n   375→\n   376→[Speaker 1]\n   377→Did you move to some internet sd1 or directly?\n   378→\n   379→[Speaker 2]\n   380→Yeah, so you so the way the internships work is you intern over the summer and then you? You can come back after your. Uh, you know, year of college as an sd1?\n   381→\n   382→[Speaker 1]\n   383→Oh, I see. So, if you, if you've been in sd1, what do you think? Things that you want to like, what do? What are the things that successful sd1s do? Uh, to succeed in that role, and what are the pitfalls, uh, common pitfalls that people fall into in that rule, um?\n   384→\n   385→[Speaker 2]\n   386→So, what is? The job expectations of an sde one are are definitely the important thing to look at, right? So an sde one is, as I like to explain, it is basically just a full-time intern. Um, it's essentially where we bring in developers to give them a longer chance to prove that they can grow into productive. Engineers, and so being a productive engineer means multiple different things, does it? It means that you are able to complete your job with minimal oversight from others, right? So, we, we kind of expect, um. Nsd, you want to need a lot of guidance. But every ste one is judged based off of the ability to grow into an sde2, right, and so as an sd1, we expect you to be able to complete tasks that are well defined, but we also expect you to be able to. Figure out the gaps. Tasks that maybe aren't as well defined, right. Like, you need to be able to show that you have critical thinking skills throughout the entire software architecture chain to make sure that you can get you know. You can take ambiguous more and more ambiguous problems as you go and turn them into concrete Solutions. Additionally, it's a lot of. How much?\n   387→\n   388→Correction. Do you need right? So, a lot of SCU ones are. The writing code that's maybe not perfect. Maybe the writing code that's too perfect, but? Doesn't actually work for the business, right? Like, where, where are you actually prioritizing your time? Right is, is kind of very important, and then obviously just operational. Like, it's something that you're not really. Exposed to when you are a not in Industry, kind of the operations of maintaining large-scale systems that are currently operating, and so being on call and being able to handle yourself are very important.\n   389→\n   390→[Speaker 1]\n   391→Uh, and what about the pitfalls? So,\n   392→\n   393→[Speaker 2]\n   394→Explain what you mean by pitfalls of being an SD one.\n   395→\n   396→[Speaker 1]\n   397→What are common things that cause people to, uh, in an sd1 rule, not either, not progress to sd2 or just be leave the company?\n   398→\n   399→[Speaker 2]\n   400→Commonly, it is a failure to grow, um, things. I often see from sdu ones that, um, are not successful, is they do not under. They don't make the transition to understanding that, um. The work that you provide needs to be ambiguous, and you need to have high standards for ambiguous work, right? It's not necessarily that, okay, I need to get something done. It's, I need to get something done right. I don't need to be told what to do. I should understand what to do properly. A lot of it is,\n   401→\n   402→[Speaker 1]\n   403→Um.\n   404→\n   405→[Speaker 2]\n   406→Failure to grow to understand the changing requirements of software systems and that they serve the business, not necessarily. Um, being a code purist, right, like the end of the day, like we may or may not make changes based off of timelines and the things that we would need to get done in order to continue to make money. Um,\n   407→\n   408→[Speaker 3]\n   409→Yeah, and so it's\n   410→\n   411→[Speaker 2]\n   412→A lot of. Usually, it's a mental shift. The the coding bar to get into Amazon is fine, like, whatever, as long as you can code, I really don't care. It's the ability to understand and work with others, um. And know that the business is, you're here to serve the business. It's kind of the the major downfall I see from people.\n   413→\n   414→[Speaker 3]\n   415→Obviously, you have to\n   416→\n   417→[Speaker 2]\n   418→Be able to code, but like, if if you can't code, I can't fix that for you. Um, yeah, it's a\n   419→\n   420→[Speaker 1]\n   421→Lot\n   422→\n   423→[Speaker 2]\n   424→Of the soft skills that really prevent people from getting from one to two. If it's not just coding?\n   425→\n   426→[Speaker 1]\n   427→Um, yeah, I just had a question from your response. It was, uh, what do you mean by high standards for ambiguous code, like our ambiguous deliverables, um?\n   428→\n   429→[Speaker 2]\n   430→So, let's say I am building a piece of software. I need an API to do something. If you are building me an API that just does what I need it to do, but you don't consider the fact that it might grow in the future. Right, like, did you hard code in a bunch of stuff that gets it working now, but causes Tech debt in the future? Right, like, do you not understand the the wins the way the winds are blowing? So, like, can you look forward like three to six months to understand the code changes. We're gonna have to make then so that the stuff that you make now isn't going to. Give us downtime or outages or additional, you know? Development work that needs to be done in the future in order to undo some of the stuff you just did.\n   431→\n   432→Not\n   433→\n   434→[Speaker 3]\n   435→Sure?\n   436→\n   437→[Speaker 1]\n   438→Um. All right. Can I got one more question for you if you don't mind, uh? Is your favorite and least favorite part about the work culture at Amazon?\n   439→\n   440→[Speaker 2]\n   441→Favorite and least favorite. Amazon, the I think one of my favorite things about Amazon is it's kind of a. You can choose your own destiny. Kind of company. If you put in a lot of work and a lot of effort, you can see yourself, you know. Rise through the ranks. You can kind of find Opportunities. That you don't necessarily need to be given by your manager. You can go and talk to leaders to say this is something we should be doing. Make a case for it. And then, you know, make it happen. It is perfectly reasonable thing to happen here, which I don't think is often appreciated at other companies. Um, on the other side of that. Uh, one of my least favorite things about Amazon, it's. It's a large company, and so you have to deal with a lot of large company crap where you know there you have. You don't always have control, and your immediate leadership doesn't always have control over different parts of you know what your wife is like at Amazon, right? Like, we don't necessarily control RTO. So, like, we go back to the office five days a week, right? I'm sure everyone does that. Um, many people would prefer. We stayed at three three days a week, or we just were fully remote, but? Larger company. You don't really have access to some of the decision makers for those types of things. Right?\n   442→\n   443→[Speaker 1]\n   444→Gotcha. Overall,\n   445→\n   446→[Speaker 2]\n   447→I enjoy working here.\n   448→\n   449→[Speaker 1]\n   450→Oh, that's good to hear.\n   451→\n   452→[Speaker 2]\n   453→Supposed we have a bit of time remaining for? Like, I said, we, we don't have to take up the full amount of time this. This interview doesn't always take up the full hour. Yeah,\n   454→\n   455→[Speaker 1]\n   456→I mean, I guess I could ask you,\n   457→\n   458→[Speaker 2]\n   459→Yeah, one more thing. Well,\n   460→\n   461→[Speaker 1]\n   462→I'm just curious about, uh. So, when what was the last major failure that uh happened at, like either either something you were directly responsible for or just the team that you were on. And what sort of caused it and what could have prevented it? So? That.\n   463→\n   464→[Speaker 2]\n   465→An interesting question because my current team doesn't really own anything. Um, my team kind of writes recommendations and templates, and builds out libraries and software that's not actually running Production Services. And so. Have not really had serious outages for code that we owned, and it's, I've been on this team for like two years, so it's kind of. It's a semi-difficult question to answer. I've been on some very serious, um. Calls before, but? Um, I can't necessarily answer that. Oh yeah, yeah, I mean, that's true. All right. Yeah, I think, uh, I think those are all the questions I have for you. Cool. All, right? Well, hey, I think. You have a break after this. If I'm correct, I\n   466→\n   467→[Speaker 1]\n   468→Do so. Yeah, all right. Well, good luck in your next interview. Thank\n   469→\n   470→[Speaker 2]\n   471→You! Nice meeting! You hope to, uh, work together in the future all right, bye!\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious.

Hey Ben.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nHow you doing?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI'm doing well. How about you\n\n[Speaker 2]\nDoing great? You know, just getting into the swing of the day?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nYeah.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll right. Oh no, you're on the west coast as well. Yeah,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYep, out here in Seattle.\n\nHey, sorry,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nMy chime crashed there. I was just about to say, yeah, you're on the West Coast, right? You're in Seattle,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSure am. Yeah, chime is not my favorite piece of equipment.\n\nAll right, um, so sorry, what's where were we? Um. So? My name's Ben. It's nice to meet you. Um. The way this interview is kind of kind of go is we're going to do some quick introductions. Um, and then you and I are just going to kind of have a conversation for an hour, um, where I really kind of want to dig into some of the details of the stories that you're telling me. Um, and then I'll leave a little bit of time at the end for us to, you know, for you to ask me any questions. Um, we're not going to do any coding in in this interview. Okay. So, this interview might not last the full hour. I mean, that's perfectly okay.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nOkay, um?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCool, so why don't we started off, and uh, have you tell a little bit? Tell me a little about yourself.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, so I'm Harry. I'm a recent graduate from, uh? Lesson, Washington University with a bachelor's in computer science. Uh, I really do love programming. I do competitive programming as a hobby where I am ranked, uh, in the top 0.5 percent of 700, 000 roughly participants on leap code, so I have some strong tournament finishes, including, uh, finishing top 10.\n\nSay 10, 000 participants with multiple top 50 and top 100 finishes.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nEarly in my University experience I. Joined a machine learning research group where I initially worked on unpaid projects, just research projects. By my third year, my professor offered me an internship. Uh, opportunity, which I took and. At that time, I was able to work on a variety of tasks, including, you know, building machine learning pipelines. Writing documentation and even building web apps to deploy trained models. All of this was done in a collaborative environment where I worked closely with co-workers, managers, and clients, right?\n\nI also had a role like outside of academics at modest, where I built a end-to-end web application. Um. That supported features such as? Booking appointments, making purchases, you know, buying car parts? Uh, actually, processing the payments and also. Uh,\n\n[Speaker 3]\nLike\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHandling some internal business logic, like updating inventory spreadsheets. Do love the field of computer science. I love all the you know, fascinated by all the different problems in the field and the elegant Solutions that they require. I aspire to grow into roles where I can contribute to. The kinds of, and, you know, hopefully eventually lead the kinds of teams that are working on these projects in the real world in three columns. Yeah, that's, that's me.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCool all right, um? So, my name is Ben. Uh, I'm a senior software engineer here at. Asbx, specifically on the golden bath team. Um, I've been at Amazon for, like, eight years. I want to say. Um.\n\nAnd sorry. I people were yelling at me for some issue that's currently going on. Um, gosh, I'm trying to ignore it, um? So I've been named them for 8 years. I've been kind of all over the place I originally started off in Alexa, you know, eight years ago, when it was still cool, um, working on communication software over there. So, like, how do we actually route calls from, you know, device to device got a few patents over there? To primer, so it built a lot of the Drone delivery business software. A lot of the on the ground stuff. As well as some of the the vehicle interaction stuff. Um. From there, I ended up moving over into asbx, which is kind of like Builder tools. Where I've had multiple different things in my ownership. I've had operator tooling, so how do we actually enable operators to better? Uh, serve their services during an event in a safe manner. And then, more recently, uh, the golden path team, which is kind of responsible for dictating, not dictating, uh, recommending. Services should be architecting. How services should be architected and developed so that you have the best outcomes. For the general populace, as well as publishing things like caveats for. When do ignore recommendations when to use additional toolings, etc, etc? So, you know, things like these is the right thought throttling systems you need to use. These are the ways that you set up load balancing, etc, etc.\n\nAll right. So the way that this interview is, like, I said, gonna work because I'm just going to ask you a few questions, and we're just gonna have have a general conversation. Um, I'm gonna be taking notes over here. So, if you see me looking over here, typing that is. Perfectly fine. I'm still paying attention to you. All right, so. Let's start it off here. So, first of all? Uh, can you tell me about a time when you were trying to understand a complex system on your team? Oh, actually. Yeah, you are not an industry hire. Are you?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm, sorry. What is, does that mean I'm not hired? I'm a new grad. Yeah,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI\n\n[Speaker 1]\nDo have for my industry experience, uh, a story like that, yeah.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI I usually. So, when I prepare for interviews, I pull a question out, and then I, um, I just kind of ask it so I don't have to do any as much thinking. But since you are a new hire, this question is maybe a little bit harder for you to.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCome up with a good answer. So, let me pick a different one real quick.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll right,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm? Can you tell me about a problem you had to solve that required in-depth thought and Analysis?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm, yeah, so? When I was working. So, while during my time at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory? I worked on a project.\n\nUm, essentially. Emulate, but we were building machine learning models to emulate the outputs of Earth system models. Which? All right, incredibly slow and computationally expensive to run. So, at the time, we had a suite of Legacy research tools. Which were only accessible to a command line interface. At that point, I was tasked with building a web application to integrate these, uh, existing tools and make them accessible from a website. Um.\n\nDuring my my work to integrate the optimize tool. I noticed. Essentially.\n\nTool itself. When I called its API, it was very. It went extremely slowly, and I noticed this because I had set up a loading bar and a live graphing widget. To track the progress of the tool in real time. Uh, so. I noticed that for a sample batch of, say, 100 points, it took. Around three minutes to run, whereas I would have expected for that data size, uh, to maybe for it, maybe taking the range of 10 to 20 seconds around that scale, so? This prompted me to actually go ahead and look into the problem where I mean looking at the optimization function itself, where I found that. The code was like the the function was being implemented in a singular manner, such as the points were being processed, one by one rather than a batched manner, which was much faster and in my opinion standard. Uh, so because I didn't know who wrote the code, I brought this up at the next team meeting. My teammate, who had written the code, pushed back on me, saying that from his empirical tests, he found that, uh, the singular method yielded better results and was more accurate, he said. He believed that to be due to the fact that during optimization those points weren't interfering with each other. However, from my understanding of the code, and you know the functions that it calls specifically optimization using Adam W?\n\nActually, there was no interference. And because of that, the two methods should be computationally identical. I explained this, but my teammates and manager weren't fully convinced. So, at that point, I mentioned that I could write. A test that proved that the two were computationally identical. In addition, you know, my team asked for some. My teammates asked for some other things, like just a graphing feature, which. I,\n\n[Speaker 3]\nI\n\n[Speaker 1]\nMentioned, I would produce a graph of the results as well. So, my manager, thinking that this was, uh, worthwhile task, he basically.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAssign this to me for the next week. Uh, and then over the next two days. I sort of wrote this test, and also, you know. Built the graph, and I presented this at the next team meeting, so the test was essentially a test of equivalency. So, at each point in this iterative optimization process at each epic, it would compare the it would run through the same batch of starting points, uh.\n\nSingular and to a batch method, and then it would cast for equality and also graph that, and I presented the test of this manner to my team at the next team meeting, which was enough to convince everyone that the two were actually identical. As a result. We were able to switch from the slower singular method, the faster batched method which improved the user experience by, uh.\n\nOptimization for a batch of roughly. 200 points, roughly 100 points from. Three minutes to just under 20 seconds, which is a speed up of nearly 10x, so 100 is a fairly standard, uh, use case. Yeah, and I suppose. Yeah, that's the story. No,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThat mean, that makes sense. So.\n\nThat's interest.\n\nYou honestly did a really great job of explaining that, so I'm kind of at a loss for kind of figuring out follow-up questions here, um.\n\nWhat is your?\n\nSo, we'll in the end, what was the outcome they did? Did you? How did you like explain to your team more about this, like, did you create? Yeah, go ahead.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, um, I showed them the test, which was a I showed them the exact code.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhich was not super complicated. It was just, uh, you initialize this batch of points. You run the functions in parallel, so you step. At each step, you step it through the first function and then the second function, and you compare quality. And then, you also graph because they just requested this. You graph both points, and so we have a graph that you can track as well. And you know, at any point, the the two points are not within some really tiny margin of error, because you know, this floating Point error we're dealing with weights here? I think the error margin I set was one e to the negative eight somewhere in that range, so just completely. Tiny margin of error, so if it was not within that? It. Would the test would Mark it? And it. Notice, you know, there were no reports of, you know, for this exact instance, there were no reports of deviations from each other and the graphs were directly on top of each other and for a machine learning sort of like a training run. This is completely improbable to ever happen. If the two operations are not identical, right? So, this test? Essentially proved definitively that the two were computationally identical, and when my teammates saw this, they saw the graph they saw the code. It was enough to convince them\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCool. I'm not terribly familiar with machine learning. Quite Frank with you, which is not a problem, the I guess what I'm curious about is? Was there? You were able to convince this one teammate that, um, you know this, this other way was, you know, computationally equivalent, um? What was the customer benefit of? Actually, yeah, go ahead.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, sorry. Um, the customer benefit is that I am designing this, uh? The designing in building this web application for customer use, right? Because the idea of the web application, uh, is it's it's for it's for internal use, but it's also it's mainly for, uh, the use of our customers who maybe aren't that, technically, uh. With, you know, python, or these interfaces, and for them to be able to access our tools through a web application rather than the command line application. It's just a great ease of use for them, and they also don't have to read any documentation or any of that stuff so. When they? You know, train a sample of a hundred points here, like, optimize a sample of 100 points. They would have to wait three minutes for that optimization to finish. After this Improvement, they would only need to wait, uh, 20 seconds to get the same level of accuracy. So, that's nearly a 10x speed up. General use case, oftentimes the way that. Uh, basically, the flow of this operation tool is you set your scenarios. You fix your inputs, and then you might want to try like a bunch of different kinds of scenarios, so you might take the same or different batch of 100 points, and you want to run it through a bunch of different scenarios in all in the same setting, right? So, if the optimization run takes only 20 seconds. You can accomplish that a lot quicker. That's, that's the benefit to the customer.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNo, that makes a lot of sense. It makes a lot of sense, so.\n\nIs there anything you would have done differently, or were there other places that you could have applied this learning?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm.\n\nUm, in this in this particular story.\n\nI believe I handled it quite. Well, I mean, it's kind of part of why I kicked it as a story to tell, but? I, um, in some of. You know, in my earlier sort of like? Uh, when I was just onboarding onto this project. Uh, I one thing. That I could have sort of learned more about, like, I could have read the internals of the code a bit more deeply before I began interfacing with the tools because I think that that would have prevented some other like hiccups in the future. What I did. Was I sort of learned the uh interface, but I really just learned them as interfaces. I didn't bother to break open their implementation, uh? If I'd done that, I would have had actually more familiarity with the behavior of these interfaces, a lot of which they were documented. But maybe they weren't documented that well, and if I had taken that extra step to, you know, dive just a little bit deeper than I could have, uh, I could have saved myself some time. Yeah, I think the\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI mean, it's always interesting because these are. Having success stories are really, in my mind, a opportunity to understand where you need to grow and realize that you have done some growing. Um, so knowing knowing that, like, do you think you'd be better prepared to handle a similar scenario in the future?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOh, um.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThinking,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh, I'm thinking about essentially. Where, like, because a few things is one, the reason that I didn't. I had to bring up the, uh, this problem in the team meeting was because I didn't know who had written the code,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nRight? Uh, so I, I\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWas, I was unable to sort of, like, have a one-on-one with them. I'm not sure if that caused the person to become a little, uh, like, I don't know, defensive. Yeah, defensive, uh? Because originally, when I was when I brought it up, they were convinced that Dakota had written for the batch implementation was wrong. Uh, and. I'm not. I'm not sure if that came out of a place of defense in this, or just, you know, General General curiosity. Maybe I could have approached it a bit better by, uh, getting to really. Like, I said, if I had come to understand the internals. Maybe I would have also known who who was responsible for building them, you know who, who would just sort of ask? Each of those things, and if I'd resolved that individually, maybe I could have gotten away with not even writing the test, right? Then again, having that test there is like, it's everyone is, is like with that test there. Everyone is quite sort of confident with removing this old functionality. Absolutely. The\n\n[Speaker 2]\nTest isn't necessarily a bad thing. Yeah, I do think that there is. It does make sense that maybe there's a way a learning about how to work with, um? Even if not this person. But like, you know, you're gonna have to work with tons of different types of people, right?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, yeah.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAnyway, just a thought, all right, so? Let's go ahead and move on to to another story. Um. Can you tell me about a time? When you realize you needed a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job well.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWho let me think on that for a bit.\n\nDeeper level of subject matter expertise? Yeah, I mean so. When I was working at is another one of my internships at Pacific Northwest, National Laboratory was a different project. I was working on a project.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nWe.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nEssentially. Benchmarking two machine learning algorithms. Uh, against each other, uh. And these machine learning algorithms were basically doing. Uh, modeling and control of temperatures within residential buildings. So, I was responsible for our clients proprietary algorithm, which was differential. Differential predictive control, right? So roughly two weeks before, uh, we had to deliver our end of quarter deadline and mine. Keep in mind this project, it was a project that was really sort of. Always had tight deadlines because our clients were quite pushy with the amount of features that they wanted done. And you know, the dates that they wanted them shipped by. So, it was always rather.\n\nSorry, rather type deadlines on that project. So, roughly two weeks before the end of quarter deadline, um? I was peer programming with my teammate, who was responsible for the Deep reinforcement learning side of things, which is the other algorithm that was being benchmarked, and we were working where Pew programming together, because we were working on integration tests. Between our two modules. So during that session. I noticed. Uh, just what, what? Walk me over, uh? Part in his code again. One of the normalization, like there was a place where the code was normalizing. To a range that was slightly outside of our defined protocol. Uh, we realized that it didn't. Show up in our tests because this is something that happened in the middle of the pipeline. So, the the end pipeline sort of results still fell into the expected range of our tests so? I sort of. I pointed out the problem. Him and we, we discussed it. We verified that it actually was an error. We, uh, we fixed it. But we also considered because it wasn't a simple fix because this had. Uh, a lot of implications for our tests that have already been run right, so invalidated a lot of our previous. Test results. Uh, so realizing this, we immediately notified our manager who set up a team meeting where we sort of, you know, explained the issue. And what we believed were all the implications and the benchmarks that needed to be redone as a result.\n\nOur manager, you know? Seeing this, he reassigned our priorities, and he asked me to work with my teammate on resolving this issue before resuming any of our other tasking because these were essentially our core deliverables, and we were quite short on time at that point, uh, so. I collaborated with my teammate to fix the air, and but also to put in more, uh, reliable tests. Uh, so that similar cases would not, uh, happen again in the future. And then we also re-ran the experiment that were affected by this. Uh, air. And.\n\nAs a result, we were able to deliver our. Deliverables, which is, which is that end of quarter report? Uh, on time, although you know I had to work a little bit of overtime and? My manager talked to our clients and got them to sort of push back some extra features to the next quarter. And when we delivered that report, they were satisfied with the results. So? The reason that that is a story about, you know? More domain expertise because it's because the normalization it was specifically related to.\n\nUh. Some residential Building like HVAC knowledge, which uh our collaborators were mainly responsible. I guess you could do some quotes responsible, uh, for providing the domain knowledge on that part, but I found that as someone who was, you know, responsible for the implementation? Uh, lacking a full understanding of those details often led to either. Similar issues like this in my code. Or just an inability to spot these immediately in other people's code so? Yeah, that was. That was an like, I believe that if I had taken that time to, uh, sort of. They not only just into, you know, the machine learning side of things, but also try to really understand, you know, uh, the domain knowledge in those residential buildings. I could have caught this issue. Uh, sooner wrote better tests, you know to, to identify possible issues sooner. Uh, and just generally had a smoother time building this price project. Yeah. Okay.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI'm going to repeat it back. You just to make sure I understand exactly the story, so you, you have a machine learning algorithm that you needed to Benchmark as a part of it was for the research laboratory, which did building temperatures. I'm not really sure I\n\n[Speaker 1]\nGot that part. Um, so the Lisa's lab toys, specifically, it's a large place. Um, the team specifically was a neuromancer team, and they were. They were developing this new sort of control algorithm because the field standard at the time was deep reinforcement learning, right?\n\nAlgorithm called differential predictive control, which they believe could perform better in these residential buildings. So, we were tasked with benchmarking, though, so essentially, under similar conditions, similar data set sizes and training. Compute allowances. To compare comparing the performances of these two algorithms is the\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIdea. So, so is the idea that, like, you have a predictive algorithm that runs on? Heaters to figure out when to turn on and off.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, so there were physical like, uh, depending on the system. They're like, essentially, physical things like valves levers. These are. These are some books that are adjusted by control. This is a two-part process. It's modeling and control, so the first part was to train something called a state space model to essentially predict what a certain the effect that a certain action would have on an environment like, say, the temperature. Like, if I perform this action, I tweak this vowel. I expect that in the next time slot. That the, uh, the room will be at this higher temperature, right? So? So that is trade on. Oh,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOh, so I'm just trying to make sure I understand. So, it actually sounds kind of interesting. So, like the HVAC system itself they have, I assume some random Swedish software. You can configure the building and all the valves and stuff, and then it has. Anything else you can kind of mess or like an aircraft simulator, right? You can kind of figure out what's going to happen based off of the inputs you give it right. Standard control Theory stuff?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nBut then the the. I think that you do or the is specifically they have an algorithm that they use. That basically says okay, like. If I want to heat to this exact temperature, these are the valves and stuff that I should open. And we've ran this model against our like training software that our predicted our predictions software. In order to actually figure out like what the best way to do it is, and you were responsible for? Benchmarking, that to make sure that it actually was. Going to like their their model from improvements was actually going to work.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm, so we were responsible for implementing and benchmarking. Okay, so we were to, essentially, under similar Fair conditions, train a controller. Which is just a model that sort of like figures out. What do to keep things in the optimal temperature range, while also using the least amount of energy?\n\nUm, essentially, we're training this controller over a similar data sets, you know, same same sort of data using two different algorithms. One was our client's proprietary. Differential Collective control algorithm, and the other was the field standard. Keep reinforcement learning, and the idea was that we were just. Essentially, do these trainings and then Benchmark across a variety of scenarios. The performance, right? So?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh, DPC. Differential predictive control is an additional element where? Instead of using, so we have the simulated system right for the, uh, that just gives the complete accurate temperatures of a rooms in a residential building as we sort of, you know, give different inputs to it. We call that white box, and it's one of our scenarios, but uh, we have another important scenario called Black Box where this is relevant specifically to differential predictive control. We train a neural network on the essential the phase, the state changes of the actual system to.\n\nCause how that would cause the state to change, right? Like the temperature and the reason this is? Useful, I suppose, is because, uh, in actual buildings. So, if you were to generate this data in a real building, because there are some, like similar simulated buildings, but obviously every single residential building has a different design. Different mechanics in a different place, so we call those disturbances. Sometimes, you won't. You aren't actually able to physically crank up the heat, uh, and like, it's pretty costly to actually physically pull this lever and see what happens in the temperature, right? So you might only be able to do that a small amount of time and get a small data set, right? And you can't actually train a control algorithm in this kind of setting, because then you'd have to do the training with the live building. So, instead, the idea is that we make a machine learning model to sort of predict the outputs and then train a controller on that, and then we test the controller in the actual building to see how well it performs, so that's the.\n\nAreas where it might be kind of expensive to collect data you can't do training in real time because, you know, maybe these people in the building they want you cranking up the temperature, right,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nRight?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, you just click this update infinity. You create an emulator model, we call space, a state space model, and then you train your controllers on that and evaluate them on the real system so. Uh, that's sort of the setup. That's very\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCool. And so, what was the piece you needed to learn now that I understand it? Actually a little bit better,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight? Uh, so the piece that I needed? Well, there was a lot, uh, to do with lending the library, but in in terms of? The question which I interpreted as sort of? When did you sort of lack domain expertise? It was in various functions. I realized that. Certain mistakes that I, I made, came from not a lack of understanding of machine learning, or, you know, software, the software and Frameworks, which I assumed initially that I was responsible for, but also just an understanding of how the HVAC sort of, uh. I guess the standard terminology in hraft works? And how that, how that translates to the libraries that we were using to? Um. Provide these building simulations, because yeah, uh, there were there. Were these, you know, various things like signals, controls, and we sort of what happened was oftentimes. In this project, we realized later on that, maybe a certain part of that library wasn't doing exactly what we thought it was doing. For example, like this normalization era that triggered, uh, the story that I was, uh?\n\nBecause. We had we had unlimited access to the experts in HVAC, which which were our collaborators and? As a result, we sort of had limited knowledge of of the of HVAC and just the libraries that are associated with buildings and building temperatures. And that led to some again. That led to some errors that stemmed from, you know, not not realizing that. Uh, you know, certain functions you're doing certain things or certain signals were kind of like, not actually in the range that we expected.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI'm\n\n[Speaker 1]\nJust thinking, if we, if I was able to, you know, really, maybe reach out independently to those collaborators or to, uh, somehow? Understand more about the the domain specific, like the the knowledge that's specific to? Buildings, then I could have, you know? Written this code to implement in Benchmark. These algorithms a lot. Better, I suppose. So, you were, you were an intern, right? Yeah, so did\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThey? What do new hires there do when they're trying to get on board into these systems? This is just kind of like a. There's no context learned by osmosis.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm, yeah, so we have collaborators that are there. We have clients, and then we have collaborators and the collaborators are on our team, and they're meant to. They're Meant to help out with the domain knowledge, so these are. These, we're expected to come in with, you know, knowledge that's relevant to sort of Python and machine learning. Uh, that's sort of just the style of these. Internships. It's not like, we're joining a large project with a, with a large history. And, you know, senior sort of Engineers on that team. It's more like we're given a project that's, you know, a fairly? I guess small project by, you know, the standards of pnl probably? And we sort of meet it ourselves, and we've asked these collaborators for the knowledge that we, uh. Building knowledge. I'm not a building, they're not expecting anyone to be a buildings expert there. However, it seemed to us that during these collaborative meetings. It's just this just was too much information to really learn it. From directly from the collaborators, sort of like, there's so much domain knowledge so, uh? That sort of associated with that. A lot of times, we present art Direction, and then we'd get a course correction from these collaborators, because, oh, this domain doesn't actually care about that, or this domain knows that, you know, this certain thing is is, uh, not valuable. Yeah, so that's sort of the style, so we. It's a bit self-led, but also with help from these collaborators, and I was just. I was just thinking, I feel like\n\n[Speaker 2]\nMost of the,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThe\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHiccups that came from that project actually came from a lack of domain knowledge, which maybe I could have, you know, sought out. That makes sense more independently, but because it's not really related to computer science, it was something that I initially avoided. Well, initially, I just I just took time with the collaboratories to understand my tasking, finish the tasking, but then there were later issues where they were identified based off of. Knowledge issues.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNice. All, right. Well, let's move on here to the next question. Um. Can you describe a time when you needed to influence a peer? Who had a differing opinion about a shared goal.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI mean to be honest with you, you can say\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNo.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nMy best story for this is the uh,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIs the one\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThat I told about. Uh. That time that I, I sort of discovered inefficiency.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOh, absolutely. Fine, you can know, is a perfectly acceptable answer,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight? Um.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nRather, you actually be honest with me so that I can ask you a question where we can, you know, dive into some other detail. Um. Can you tell me about? Piece of tough or critical feedback that you've received.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nBut doesn't\n\n[Speaker 2]\nHave to be. Um. Anything terribly serious, and it could just be like, you know, you? It could be anything from, like how you work together with people like you, maybe you, you know? Do you do you code in some way, people don't appreciate like it doesn't have to be like some big world ending, uh, piece of feedback. Yeah.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThinking.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUm.\n\nCritical hearts feedback.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm.\n\nSo? During my time. On that project where I was benchmarking. Yeah, um. Machine learning algorithms. There was a there was a. When I I received like?\n\nEssentially. Me and my my co-worker, who was responsible for the DRL side of things, initially got some hiccups and getting along. Uh, because?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nHe.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nA little critical of like? My sort of opinions on the way because I often. Oftentimes sort of. I'm a bit of an idealist like, I want things to be redone in a way. That's, uh, sort of. Well, I think would be best so. We had to find our protocol in such a way. Originally, the protocol that describes essentially the loss function and these things these are necessary for standardization between the two methods that we were benchmarking. Um, and when I initially joined the team, I was a bit, uh. I wanted. I kept sort of proposing the idea of rerunning, like rebuilding some of these systems. Because I thought that the protocol had some inefficiencies in it, and that made it hard to understand that, I thought, the uh, our customers would maybe not be too happy with. Uh, but my co-worker, I mean, so the Dr. The story here is that the DRL side is a bit older than the DPC side, so he had written already a lot of Legacy code, and I had I sort of, you know, was was starting fresh. So when I was implementing these changes, they would have been quite easy for me to implement. But on his side, it would have taken a lot of, uh, sort of. Effort there. And revision. So I was, I was, you know, pushing for these changes fairly constantly? And I received. Some critical critical feedback about sort of like? Essentially, just needing to focus down and just stick to. The deadlines and getting things done, which eventually, you know, I did. I did, uh, sort of. I didn't hear that. Um. So, for example. Originally in. Uh, client meetings up in team meetings. I would bring up, uh, just ways that we could alter our definition of a loss function to make it easier to understand and not include what I thought were sort of extraneous or pre-calculated normalization variables. I wanted to Define them smoothly in a way that would make sense and. I received. You know, quite a bit of pushback for that, but I believe that I was correct. So, I, I, I, I just pushed back in these meetings, but eventually, when my manager made the decision to just stick with the existing code because? Things were on there, uh, like, I guess we, like, I said, for this project, the type, the, the timelines were fairly tight, and we needed to deliver. Results basically every week. Uh, at that point, I just sort of. You know, put my head down. Stuck to the the plan, and I pushed out. We never ended up revising those sort of functions, uh, and we pushed back. We pushed out the result. Our clients were still satisfied with it, which is fine. I just thought it was, uh, it was an opportunity for. For a better product there.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSure, I mean, what was the? Improvements to the customer outcome that you expected to get, right? Yeah, so? Um,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nIt's more of a, so the way that our loss function was defined, which was relevant for comparing these two metrics. These essentially, what we're saying is, whichever metric is better. Uh, whichever performs better on this metric. Is, we're claiming is the better algorithm right, and\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThe way\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThat these normalization. This last function was sort of computed, was it was computed using post normalization when using normalization constants that we had pre-computed from, essentially, a set of a sample of a certain number of task runs to get a range, right? So, these were like random decimals, uh?\n\nWe briefly explained our process for generating them in the paper, but we would just set these points out and then. Just say, hey, these are. These are the constants, right? So I really thought that that. Made that sort of lack Clarity, and it took away from our claim that, hey, if it passes, if an algorithm performs better on this Benchmark on this, uh, sorry, optimization metric, it really is the better function, because if it's not like, you know, super clear to understand. I was, I felt that the people who our customers would be presenting our report to to convince them of, you know, the superiority or the? Use case. They would have trouble getting that by them because it wasn't very. Clear. Uh, so I, I was, I was, like, hey, on my code, uh, or like, I have this idea for simple fix? I'm sure it could be fixed on the other on the DRL side as well, and we can have like a, you know, a well-defined function that is defined in terms of non-normalized values, so we don't need all of these random terms. But yeah, I I just? Yeah, so I received sort of pushback and\n\n[Speaker 4]\nEssentially pushing for.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nIt didn't take deadlines for it. Things that were not super in my in the eyes of my teammates, not super relevant.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThat makes sense, and so. Dee, would you still push for them today?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm. I would. Maybe I would push that would maybe just bring up the idea and under the understanding that everyone is sort of under tight deadlines. I think I would stop if. You know at the point that my teammate sort of clarified, uh, their situation, so why, uh, this wasn't a good idea? Yeah, did\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYou talk to the people that had to actually go and explain it to the customers?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm, yeah, they sort of mentioned that. They would prefer. If that was? If that wasn't the case, I didn't. I I mentioned this at a time that was earlier on in the project again. Had limited access to these collaborators, so I wasn't asking them this question every single week, and that sort of where I both. I got for where I sort of cemented that idea that I ended up pushing for it a bit further. I'm not sure how exactly relevant it was for them, because at that point in Project, we weren't sort of splitting hairs between, uh. Which features we can. We can actually fit into our report, in which features we have to toss, which is sort of the situation we got in. Towards the end of the quarter.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCool!\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll, right. Well, I think.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThat is all of my questions. Um, do you have any questions for me?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOh yeah, so you said, I mean? You're a senior software engineer, right? You start as an sd1 at Amazon,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nStarted as an intern. Oh,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nDid you move to some internet sd1 or directly?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, so you so the way the internships work is you intern over the summer and then you? You can come back after your. Uh, you know, year of college as an sd1?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOh, I see. So, if you, if you've been in sd1, what do you think? Things that you want to like, what do? What are the things that successful sd1s do? Uh, to succeed in that role, and what are the pitfalls, uh, common pitfalls that people fall into in that rule, um?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, what is? The job expectations of an sde one are are definitely the important thing to look at, right? So an sde one is, as I like to explain, it is basically just a full-time intern. Um, it's essentially where we bring in developers to give them a longer chance to prove that they can grow into productive. Engineers, and so being a productive engineer means multiple different things, does it? It means that you are able to complete your job with minimal oversight from others, right? So, we, we kind of expect, um. Nsd, you want to need a lot of guidance. But every ste one is judged based off of the ability to grow into an sde2, right, and so as an sd1, we expect you to be able to complete tasks that are well defined, but we also expect you to be able to. Figure out the gaps. Tasks that maybe aren't as well defined, right. Like, you need to be able to show that you have critical thinking skills throughout the entire software architecture chain to make sure that you can get you know. You can take ambiguous more and more ambiguous problems as you go and turn them into concrete Solutions. Additionally, it's a lot of. How much?\n\nCorrection. Do you need right? So, a lot of SCU ones are. The writing code that's maybe not perfect. Maybe the writing code that's too perfect, but? Doesn't actually work for the business, right? Like, where, where are you actually prioritizing your time? Right is, is kind of very important, and then obviously just operational. Like, it's something that you're not really. Exposed to when you are a not in Industry, kind of the operations of maintaining large-scale systems that are currently operating, and so being on call and being able to handle yourself are very important.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh, and what about the pitfalls? So,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nExplain what you mean by pitfalls of being an SD one.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhat are common things that cause people to, uh, in an sd1 rule, not either, not progress to sd2 or just be leave the company?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCommonly, it is a failure to grow, um, things. I often see from sdu ones that, um, are not successful, is they do not under. They don't make the transition to understanding that, um. The work that you provide needs to be ambiguous, and you need to have high standards for ambiguous work, right? It's not necessarily that, okay, I need to get something done. It's, I need to get something done right. I don't need to be told what to do. I should understand what to do properly. A lot of it is,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nFailure to grow to understand the changing requirements of software systems and that they serve the business, not necessarily. Um, being a code purist, right, like the end of the day, like we may or may not make changes based off of timelines and the things that we would need to get done in order to continue to make money. Um,\n\n[Speaker 3]\nYeah, and so it's\n\n[Speaker 2]\nA lot of. Usually, it's a mental shift. The the coding bar to get into Amazon is fine, like, whatever, as long as you can code, I really don't care. It's the ability to understand and work with others, um. And know that the business is, you're here to serve the business. It's kind of the the major downfall I see from people.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nObviously, you have to\n\n[Speaker 2]\nBe able to code, but like, if if you can't code, I can't fix that for you. Um, yeah, it's a\n\n[Speaker 1]\nLot\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOf the soft skills that really prevent people from getting from one to two. If it's not just coding?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm, yeah, I just had a question from your response. It was, uh, what do you mean by high standards for ambiguous code, like our ambiguous deliverables, um?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, let's say I am building a piece of software. I need an API to do something. If you are building me an API that just does what I need it to do, but you don't consider the fact that it might grow in the future. Right, like, did you hard code in a bunch of stuff that gets it working now, but causes Tech debt in the future? Right, like, do you not understand the the wins the way the winds are blowing? So, like, can you look forward like three to six months to understand the code changes. We're gonna have to make then so that the stuff that you make now isn't going to. Give us downtime or outages or additional, you know? Development work that needs to be done in the future in order to undo some of the stuff you just did.\n\nNot\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSure?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm. All right. Can I got one more question for you if you don't mind, uh? Is your favorite and least favorite part about the work culture at Amazon?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nFavorite and least favorite. Amazon, the I think one of my favorite things about Amazon is it's kind of a. You can choose your own destiny. Kind of company. If you put in a lot of work and a lot of effort, you can see yourself, you know. Rise through the ranks. You can kind of find Opportunities. That you don't necessarily need to be given by your manager. You can go and talk to leaders to say this is something we should be doing. Make a case for it. And then, you know, make it happen. It is perfectly reasonable thing to happen here, which I don't think is often appreciated at other companies. Um, on the other side of that. Uh, one of my least favorite things about Amazon, it's. It's a large company, and so you have to deal with a lot of large company crap where you know there you have. You don't always have control, and your immediate leadership doesn't always have control over different parts of you know what your wife is like at Amazon, right? Like, we don't necessarily control RTO. So, like, we go back to the office five days a week, right? I'm sure everyone does that. Um, many people would prefer. We stayed at three three days a week, or we just were fully remote, but? Larger company. You don't really have access to some of the decision makers for those types of things. Right?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nGotcha. Overall,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI enjoy working here.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOh, that's good to hear.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSupposed we have a bit of time remaining for? Like, I said, we, we don't have to take up the full amount of time this. This interview doesn't always take up the full hour. Yeah,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI mean, I guess I could ask you,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, one more thing. Well,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI'm just curious about, uh. So, when what was the last major failure that uh happened at, like either either something you were directly responsible for or just the team that you were on. And what sort of caused it and what could have prevented it? So? That.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAn interesting question because my current team doesn't really own anything. Um, my team kind of writes recommendations and templates, and builds out libraries and software that's not actually running Production Services. And so. Have not really had serious outages for code that we owned, and it's, I've been on this team for like two years, so it's kind of. It's a semi-difficult question to answer. I've been on some very serious, um. Calls before, but? Um, I can't necessarily answer that. Oh yeah, yeah, I mean, that's true. All right. Yeah, I think, uh, I think those are all the questions I have for you. Cool. All, right? Well, hey, I think. You have a break after this. If I'm correct, I\n\n[Speaker 1]\nDo so. Yeah, all right. Well, good luck in your next interview. Thank\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYou! Nice meeting! You hope to, uh, work together in the future all right, bye!","numLines":471,"startLine":1,"totalLines":471}}}

Harry exhibits solid problem-solving skills and technical depth, particularly in machine learning and optimization, but needs development in collaborative decision-making and accepting business constraints. While showing some learning behaviors, the candidate's resistance to feedback and tendency to push personal preferences over team decisions raises concerns about cultural fit and coachability.\n\n## Overall Assessment\n**Rating: 2 - Inclined Not to Hire**\n\nThe candidate shows technical competence but exhibits concerning behavioral patterns that suggest challenges with Amazon's collaborative culture and high-velocity environment.\n\n## Earns Trust\n\nThe candidate shows mixed performance in earning trust, with some positive examples of transparency but concerning patterns of persistent pushback and resistance to team decisions. Harry demonstrated honesty by bringing forward the optimization issue in a team meeting (lines 95-96) but also showed a pattern of continuing to advocate for changes despite team pushback and tight deadlines. The candidate's approach to influencing peers appears to lack sensitivity to team dynamics and business constraints, as evidenced by the continued pushing for protocol changes despite clear feedback about priorities and timeline constraints (lines 327-347).\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Transparent about discovering and reporting the optimization performance issue to the team\n- (+) Honest about limitations and areas for improvement when reflecting on past experiences\n- (+) Took responsibility for needing to develop better domain expertise in HVAC systems\n- (+) Acknowledged the defensive reaction from teammate and reflected on better approaches\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Continued pushing for changes despite clear feedback from teammates about priorities and deadlines\n- (-) Did not demonstrate sensitivity to the impact of proposed changes on teammate's existing work\n- (-) Failed to accept team decisions and continued advocating for personal preferences\n- (-) Showed pattern of idealistic thinking over practical business considerations\n\n## Learn and Be Curious\n\nThe candidate demonstrates strong curiosity and learning behaviors in technical domains, actively seeking to understand complex systems and improve performance through deep analysis. Harry showed excellent learning agility when discovering the optimization inefficiency, conducting thorough investigation and creating comprehensive tests to validate findings (lines 109-114). However, the candidate's learning appears primarily focused on technical aspects, with less evidence of learning from interpersonal feedback or adapting collaborative approaches based on team dynamics and business requirements.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Proactively investigated performance issues and dug into code implementation details\n- (+) Created comprehensive tests to validate assumptions and prove computational equivalence\n- (+) Recognized the need for deeper domain expertise in HVAC systems for better code implementation\n- (+) Competitive programming background showing continuous technical skill development\n- (+) Self-directed learning in machine learning research environments\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Limited evidence of learning from interpersonal feedback or team dynamics\n- (-) Did not demonstrate adaptation of approach after receiving pushback from colleagues\n- (-) Focused learning primarily on technical domains rather than collaborative skills\n- (-) Missed opportunities to learn from business constraints and priority management\n\n## Dive Deep\n\nThe candidate exhibits exceptional technical depth and analytical rigor when investigating complex problems, as demonstrated by the thorough analysis of the optimization performance issue. Harry conducted detailed investigation of the code implementation, understood the underlying AdamW optimization algorithm, and created comprehensive equivalency tests with precise error margins (lines 127-133). The candidate also showed deep technical understanding across multiple domains including machine learning, HVAC systems integration, and performance optimization, demonstrating ability to work across complex technical stacks.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Conducted thorough technical investigation of optimization performance bottleneck\n- (+) Deep understanding of machine learning algorithms and their computational properties\n- (+) Created rigorous testing methodology with appropriate error tolerances for floating-point operations\n- (+) Demonstrated technical depth across multiple domains (ML, web development, system integration)\n- (+) Strong analytical skills in identifying root causes of performance issues\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Deep technical focus sometimes came at expense of understanding team priorities\n- (-) Did not dive deep into understanding team dynamics or business constraints\n- (-) Technical perfectionism may have hindered practical delivery timelines\n- (-) Limited evidence of diving deep into customer impact vs. technical elegance trade-offs\n\n## Technical Assessment\n\nThe candidate demonstrates strong technical competency with impressive competitive programming achievements and hands-on experience across multiple technology stacks. Harry showed excellent problem-solving skills in identifying and resolving the optimization performance issue, demonstrating both analytical thinking and implementation skills. The candidate's technical background spans machine learning, web development, and system integration, with practical experience in collaborative development environments including research labs and industry internships.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Top 0.5% ranking in competitive programming with 700,000+ participants\n- (+) Practical experience across ML, web development, and system integration\n- (+) Strong debugging and performance optimization skills\n- (+) Experience with collaborative development in research and industry settings\n- (+) Solid understanding of testing methodologies and validation approaches\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Technical perfectionism may impede practical delivery in business environments\n- (-) Limited experience with large-scale production systems and operational concerns\n- (-) Focus on technical elegance over business value and timeline considerations\n- (-) Inexperience with industry-standard practices for handling technical debt and trade-offs\n\n## Communication & Interpersonal Skills\n\nThe candidate demonstrates clear technical communication skills and ability to explain complex concepts effectively, as evidenced by the detailed explanation of the machine learning benchmarking project. Harry showed ability to present findings to team meetings and create visual demonstrations (graphs) to support technical arguments (lines 127-133). However, the candidate exhibited concerning patterns in handling disagreement and pushback, continuing to advocate for changes despite clear feedback about priorities and showing limited sensitivity to team dynamics and collaborative decision-making processes.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Clear and detailed explanation of complex technical concepts during the interview\n- (+) Ability to present technical findings effectively to team meetings\n- (+) Used visual aids (graphs) to support technical arguments and demonstrate equivalency\n- (+) Collaborative experience in research environments with multiple stakeholders\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Persistent advocacy for personal preferences despite team pushback and business constraints\n- (-) Limited demonstrated sensitivity to team dynamics and collaborative decision-making\n- (-) Pattern of prioritizing technical idealism over practical team considerations\n- (-) Insufficient adaptation of communication approach based on audience and context\n\n## Red Flags\n\n- Continued pushing for changes despite explicit feedback about priorities and deadlines\n- Pattern of resistance to team decisions and business constraints\n- Limited evidence of learning from interpersonal feedback\n- Tendency to prioritize technical perfection over practical delivery\n- Concerning pattern of not accepting \"no\" as an answer from teammates and management\n- Potential cultural fit issues with Amazon's customer-obsessed and ownership principles\n\n## Recommendation Summary\n\nWhile Harry demonstrates strong technical skills and analytical thinking, the concerning patterns around feedback acceptance, collaborative decision-making, and prioritization of technical idealism over business requirements suggest significant risks for success at Amazon. The candidate would likely struggle in Amazon's high-velocity, customer-focused environment where pragmatic decisions and rapid iteration are essential.

Harry exhibits solid problem-solving skills and technical depth, particularly in machine learning and optimization, but needs development in collaborative decision-making and accepting business constraints. While showing some learning behaviors, the candidate's resistance to feedback and tendency to push personal preferences over team decisions raises concerns about cultural fit and coachability.\n\n## Overall Assessment\n**Rating: 2 - Inclined Not to Hire**\n\nThe candidate shows technical competence but exhibits concerning behavioral patterns that suggest challenges with Amazon's collaborative culture and high-velocity environment.\n\n## Earns Trust\n\nThe candidate shows mixed performance in earning trust, with some positive examples of transparency but concerning patterns of persistent pushback and resistance to team decisions. Harry demonstrated honesty by bringing forward the optimization issue in a team meeting (lines 95-96) but also showed a pattern of continuing to advocate for changes despite team pushback and tight deadlines. The candidate's approach to influencing peers appears to lack sensitivity to team dynamics and business constraints, as evidenced by the continued pushing for protocol changes despite clear feedback about priorities and timeline constraints (lines 327-347).\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Transparent about discovering and reporting the optimization performance issue to the team\n- (+) Honest about limitations and areas for improvement when reflecting on past experiences\n- (+) Took responsibility for needing to develop better domain expertise in HVAC systems\n- (+) Acknowledged the defensive reaction from teammate and reflected on better approaches\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Continued pushing for changes despite clear feedback from teammates about priorities and deadlines\n- (-) Did not demonstrate sensitivity to the impact of proposed changes on teammate's existing work\n- (-) Failed to accept team decisions and continued advocating for personal preferences\n- (-) Showed pattern of idealistic thinking over practical business considerations\n\n## Learn and Be Curious\n\nThe candidate demonstrates strong curiosity and learning behaviors in technical domains, actively seeking to understand complex systems and improve performance through deep analysis. Harry showed excellent learning agility when discovering the optimization inefficiency, conducting thorough investigation and creating comprehensive tests to validate findings (lines 109-114). However, the candidate's learning appears primarily focused on technical aspects, with less evidence of learning from interpersonal feedback or adapting collaborative approaches based on team dynamics and business requirements.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Proactively investigated performance issues and dug into code implementation details\n- (+) Created comprehensive tests to validate assumptions and prove computational equivalence\n- (+) Recognized the need for deeper domain expertise in HVAC systems for better code implementation\n- (+) Competitive programming background showing continuous technical skill development\n- (+) Self-directed learning in machine learning research environments\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Limited evidence of learning from interpersonal feedback or team dynamics\n- (-) Did not demonstrate adaptation of approach after receiving pushback from colleagues\n- (-) Focused learning primarily on technical domains rather than collaborative skills\n- (-) Missed opportunities to learn from business constraints and priority management\n\n## Dive Deep\n\nThe candidate exhibits exceptional technical depth and analytical rigor when investigating complex problems, as demonstrated by the thorough analysis of the optimization performance issue. Harry conducted detailed investigation of the code implementation, understood the underlying AdamW optimization algorithm, and created comprehensive equivalency tests with precise error margins (lines 127-133). The candidate also showed deep technical understanding across multiple domains including machine learning, HVAC systems integration, and performance optimization, demonstrating ability to work across complex technical stacks.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Conducted thorough technical investigation of optimization performance bottleneck\n- (+) Deep understanding of machine learning algorithms and their computational properties\n- (+) Created rigorous testing methodology with appropriate error tolerances for floating-point operations\n- (+) Demonstrated technical depth across multiple domains (ML, web development, system integration)\n- (+) Strong analytical skills in identifying root causes of performance issues\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Deep technical focus sometimes came at expense of understanding team priorities\n- (-) Did not dive deep into understanding team dynamics or business constraints\n- (-) Technical perfectionism may have hindered practical delivery timelines\n- (-) Limited evidence of diving deep into customer impact vs. technical elegance trade-offs\n\n## Technical Assessment\n\nThe candidate demonstrates strong technical competency with impressive competitive programming achievements and hands-on experience across multiple technology stacks. Harry showed excellent problem-solving skills in identifying and resolving the optimization performance issue, demonstrating both analytical thinking and implementation skills. The candidate's technical background spans machine learning, web development, and system integration, with practical experience in collaborative development environments including research labs and industry internships.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Top 0.5% ranking in competitive programming with 700,000+ participants\n- (+) Practical experience across ML, web development, and system integration\n- (+) Strong debugging and performance optimization skills\n- (+) Experience with collaborative development in research and industry settings\n- (+) Solid understanding of testing methodologies and validation approaches\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Technical perfectionism may impede practical delivery in business environments\n- (-) Limited experience with large-scale production systems and operational concerns\n- (-) Focus on technical elegance over business value and timeline considerations\n- (-) Inexperience with industry-standard practices for handling technical debt and trade-offs\n\n## Communication & Interpersonal Skills\n\nThe candidate demonstrates clear technical communication skills and ability to explain complex concepts effectively, as evidenced by the detailed explanation of the machine learning benchmarking project. Harry showed ability to present findings to team meetings and create visual demonstrations (graphs) to support technical arguments (lines 127-133). However, the candidate exhibited concerning patterns in handling disagreement and pushback, continuing to advocate for changes despite clear feedback about priorities and showing limited sensitivity to team dynamics and collaborative decision-making processes.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Clear and detailed explanation of complex technical concepts during the interview\n- (+) Ability to present technical findings effectively to team meetings\n- (+) Used visual aids (graphs) to support technical arguments and demonstrate equivalency\n- (+) Collaborative experience in research environments with multiple stakeholders\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Persistent advocacy for personal preferences despite team pushback and business constraints\n- (-) Limited demonstrated sensitivity to team dynamics and collaborative decision-making\n- (-) Pattern of prioritizing technical idealism over practical team considerations\n- (-) Insufficient adaptation of communication approach based on audience and context\n\n## Red Flags\n\n- Continued pushing for changes despite explicit feedback about priorities and deadlines\n- Pattern of resistance to team decisions and business constraints\n- Limited evidence of learning from interpersonal feedback\n- Tendency to prioritize technical perfection over practical delivery\n- Concerning pattern of not accepting \"no\" as an answer from teammates and management\n- Potential cultural fit issues with Amazon's customer-obsessed and ownership principles\n\n## Recommendation Summary\n\nWhile Harry demonstrates strong technical skills and analytical thinking, the concerning patterns around feedback acceptance, collaborative decision-making, and prioritization of technical idealism over business requirements suggest significant risks for success at Amazon. The candidate would likely struggle in Amazon's high-velocity, customer-focused environment where pragmatic decisions and rapid iteration are essential. The persistent pushback against team decisions and resistance to business constraints indicate potential cultural fit issues that could impact team dynamics and delivery velocity. Additional behavioral assessment and coaching would be needed to address these concerns before considering the candidate for hire.","structuredPatch":[]}}

I do competitive programming as a hobby where I am ranked, uh, in the top 0.5 percent of 700, 000 roughly participants on leap code, so I have some strong tournament finishes, including, uh, finishing top 10.\n    40→\n    41→Say 10, 000 participants with multiple top 50 and top 100 finishes.\n    42→\n    43→[Speaker 3]\n    44→Uh,\n    45→\n    46→[Speaker 1]\n    47→Early in my University experience I. Joined a machine learning research group where I initially worked on unpaid projects, just research projects. By my third year, my professor offered me an internship. Uh, opportunity, which I took and. At that time, I was able to work on a variety of tasks, including, you know, building machine learning pipelines. Writing documentation and even building web apps to deploy trained models. All of this was done in a collaborative environment where I worked closely with co-workers, managers, and clients, right?\n    48→\n    49→I also had a role like outside of academics at modest, where I built a end-to-end web application. Um. That supported features such as? Booking appointments, making purchases, you know, buying car parts? Uh, actually, processing the payments and also. Uh,\n    50→\n    51→[Speaker 3]\n    52→Like\n    53→\n    54→[Speaker 1]\n    55→Handling some internal business logic, like updating inventory spreadsheets. Do love the field of computer science. I love all the you know, fascinated by all the different problems in the field and the elegant Solutions that they require. I aspire to grow into roles where I can contribute to. The kinds of, and, you know, hopefully eventually lead the kinds of teams that are working on these projects in the real world in three columns. Yeah, that's, that's me.\n    56→\n    57→[Speaker 2]\n    58→Cool all right, um? So, my name is Ben. Uh, I'm a senior software engineer here at. Asbx, specifically on the golden bath team. Um, I've been at Amazon for, like, eight years. I want to say. Um.\n    59→\n    60→And sorry. I people were yelling at me for some issue that's currently going on. Um, gosh, I'm trying to ignore it, um? So I've been named them for 8 years. I've been kind of all over the place I originally started off in Alexa, you know, eight years ago, when it was still cool, um, working on communication software over there. So, like, how do we actually route calls from, you know, device to device got a few patents over there? To primer, so it built a lot of the Drone delivery business software. A lot of the on the ground stuff. As well as some of the the vehicle interaction stuff. Um. From there, I ended up moving over into asbx, which is kind of like Builder tools. Where I've had multiple different things in my ownership. I've had operator tooling, so how do we actually enable operators to better? Uh, serve their services during an event in a safe manner. And then, more recently, uh, the golden path team, which is kind of responsible for dictating, not dictating, uh, recommending. Services should be architecting. How services should be architected and developed so that you have the best outcomes. For the general populace, as well as publishing things like caveats for. When do ignore recommendations when to use additional toolings, etc, etc? So, you know, things like these is the right thought throttling systems you need to use. These are the ways that you set up load balancing, etc, etc.\n    61→\n    62→All right. So the way that this interview is, like, I said, gonna work because I'm just going to ask you a few questions, and we're just gonna have have a general conversation. Um, I'm gonna be taking notes over here. So, if you see me looking over here, typing that is. Perfectly fine. I'm still paying attention to you. All right, so. Let's start it off here. So, first of all? Uh, can you tell me about a time when you were trying to understand a complex system on your team? Oh, actually. Yeah, you are not an industry hire. Are you?\n    63→\n    64→[Speaker 1]\n    65→Um, sorry. What is, does that mean I'm not hired? I'm a new grad. Yeah,\n    66→\n    67→[Speaker 2]\n    68→I\n    69→\n    70→[Speaker 1]\n    71→Do have for my industry experience, uh, a story like that, yeah.\n    72→\n    73→[Speaker 2]\n    74→I I usually. So, when I prepare for interviews, I pull a question out, and then I, um, I just kind of ask it so I don't have to do any as much thinking. But since you are a new hire, this question is maybe a little bit harder for you to.\n    75→\n    76→[Speaker 1]\n    77→Uh,\n    78→\n    79→[Speaker 2]\n    80→Come up with a good answer. So, let me pick a different one real quick.\n    81→\n    82→[Speaker 1]\n    83→All right,\n    84→\n    85→[Speaker 2]\n    86→Um? Can you tell me about a problem you had to solve that required in-depth thought and Analysis?\n    87→\n    88→[Speaker 1]\n    89→Um, yeah, so? When I was working. So, while during my time at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory? I worked on a project.\n    90→\n    91→Um, essentially. Emulate, but we were building machine learning models to emulate the outputs of Earth system models. Which? All right, incredibly slow and computationally expensive to run. So, at the time, we had a suite of Legacy research tools. Which were only accessible to a command line interface. At that point, I was tasked with building a web application to integrate these, uh, existing tools and make them accessible from a website. Um.\n    92→\n    93→During my my work to integrate the optimize tool. I noticed. Essentially.\n    94→\n    95→Tool itself. When I called its API, it was very. It went extremely slowly, and I noticed this because I had set up a loading bar and a live graphing widget. To track the progress of the tool in real time. Uh, so. I noticed that for a sample batch of, say, 100 points, it took. Around three minutes to run, whereas I would have expected for that data size, uh, to maybe for it, maybe taking the range of 10 to 20 seconds around that scale, so? This prompted me to actually go ahead and look into the problem where I mean looking at the optimization function itself, where I found that. The code was like the the function was being implemented in a singular manner, such as the points were being processed, one by one rather than a batched manner, which was much faster and in my opinion standard. Uh, so because I didn't know who wrote the code, I brought this up at the next team meeting. My teammate, who had written the code, pushed back on me, saying that from his empirical tests, he found that, uh, the singular method yielded better results and was more accurate, he said. He believed that to be due to the fact that during optimization those points weren't interfering with each other. However, from my understanding of the code, and you know the functions that it calls specifically optimization using Adam W?\n    96→\n    97→Actually, there was no interference. And because of that, the two methods should be computationally identical. I explained this, but my teammates and manager weren't fully convinced. So, at that point, I mentioned that I could write. A test that proved that the two were computationally identical. In addition, you know, my team asked for some. My teammates asked for some other things, like just a graphing feature, which. I,\n    98→\n    99→[Speaker 3]\n   100→I\n   101→\n   102→[Speaker 1]\n   103→Mentioned, I would produce a graph of the results as well. So, my manager, thinking that this was, uh, worthwhile task, he basically.\n   104→\n   105→[Speaker 3]\n   106→Uh,\n   107→\n   108→[Speaker 1]\n   109→Assign this to me for the next week. Uh, and then over the next two days. I sort of wrote this test, and also, you know. Built the graph, and I presented this at the next team meeting, so the test was essentially a test of equivalency. So, at each point in this iterative optimization process at each epic, it would compare the it would run through the same batch of starting points, uh.\n   110→\n   111→Singular and to a batch method, and then it would cast for equality and also graph that, and I presented the test of this manner to my team at the next team meeting, which was enough to convince everyone that the two were actually identical. As a result. We were able to switch from the slower singular method, the faster batched method which improved the user experience by, uh.\n   112→\n   113→Optimization for a batch of roughly. 200 points, roughly 100 points from. Three minutes to just under 20 seconds, which is a speed up of nearly 10x, so 100 is a fairly standard, uh, use case. Yeah, and I suppose. Yeah, that's the story. No,\n   114→\n   115→[Speaker 2]\n   116→That mean, that makes sense. So.\n   117→\n   118→That's interest.\n   119→\n   120→You honestly did a really great job of explaining that, so I'm kind of at a loss for kind of figuring out follow-up questions here, um.\n   121→\n   122→What is your?\n   123→\n   124→So, we'll in the end, what was the outcome they did? Did you? How did you like explain to your team more about this, like, did you create? Yeah, go ahead.\n   125→\n   126→[Speaker 1]\n   127→Yeah, um, I showed them the test, which was a I showed them the exact code.\n   128→\n   129→[Speaker 2]\n   130→Uh,\n   131→\n   132→[Speaker 1]\n   133→Which was not super complicated. It was just, uh, you initialize this batch of points. You run the functions in parallel, so you step. At each step, you step it through the first function and then the second function, and you compare quality. And then, you also graph because they just requested this. You graph both points, and so we have a graph that you can track as well. And you know, at any point, the the two points are not within some really tiny margin of error, because you know, this floating Point error we're dealing with weights here? I think the error margin I set was one e to the negative eight somewhere in that range, so just completely. Tiny margin of error, so if it was not within that? It. Would the test would Mark it? And it. Notice, you know, there were no reports of, you know, for this exact instance, there were no reports of deviations from each other and the graphs were directly on top of each other and for a machine learning sort of like a training run. This is completely improbable to ever happen. If the two operations are not identical, right? So, this test? Essentially proved definitively that the two were computationally identical, and when my teammates saw this, they saw the graph they saw the code. It was enough to convince them\n   134→\n   135→[Speaker 2]\n   136→Cool. I'm not terribly familiar with machine learning. Quite Frank with you, which is not a problem, the I guess what I'm curious about is? Was there? You were able to convince this one teammate that, um, you know this, this other way was, you know, computationally equivalent, um? What was the customer benefit of? Actually, yeah, go ahead.\n   137→\n   138→[Speaker 1]\n   139→Yeah, sorry. Um, the customer benefit is that I am designing this, uh? The designing in building this web application for customer use, right? Because the idea of the web application, uh, is it's it's for it's for internal use, but it's also it's mainly for, uh, the use of our customers who maybe aren't that, technically, uh. With, you know, python, or these interfaces, and for them to be able to access our tools through a web application rather than the command line application. It's just a great ease of use for them, and they also don't have to read any documentation or any of that stuff so. When they? You know, train a sample of a hundred points here, like, optimize a sample of 100 points. They would have to wait three minutes for that optimization to finish. After this Improvement, they would only need to wait, uh, 20 seconds to get the same level of accuracy. So, that's nearly a 10x speed up. General use case, oftentimes the way that. Uh, basically, the flow of this operation tool is you set your scenarios. You fix your inputs, and then you might want to try like a bunch of different kinds of scenarios, so you might take the same or different batch of 100 points, and you want to run it through a bunch of different scenarios in all in the same setting, right? So, if the optimization run takes only 20 seconds. You can accomplish that a lot quicker. That's, that's the benefit to the customer.\n   140→\n   141→[Speaker 2]\n   142→No, that makes a lot of sense. It makes a lot of sense, so.\n   143→\n   144→Is there anything you would have done differently, or were there other places that you could have applied this learning?\n   145→\n   146→[Speaker 1]\n   147→Um.\n   148→\n   149→Um, in this in this particular story.\n   150→\n   151→I believe I handled it quite. Well, I mean, it's kind of part of why I kicked it as a story to tell, but? I, um, in some of. You know, in my earlier sort of like? Uh, when I was just onboarding onto this project. Uh, I one thing. That I could have sort of learned more about, like, I could have read the internals of the code a bit more deeply before I began interfacing with the tools because I think that that would have prevented some other like hiccups in the future. What I did. Was I sort of learned the uh interface, but I really just learned them as interfaces. I didn't bother to break open their implementation, uh? If I'd done that, I would have had actually more familiarity with the behavior of these interfaces, a lot of which they were documented. But maybe they weren't documented that well, and if I had taken that extra step to, you know, dive just a little bit deeper than I could have, uh, I could have saved myself some time. Yeah, I think the\n   152→\n   153→[Speaker 2]\n   154→I mean, it's always interesting because these are. Having success stories are really, in my mind, a opportunity to understand where you need to grow and realize that you have done some growing. Um, so knowing knowing that, like, do you think you'd be better prepared to handle a similar scenario in the future?\n   155→\n   156→[Speaker 1]\n   157→Oh, um.\n   158→\n   159→[Speaker 2]\n   160→Thinking,\n   161→\n   162→[Speaker 1]\n   163→Uh, I'm thinking about essentially. Where, like, because a few things is one, the reason that I didn't. I had to bring up the, uh, this problem in the team meeting was because I didn't know who had written the code,\n   164→\n   165→[Speaker 2]\n   166→Right? Uh, so I, I\n   167→\n   168→[Speaker 1]\n   169→Was, I was unable to sort of, like, have a one-on-one with them. I'm not sure if that caused the person to become a little, uh, like, I don't know, defensive. Yeah, defensive, uh? Because originally, when I was when I brought it up, they were convinced that Dakota had written for the batch implementation was wrong. Uh, and. I'm not. I'm not sure if that came out of a place of defense in this, or just, you know, General General curiosity. Maybe I could have approached it a bit better by, uh, getting to really. Like, I said, if I had come to understand the internals. Maybe I would have also known who who was responsible for building them, you know who, who would just sort of ask? Each of those things, and if I'd resolved that individually, maybe I could have gotten away with not even writing the test, right? Then again, having that test there is like, it's everyone is, is like with that test there. Everyone is quite sort of confident with removing this old functionality. Absolutely. The\n   170→\n   171→[Speaker 2]\n   172→Test isn't necessarily a bad thing. Yeah, I do think that there is. It does make sense that maybe there's a way a learning about how to work with, um? Even if not this person. But like, you know, you're gonna have to work with tons of different types of people, right?\n   173→\n   174→[Speaker 1]\n   175→Yeah, yeah.\n   176→\n   177→[Speaker 2]\n   178→Anyway, just a thought, all right, so? Let's go ahead and move on to to another story. Um. Can you tell me about a time? When you realize you needed a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job well.\n   179→\n   180→[Speaker 1]\n   181→Who let me think on that for a bit.\n   182→\n   183→Deeper level of subject matter expertise? Yeah, I mean so. When I was working at is another one of my internships at Pacific Northwest, National Laboratory was a different project. I was working on a project.\n   184→\n   185→[Speaker 4]\n   186→We.\n   187→\n   188→[Speaker 1]\n   189→Essentially. Benchmarking two machine learning algorithms. Uh, against each other, uh. And these machine learning algorithms were basically doing. Uh, modeling and control of temperatures within residential buildings. So, I was responsible for our clients proprietary algorithm, which was differential. Differential predictive control, right? So roughly two weeks before, uh, we had to deliver our end of quarter deadline and mine. Keep in mind this project, it was a project that was really sort of. Always had tight deadlines because our clients were quite pushy with the amount of features that they wanted done. And you know, the dates that they wanted them shipped by. So, it was always rather.\n   190→\n   191→Sorry, rather type deadlines on that project. So, roughly two weeks before the end of quarter deadline, um? I was peer programming with my teammate, who was responsible for the Deep reinforcement learning side of things, which is the other algorithm that was being benchmarked, and we were working where Pew programming together, because we were working on integration tests. Between our two modules. So during that session. I noticed. Uh, just what, what? Walk me over, uh? Part in his code again. One of the normalization, like there was a place where the code was normalizing. To a range that was slightly outside of our defined protocol. Uh, we realized that it didn't. Show up in our tests because this is something that happened in the middle of the pipeline. So, the the end pipeline sort of results still fell into the expected range of our tests so? I sort of. I pointed out the problem. Him and we, we discussed it. We verified that it actually was an error. We, uh, we fixed it. But we also considered because it wasn't a simple fix because this had. Uh, a lot of implications for our tests that have already been run right, so invalidated a lot of our previous. Test results. Uh, so realizing this, we immediately notified our manager who set up a team meeting where we sort of, you know, explained the issue. And what we believed were all the implications and the benchmarks that needed to be redone as a result.\n   192→\n   193→Our manager, you know? Seeing this, he reassigned our priorities, and he asked me to work with my teammate on resolving this issue before resuming any of our other tasking because these were essentially our core deliverables, and we were quite short on time at that point, uh, so. I collaborated with my teammate to fix the air, and but also to put in more, uh, reliable tests. Uh, so that similar cases would not, uh, happen again in the future. And then we also re-ran the experiment that were affected by this. Uh, air. And.\n   194→\n   195→As a result, we were able to deliver our. Deliverables, which is, which is that end of quarter report? Uh, on time, although you know I had to work a little bit of overtime and? My manager talked to our clients and got them to sort of push back some extra features to the next quarter. And when we delivered that report, they were satisfied with the results. So? The reason that that is a story about, you know? More domain expertise because it's because the normalization it was specifically related to.\n   196→\n   197→Uh. Some residential Building like HVAC knowledge, which uh our collaborators were mainly responsible. I guess you could do some quotes responsible, uh, for providing the domain knowledge on that part, but I found that as someone who was, you know, responsible for the implementation? Uh, lacking a full understanding of those details often led to either. Similar issues like this in my code. Or just an inability to spot these immediately in other people's code so? Yeah, that was. That was an like, I believe that if I had taken that time to, uh, sort of. They not only just into, you know, the machine learning side of things, but also try to really understand, you know, uh, the domain knowledge in those residential buildings. I could have caught this issue. Uh, sooner wrote better tests, you know to, to identify possible issues sooner. Uh, and just generally had a smoother time building this price project. Yeah. Okay.\n   198→\n   199→[Speaker 2]\n   200→I'm going to repeat it back. You just to make sure I understand exactly the story, so you, you have a machine learning algorithm that you needed to Benchmark as a part of it was for the research laboratory, which did building temperatures. I'm not really sure I\n   201→\n   202→[Speaker 1]\n   203→Got that part. Um, so the Lisa's lab toys, specifically, it's a large place. Um, the team specifically was a neuromancer team, and they were. They were developing this new sort of control algorithm because the field standard at the time was deep reinforcement learning, right?\n   204→\n   205→Algorithm called differential predictive control, which they believe could perform better in these residential buildings. So, we were tasked with benchmarking, though, so essentially, under similar conditions, similar data set sizes and training. Compute allowances. To compare comparing the performances of these two algorithms is the\n   206→\n   207→[Speaker 2]\n   208→Idea. So, so is the idea that, like, you have a predictive algorithm that runs on? Heaters to figure out when to turn on and off.\n   209→\n   210→[Speaker 1]\n   211→Yeah, so there were physical like, uh, depending on the system. They're like, essentially, physical things like valves levers. These are. These are some books that are adjusted by control. This is a two-part process. It's modeling and control, so the first part was to train something called a state space model to essentially predict what a certain the effect that a certain action would have on an environment like, say, the temperature. Like, if I perform this action, I tweak this vowel. I expect that in the next time slot. That the, uh, the room will be at this higher temperature, right? So? So that is trade on. Oh,\n   212→\n   213→[Speaker 2]\n   214→Oh, so I'm just trying to make sure I understand. So, it actually sounds kind of interesting. So, like the HVAC system itself they have, I assume some random Swedish software. You can configure the building and all the valves and stuff, and then it has. Anything else you can kind of mess or like an aircraft simulator, right? You can kind of figure out what's going to happen based off of the inputs you give it right. Standard control Theory stuff?\n   215→\n   216→[Speaker 1]\n   217→Right,\n   218→\n   219→[Speaker 2]\n   220→But then the the. I think that you do or the is specifically they have an algorithm that they use. That basically says okay, like. If I want to heat to this exact temperature, these are the valves and stuff that I should open. And we've ran this model against our like training software that our predicted our predictions software. In order to actually figure out like what the best way to do it is, and you were responsible for? Benchmarking, that to make sure that it actually was. Going to like their their model from improvements was actually going to work.\n   221→\n   222→[Speaker 1]\n   223→Um, so we were responsible for implementing and benchmarking. Okay, so we were to, essentially, under similar Fair conditions, train a controller. Which is just a model that sort of like figures out. What do to keep things in the optimal temperature range, while also using the least amount of energy?\n   224→\n   225→Um, essentially, we're training this controller over a similar data sets, you know, same same sort of data using two different algorithms. One was our client's proprietary. Differential Collective control algorithm, and the other was the field standard. Keep reinforcement learning, and the idea was that we were just. Essentially, do these trainings and then Benchmark across a variety of scenarios. The performance, right? So?\n   226→\n   227→[Speaker 2]\n   228→Yeah,\n   229→\n   230→[Speaker 1]\n   231→Uh, DPC. Differential predictive control is an additional element where? Instead of using, so we have the simulated system right for the, uh, that just gives the complete accurate temperatures of a rooms in a residential building as we sort of, you know, give different inputs to it. We call that white box, and it's one of our scenarios, but uh, we have another important scenario called Black Box where this is relevant specifically to differential predictive control. We train a neural network on the essential the phase, the state changes of the actual system to.\n   232→\n   233→Cause how that would cause the state to change, right? Like the temperature and the reason this is? Useful, I suppose, is because, uh, in actual buildings. So, if you were to generate this data in a real building, because there are some, like similar simulated buildings, but obviously every single residential building has a different design. Different mechanics in a different place, so we call those disturbances. Sometimes, you won't. You aren't actually able to physically crank up the heat, uh, and like, it's pretty costly to actually physically pull this lever and see what happens in the temperature, right? So you might only be able to do that a small amount of time and get a small data set, right? And you can't actually train a control algorithm in this kind of setting, because then you'd have to do the training with the live building. So, instead, the idea is that we make a machine learning model to sort of predict the outputs and then train a controller on that, and then we test the controller in the actual building to see how well it performs, so that's the.\n   234→\n   235→Areas where it might be kind of expensive to collect data you can't do training in real time because, you know, maybe these people in the building they want you cranking up the temperature, right,\n   236→\n   237→[Speaker 2]\n   238→Right?\n   239→\n   240→[Speaker 1]\n   241→So, you just click this update infinity. You create an emulator model, we call space, a state space model, and then you train your controllers on that and evaluate them on the real system so. Uh, that's sort of the setup. That's very\n   242→\n   243→[Speaker 2]\n   244→Cool. And so, what was the piece you needed to learn now that I understand it? Actually a little bit better,\n   245→\n   246→[Speaker 1]\n   247→Right? Uh, so the piece that I needed? Well, there was a lot, uh, to do with lending the library, but in in terms of? The question which I interpreted as sort of? When did you sort of lack domain expertise? It was in various functions. I realized that. Certain mistakes that I, I made, came from not a lack of understanding of machine learning, or, you know, software, the software and Frameworks, which I assumed initially that I was responsible for, but also just an understanding of how the HVAC sort of, uh. I guess the standard terminology in hraft works? And how that, how that translates to the libraries that we were using to? Um. Provide these building simulations, because yeah, uh, there were there. Were these, you know, various things like signals, controls, and we sort of what happened was oftentimes. In this project, we realized later on that, maybe a certain part of that library wasn't doing exactly what we thought it was doing. For example, like this normalization era that triggered, uh, the story that I was, uh?\n   248→\n   249→Because. We had we had unlimited access to the experts in HVAC, which which were our collaborators and? As a result, we sort of had limited knowledge of of the of HVAC and just the libraries that are associated with buildings and building temperatures. And that led to some again. That led to some errors that stemmed from, you know, not not realizing that. Uh, you know, certain functions you're doing certain things or certain signals were kind of like, not actually in the range that we expected.\n   250→\n   251→[Speaker 2]\n   252→I'm\n   253→\n   254→[Speaker 1]\n   255→Just thinking, if we, if I was able to, you know, really, maybe reach out independently to those collaborators or to, uh, somehow? Understand more about the the domain specific, like the the knowledge that's specific to? Buildings, then I could have, you know? Written this code to implement in Benchmark. These algorithms a lot. Better, I suppose. So, you were, you were an intern, right? Yeah, so did\n   256→\n   257→[Speaker 2]\n   258→They? What do new hires there do when they're trying to get on board into these systems? This is just kind of like a. There's no context learned by osmosis.\n   259→\n   260→[Speaker 1]\n   261→Um, yeah, so we have collaborators that are there. We have clients, and then we have collaborators and the collaborators are on our team, and they're meant to. They're Meant to help out with the domain knowledge, so these are. These, we're expected to come in with, you know, knowledge that's relevant to sort of Python and machine learning. Uh, that's sort of just the style of these. Internships. It's not like, we're joining a large project with a, with a large history. And, you know, senior sort of Engineers on that team. It's more like we're given a project that's, you know, a fairly? I guess small project by, you know, the standards of pnl probably? And we sort of meet it ourselves, and we've asked these collaborators for the knowledge that we, uh. Building knowledge. I'm not a building, they're not expecting anyone to be a buildings expert there. However, it seemed to us that during these collaborative meetings. It's just this just was too much information to really learn it. From directly from the collaborators, sort of like, there's so much domain knowledge so, uh? That sort of associated with that. A lot of times, we present art Direction, and then we'd get a course correction from these collaborators, because, oh, this domain doesn't actually care about that, or this domain knows that, you know, this certain thing is is, uh, not valuable. Yeah, so that's sort of the style, so we. It's a bit self-led, but also with help from these collaborators, and I was just. I was just thinking, I feel like\n   262→\n   263→[Speaker 2]\n   264→Most of the,\n   265→\n   266→[Speaker 1]\n   267→Uh.\n   268→\n   269→[Speaker 2]\n   270→The\n   271→\n   272→[Speaker 1]\n   273→Hiccups that came from that project actually came from a lack of domain knowledge, which maybe I could have, you know, sought out. That makes sense more independently, but because it's not really related to computer science, it was something that I initially avoided. Well, initially, I just I just took time with the collaboratories to understand my tasking, finish the tasking, but then there were later issues where they were identified based off of. Knowledge issues.\n   274→\n   275→[Speaker 2]\n   276→Nice. All, right. Well, let's move on here to the next question. Um. Can you describe a time when you needed to influence a peer? Who had a differing opinion about a shared goal.\n   277→\n   278→[Speaker 1]\n   279→I mean to be honest with you, you can say\n   280→\n   281→[Speaker 2]\n   282→No.\n   283→\n   284→[Speaker 1]\n   285→My best story for this is the uh,\n   286→\n   287→[Speaker 2]\n   288→Is the one\n   289→\n   290→[Speaker 1]\n   291→That I told about. Uh. That time that I, I sort of discovered inefficiency.\n   292→\n   293→[Speaker 2]\n   294→Oh, absolutely. Fine, you can know, is a perfectly acceptable answer,\n   295→\n   296→[Speaker 1]\n   297→Right? Um.\n   298→\n   299→[Speaker 2]\n   300→Rather, you actually be honest with me so that I can ask you a question where we can, you know, dive into some other detail. Um. Can you tell me about? Piece of tough or critical feedback that you've received.\n   301→\n   302→[Speaker 3]\n   303→But doesn't\n   304→\n   305→[Speaker 2]\n   306→Have to be. Um. Anything terribly serious, and it could just be like, you know, you? It could be anything from, like how you work together with people like you, maybe you, you know? Do you do you code in some way, people don't appreciate like it doesn't have to be like some big world ending, uh, piece of feedback. Yeah.\n   307→\n   308→[Speaker 1]\n   309→Thinking.\n   310→\n   311→[Speaker 3]\n   312→Um.\n   313→\n   314→Critical hearts feedback.\n   315→\n   316→[Speaker 1]\n   317→Um.\n   318→\n   319→So? During my time. On that project where I was benchmarking. Yeah, um. Machine learning algorithms. There was a there was a. When I I received like?\n   320→\n   321→Essentially. Me and my my co-worker, who was responsible for the DRL side of things, initially got some hiccups and getting along. Uh, because?\n   322→\n   323→[Speaker 3]\n   324→He.\n   325→\n   326→[Speaker 1]\n   327→A little critical of like? My sort of opinions on the way because I often. Oftentimes sort of. I'm a bit of an idealist like, I want things to be redone in a way. That's, uh, sort of. Well, I think would be best so. We had to find our protocol in such a way. Originally, the protocol that describes essentially the loss function and these things these are necessary for standardization between the two methods that we were benchmarking. Um, and when I initially joined the team, I was a bit, uh. I wanted. I kept sort of proposing the idea of rerunning, like rebuilding some of these systems. Because I thought that the protocol had some inefficiencies in it, and that made it hard to understand that, I thought, the uh, our customers would maybe not be too happy with. Uh, but my co-worker, I mean, so the Dr. The story here is that the DRL side is a bit older than the DPC side, so he had written already a lot of Legacy code, and I had I sort of, you know, was was starting fresh. So when I was implementing these changes, they would have been quite easy for me to implement. But on his side, it would have taken a lot of, uh, sort of. Effort there. And revision. So I was, I was, you know, pushing for these changes fairly constantly? And I received. Some critical critical feedback about sort of like? Essentially, just needing to focus down and just stick to. The deadlines and getting things done, which eventually, you know, I did. I did, uh, sort of. I didn't hear that. Um. So, for example. Originally in. Uh, client meetings up in team meetings. I would bring up, uh, just ways that we could alter our definition of a loss function to make it easier to understand and not include what I thought were sort of extraneous or pre-calculated normalization variables. I wanted to Define them smoothly in a way that would make sense and. I received. You know, quite a bit of pushback for that, but I believe that I was correct. So, I, I, I, I just pushed back in these meetings, but eventually, when my manager made the decision to just stick with the existing code because? Things were on there, uh, like, I guess we, like, I said, for this project, the type, the, the timelines were fairly tight, and we needed to deliver. Results basically every week. Uh, at that point, I just sort of. You know, put my head down. Stuck to the the plan, and I pushed out. We never ended up revising those sort of functions, uh, and we pushed back. We pushed out the result. Our clients were still satisfied with it, which is fine. I just thought it was, uh, it was an opportunity for. For a better product there.\n   328→\n   329→[Speaker 2]\n   330→Sure, I mean, what was the? Improvements to the customer outcome that you expected to get, right? Yeah, so? Um,\n   331→\n   332→[Speaker 1]\n   333→It's more of a, so the way that our loss function was defined, which was relevant for comparing these two metrics. These essentially, what we're saying is, whichever metric is better. Uh, whichever performs better on this metric. Is, we're claiming is the better algorithm right, and\n   334→\n   335→[Speaker 2]\n   336→The way\n   337→\n   338→[Speaker 1]\n   339→That these normalization. This last function was sort of computed, was it was computed using post normalization when using normalization constants that we had pre-computed from, essentially, a set of a sample of a certain number of task runs to get a range, right? So, these were like random decimals, uh?\n   340→\n   341→We briefly explained our process for generating them in the paper, but we would just set these points out and then. Just say, hey, these are. These are the constants, right? So I really thought that that. Made that sort of lack Clarity, and it took away from our claim that, hey, if it passes, if an algorithm performs better on this Benchmark on this, uh, sorry, optimization metric, it really is the better function, because if it's not like, you know, super clear to understand. I was, I felt that the people who our customers would be presenting our report to to convince them of, you know, the superiority or the? Use case. They would have trouble getting that by them because it wasn't very. Clear. Uh, so I, I was, I was, like, hey, on my code, uh, or like, I have this idea for simple fix? I'm sure it could be fixed on the other on the DRL side as well, and we can have like a, you know, a well-defined function that is defined in terms of non-normalized values, so we don't need all of these random terms. But yeah, I I just? Yeah, so I received sort of pushback and\n   342→\n   343→[Speaker 4]\n   344→Essentially pushing for.\n   345→\n   346→[Speaker 1]\n   347→It didn't take deadlines for it. Things that were not super in my in the eyes of my teammates, not super relevant.\n   348→\n   349→[Speaker 2]\n   350→That makes sense, and so. Dee, would you still push for them today?\n   351→\n   352→[Speaker 1]\n   353→Um. I would. Maybe I would push that would maybe just bring up the idea and under the understanding that everyone is sort of under tight deadlines. I think I would stop if. You know at the point that my teammate sort of clarified, uh, their situation, so why, uh, this wasn't a good idea? Yeah, did\n   354→\n   355→[Speaker 2]\n   356→You talk to the people that had to actually go and explain it to the customers?\n   357→\n   358→[Speaker 1]\n   359→Um, yeah, they sort of mentioned that. They would prefer. If that was? If that wasn't the case, I didn't. I I mentioned this at a time that was earlier on in the project again. Had limited access to these collaborators, so I wasn't asking them this question every single week, and that sort of where I both. I got for where I sort of cemented that idea that I ended up pushing for it a bit further. I'm not sure how exactly relevant it was for them, because at that point in Project, we weren't sort of splitting hairs between, uh. Which features we can. We can actually fit into our report, in which features we have to toss, which is sort of the situation we got in. Towards the end of the quarter.\n   360→\n   361→[Speaker 2]\n   362→Cool!\n   363→\n   364→[Speaker 1]\n   365→All, right. Well, I think.\n   366→\n   367→[Speaker 2]\n   368→That is all of my questions. Um, do you have any questions for me?\n   369→\n   370→[Speaker 1]\n   371→Oh yeah, so you said, I mean? You're a senior software engineer, right? You start as an sd1 at Amazon,\n   372→\n   373→[Speaker 2]\n   374→Started as an intern. Oh,\n   375→\n   376→[Speaker 1]\n   377→Did you move to some internet sd1 or directly?\n   378→\n   379→[Speaker 2]\n   380→Yeah, so you so the way the internships work is you intern over the summer and then you? You can come back after your. Uh, you know, year of college as an sd1?\n   381→\n   382→[Speaker 1]\n   383→Oh, I see. So, if you, if you've been in sd1, what do you think? Things that you want to like, what do? What are the things that successful sd1s do? Uh, to succeed in that role, and what are the pitfalls, uh, common pitfalls that people fall into in that rule, um?\n   384→\n   385→[Speaker 2]\n   386→So, what is? The job expectations of an sde one are are definitely the important thing to look at, right? So an sde one is, as I like to explain, it is basically just a full-time intern. Um, it's essentially where we bring in developers to give them a longer chance to prove that they can grow into productive. Engineers, and so being a productive engineer means multiple different things, does it? It means that you are able to complete your job with minimal oversight from others, right? So, we, we kind of expect, um. Nsd, you want to need a lot of guidance. But every ste one is judged based off of the ability to grow into an sde2, right, and so as an sd1, we expect you to be able to complete tasks that are well defined, but we also expect you to be able to. Figure out the gaps. Tasks that maybe aren't as well defined, right. Like, you need to be able to show that you have critical thinking skills throughout the entire software architecture chain to make sure that you can get you know. You can take ambiguous more and more ambiguous problems as you go and turn them into concrete Solutions. Additionally, it's a lot of. How much?\n   387→\n   388→Correction. Do you need right? So, a lot of SCU ones are. The writing code that's maybe not perfect. Maybe the writing code that's too perfect, but? Doesn't actually work for the business, right? Like, where, where are you actually prioritizing your time? Right is, is kind of very important, and then obviously just operational. Like, it's something that you're not really. Exposed to when you are a not in Industry, kind of the operations of maintaining large-scale systems that are currently operating, and so being on call and being able to handle yourself are very important.\n   389→\n   390→[Speaker 1]\n   391→Uh, and what about the pitfalls? So,\n   392→\n   393→[Speaker 2]\n   394→Explain what you mean by pitfalls of being an SD one.\n   395→\n   396→[Speaker 1]\n   397→What are common things that cause people to, uh, in an sd1 rule, not either, not progress to sd2 or just be leave the company?\n   398→\n   399→[Speaker 2]\n   400→Commonly, it is a failure to grow, um, things. I often see from sdu ones that, um, are not successful, is they do not under. They don't make the transition to understanding that, um. The work that you provide needs to be ambiguous, and you need to have high standards for ambiguous work, right? It's not necessarily that, okay, I need to get something done. It's, I need to get something done right. I don't need to be told what to do. I should understand what to do properly. A lot of it is,\n   401→\n   402→[Speaker 1]\n   403→Um.\n   404→\n   405→[Speaker 2]\n   406→Failure to grow to understand the changing requirements of software systems and that they serve the business, not necessarily. Um, being a code purist, right, like the end of the day, like we may or may not make changes based off of timelines and the things that we would need to get done in order to continue to make money. Um,\n   407→\n   408→[Speaker 3]\n   409→Yeah, and so it's\n   410→\n   411→[Speaker 2]\n   412→A lot of. Usually, it's a mental shift. The the coding bar to get into Amazon is fine, like, whatever, as long as you can code, I really don't care. It's the ability to understand and work with others, um. And know that the business is, you're here to serve the business. It's kind of the the major downfall I see from people.\n   413→\n   414→[Speaker 3]\n   415→Obviously, you have to\n   416→\n   417→[Speaker 2]\n   418→Be able to code, but like, if if you can't code, I can't fix that for you. Um, yeah, it's a\n   419→\n   420→[Speaker 1]\n   421→Lot\n   422→\n   423→[Speaker 2]\n   424→Of the soft skills that really prevent people from getting from one to two. If it's not just coding?\n   425→\n   426→[Speaker 1]\n   427→Um, yeah, I just had a question from your response. It was, uh, what do you mean by high standards for ambiguous code, like our ambiguous deliverables, um?\n   428→\n   429→[Speaker 2]\n   430→So, let's say I am building a piece of software. I need an API to do something. If you are building me an API that just does what I need it to do, but you don't consider the fact that it might grow in the future. Right, like, did you hard code in a bunch of stuff that gets it working now, but causes Tech debt in the future? Right, like, do you not understand the the wins the way the winds are blowing? So, like, can you look forward like three to six months to understand the code changes. We're gonna have to make then so that the stuff that you make now isn't going to. Give us downtime or outages or additional, you know? Development work that needs to be done in the future in order to undo some of the stuff you just did.\n   431→\n   432→Not\n   433→\n   434→[Speaker 3]\n   435→Sure?\n   436→\n   437→[Speaker 1]\n   438→Um. All right. Can I got one more question for you if you don't mind, uh? Is your favorite and least favorite part about the work culture at Amazon?\n   439→\n   440→[Speaker 2]\n   441→Favorite and least favorite. Amazon, the I think one of my favorite things about Amazon is it's kind of a. You can choose your own destiny. Kind of company. If you put in a lot of work and a lot of effort, you can see yourself, you know. Rise through the ranks. You can kind of find Opportunities. That you don't necessarily need to be given by your manager. You can go and talk to leaders to say this is something we should be doing. Make a case for it. And then, you know, make it happen. It is perfectly reasonable thing to happen here, which I don't think is often appreciated at other companies. Um, on the other side of that. Uh, one of my least favorite things about Amazon, it's. It's a large company, and so you have to deal with a lot of large company crap where you know there you have. You don't always have control, and your immediate leadership doesn't always have control over different parts of you know what your wife is like at Amazon, right? Like, we don't necessarily control RTO. So, like, we go back to the office five days a week, right? I'm sure everyone does that. Um, many people would prefer. We stayed at three three days a week, or we just were fully remote, but? Larger company. You don't really have access to some of the decision makers for those types of things. Right?\n   442→\n   443→[Speaker 1]\n   444→Gotcha. Overall,\n   445→\n   446→[Speaker 2]\n   447→I enjoy working here.\n   448→\n   449→[Speaker 1]\n   450→Oh, that's good to hear.\n   451→\n   452→[Speaker 2]\n   453→Supposed we have a bit of time remaining for? Like, I said, we, we don't have to take up the full amount of time this. This interview doesn't always take up the full hour. Yeah,\n   454→\n   455→[Speaker 1]\n   456→I mean, I guess I could ask you,\n   457→\n   458→[Speaker 2]\n   459→Yeah, one more thing. Well,\n   460→\n   461→[Speaker 1]\n   462→I'm just curious about, uh. So, when what was the last major failure that uh happened at, like either either something you were directly responsible for or just the team that you were on. And what sort of caused it and what could have prevented it? So? That.\n   463→\n   464→[Speaker 2]\n   465→An interesting question because my current team doesn't really own anything. Um, my team kind of writes recommendations and templates, and builds out libraries and software that's not actually running Production Services. And so. Have not really had serious outages for code that we owned, and it's, I've been on this team for like two years, so it's kind of. It's a semi-difficult question to answer. I've been on some very serious, um. Calls before, but? Um, I can't necessarily answer that. Oh yeah, yeah, I mean, that's true. All right. Yeah, I think, uh, I think those are all the questions I have for you. Cool. All, right? Well, hey, I think. You have a break after this. If I'm correct, I\n   466→\n   467→[Speaker 1]\n   468→Do so. Yeah, all right. Well, good luck in your next interview. Thank\n   469→\n   470→[Speaker 2]\n   471→You! Nice meeting! You hope to, uh, work together in the future all right, bye!\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious.

Hey Ben.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nHow you doing?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI'm doing well. How about you\n\n[Speaker 2]\nDoing great? You know, just getting into the swing of the day?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nYeah.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll right. Oh no, you're on the west coast as well. Yeah,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYep, out here in Seattle.\n\nHey, sorry,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nMy chime crashed there. I was just about to say, yeah, you're on the West Coast, right? You're in Seattle,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSure am. Yeah, chime is not my favorite piece of equipment.\n\nAll right, um, so sorry, what's where were we? Um. So? My name's Ben. It's nice to meet you. Um. The way this interview is kind of kind of go is we're going to do some quick introductions. Um, and then you and I are just going to kind of have a conversation for an hour, um, where I really kind of want to dig into some of the details of the stories that you're telling me. Um, and then I'll leave a little bit of time at the end for us to, you know, for you to ask me any questions. Um, we're not going to do any coding in in this interview. Okay. So, this interview might not last the full hour. I mean, that's perfectly okay.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nOkay, um?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCool, so why don't we started off, and uh, have you tell a little bit? Tell me a little about yourself.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, so I'm Harry. I'm a recent graduate from, uh? Lesson, Washington University with a bachelor's in computer science. Uh, I really do love programming. I do competitive programming as a hobby where I am ranked, uh, in the top 0.5 percent of 700, 000 roughly participants on leap code, so I have some strong tournament finishes, including, uh, finishing top 10.\n\nSay 10, 000 participants with multiple top 50 and top 100 finishes.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nEarly in my University experience I. Joined a machine learning research group where I initially worked on unpaid projects, just research projects. By my third year, my professor offered me an internship. Uh, opportunity, which I took and. At that time, I was able to work on a variety of tasks, including, you know, building machine learning pipelines. Writing documentation and even building web apps to deploy trained models. All of this was done in a collaborative environment where I worked closely with co-workers, managers, and clients, right?\n\nI also had a role like outside of academics at modest, where I built a end-to-end web application. Um. That supported features such as? Booking appointments, making purchases, you know, buying car parts? Uh, actually, processing the payments and also. Uh,\n\n[Speaker 3]\nLike\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHandling some internal business logic, like updating inventory spreadsheets. Do love the field of computer science. I love all the you know, fascinated by all the different problems in the field and the elegant Solutions that they require. I aspire to grow into roles where I can contribute to. The kinds of, and, you know, hopefully eventually lead the kinds of teams that are working on these projects in the real world in three columns. Yeah, that's, that's me.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCool all right, um? So, my name is Ben. Uh, I'm a senior software engineer here at. Asbx, specifically on the golden bath team. Um, I've been at Amazon for, like, eight years. I want to say. Um.\n\nAnd sorry. I people were yelling at me for some issue that's currently going on. Um, gosh, I'm trying to ignore it, um? So I've been named them for 8 years. I've been kind of all over the place I originally started off in Alexa, you know, eight years ago, when it was still cool, um, working on communication software over there. So, like, how do we actually route calls from, you know, device to device got a few patents over there? To primer, so it built a lot of the Drone delivery business software. A lot of the on the ground stuff. As well as some of the the vehicle interaction stuff. Um. From there, I ended up moving over into asbx, which is kind of like Builder tools. Where I've had multiple different things in my ownership. I've had operator tooling, so how do we actually enable operators to better? Uh, serve their services during an event in a safe manner. And then, more recently, uh, the golden path team, which is kind of responsible for dictating, not dictating, uh, recommending. Services should be architecting. How services should be architected and developed so that you have the best outcomes. For the general populace, as well as publishing things like caveats for. When do ignore recommendations when to use additional toolings, etc, etc? So, you know, things like these is the right thought throttling systems you need to use. These are the ways that you set up load balancing, etc, etc.\n\nAll right. So the way that this interview is, like, I said, gonna work because I'm just going to ask you a few questions, and we're just gonna have have a general conversation. Um, I'm gonna be taking notes over here. So, if you see me looking over here, typing that is. Perfectly fine. I'm still paying attention to you. All right, so. Let's start it off here. So, first of all? Uh, can you tell me about a time when you were trying to understand a complex system on your team? Oh, actually. Yeah, you are not an industry hire. Are you?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm, sorry. What is, does that mean I'm not hired? I'm a new grad. Yeah,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI\n\n[Speaker 1]\nDo have for my industry experience, uh, a story like that, yeah.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI I usually. So, when I prepare for interviews, I pull a question out, and then I, um, I just kind of ask it so I don't have to do any as much thinking. But since you are a new hire, this question is maybe a little bit harder for you to.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCome up with a good answer. So, let me pick a different one real quick.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll right,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm? Can you tell me about a problem you had to solve that required in-depth thought and Analysis?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm, yeah, so? When I was working. So, while during my time at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory? I worked on a project.\n\nUm, essentially. Emulate, but we were building machine learning models to emulate the outputs of Earth system models. Which? All right, incredibly slow and computationally expensive to run. So, at the time, we had a suite of Legacy research tools. Which were only accessible to a command line interface. At that point, I was tasked with building a web application to integrate these, uh, existing tools and make them accessible from a website. Um.\n\nDuring my my work to integrate the optimize tool. I noticed. Essentially.\n\nTool itself. When I called its API, it was very. It went extremely slowly, and I noticed this because I had set up a loading bar and a live graphing widget. To track the progress of the tool in real time. Uh, so. I noticed that for a sample batch of, say, 100 points, it took. Around three minutes to run, whereas I would have expected for that data size, uh, to maybe for it, maybe taking the range of 10 to 20 seconds around that scale, so? This prompted me to actually go ahead and look into the problem where I mean looking at the optimization function itself, where I found that. The code was like the the function was being implemented in a singular manner, such as the points were being processed, one by one rather than a batched manner, which was much faster and in my opinion standard. Uh, so because I didn't know who wrote the code, I brought this up at the next team meeting. My teammate, who had written the code, pushed back on me, saying that from his empirical tests, he found that, uh, the singular method yielded better results and was more accurate, he said. He believed that to be due to the fact that during optimization those points weren't interfering with each other. However, from my understanding of the code, and you know the functions that it calls specifically optimization using Adam W?\n\nActually, there was no interference. And because of that, the two methods should be computationally identical. I explained this, but my teammates and manager weren't fully convinced. So, at that point, I mentioned that I could write. A test that proved that the two were computationally identical. In addition, you know, my team asked for some. My teammates asked for some other things, like just a graphing feature, which. I,\n\n[Speaker 3]\nI\n\n[Speaker 1]\nMentioned, I would produce a graph of the results as well. So, my manager, thinking that this was, uh, worthwhile task, he basically.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAssign this to me for the next week. Uh, and then over the next two days. I sort of wrote this test, and also, you know. Built the graph, and I presented this at the next team meeting, so the test was essentially a test of equivalency. So, at each point in this iterative optimization process at each epic, it would compare the it would run through the same batch of starting points, uh.\n\nSingular and to a batch method, and then it would cast for equality and also graph that, and I presented the test of this manner to my team at the next team meeting, which was enough to convince everyone that the two were actually identical. As a result. We were able to switch from the slower singular method, the faster batched method which improved the user experience by, uh.\n\nOptimization for a batch of roughly. 200 points, roughly 100 points from. Three minutes to just under 20 seconds, which is a speed up of nearly 10x, so 100 is a fairly standard, uh, use case. Yeah, and I suppose. Yeah, that's the story. No,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThat mean, that makes sense. So.\n\nThat's interest.\n\nYou honestly did a really great job of explaining that, so I'm kind of at a loss for kind of figuring out follow-up questions here, um.\n\nWhat is your?\n\nSo, we'll in the end, what was the outcome they did? Did you? How did you like explain to your team more about this, like, did you create? Yeah, go ahead.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, um, I showed them the test, which was a I showed them the exact code.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhich was not super complicated. It was just, uh, you initialize this batch of points. You run the functions in parallel, so you step. At each step, you step it through the first function and then the second function, and you compare quality. And then, you also graph because they just requested this. You graph both points, and so we have a graph that you can track as well. And you know, at any point, the the two points are not within some really tiny margin of error, because you know, this floating Point error we're dealing with weights here? I think the error margin I set was one e to the negative eight somewhere in that range, so just completely. Tiny margin of error, so if it was not within that? It. Would the test would Mark it? And it. Notice, you know, there were no reports of, you know, for this exact instance, there were no reports of deviations from each other and the graphs were directly on top of each other and for a machine learning sort of like a training run. This is completely improbable to ever happen. If the two operations are not identical, right? So, this test? Essentially proved definitively that the two were computationally identical, and when my teammates saw this, they saw the graph they saw the code. It was enough to convince them\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCool. I'm not terribly familiar with machine learning. Quite Frank with you, which is not a problem, the I guess what I'm curious about is? Was there? You were able to convince this one teammate that, um, you know this, this other way was, you know, computationally equivalent, um? What was the customer benefit of? Actually, yeah, go ahead.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, sorry. Um, the customer benefit is that I am designing this, uh? The designing in building this web application for customer use, right? Because the idea of the web application, uh, is it's it's for it's for internal use, but it's also it's mainly for, uh, the use of our customers who maybe aren't that, technically, uh. With, you know, python, or these interfaces, and for them to be able to access our tools through a web application rather than the command line application. It's just a great ease of use for them, and they also don't have to read any documentation or any of that stuff so. When they? You know, train a sample of a hundred points here, like, optimize a sample of 100 points. They would have to wait three minutes for that optimization to finish. After this Improvement, they would only need to wait, uh, 20 seconds to get the same level of accuracy. So, that's nearly a 10x speed up. General use case, oftentimes the way that. Uh, basically, the flow of this operation tool is you set your scenarios. You fix your inputs, and then you might want to try like a bunch of different kinds of scenarios, so you might take the same or different batch of 100 points, and you want to run it through a bunch of different scenarios in all in the same setting, right? So, if the optimization run takes only 20 seconds. You can accomplish that a lot quicker. That's, that's the benefit to the customer.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNo, that makes a lot of sense. It makes a lot of sense, so.\n\nIs there anything you would have done differently, or were there other places that you could have applied this learning?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm.\n\nUm, in this in this particular story.\n\nI believe I handled it quite. Well, I mean, it's kind of part of why I kicked it as a story to tell, but? I, um, in some of. You know, in my earlier sort of like? Uh, when I was just onboarding onto this project. Uh, I one thing. That I could have sort of learned more about, like, I could have read the internals of the code a bit more deeply before I began interfacing with the tools because I think that that would have prevented some other like hiccups in the future. What I did. Was I sort of learned the uh interface, but I really just learned them as interfaces. I didn't bother to break open their implementation, uh? If I'd done that, I would have had actually more familiarity with the behavior of these interfaces, a lot of which they were documented. But maybe they weren't documented that well, and if I had taken that extra step to, you know, dive just a little bit deeper than I could have, uh, I could have saved myself some time. Yeah, I think the\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI mean, it's always interesting because these are. Having success stories are really, in my mind, a opportunity to understand where you need to grow and realize that you have done some growing. Um, so knowing knowing that, like, do you think you'd be better prepared to handle a similar scenario in the future?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOh, um.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThinking,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh, I'm thinking about essentially. Where, like, because a few things is one, the reason that I didn't. I had to bring up the, uh, this problem in the team meeting was because I didn't know who had written the code,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nRight? Uh, so I, I\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWas, I was unable to sort of, like, have a one-on-one with them. I'm not sure if that caused the person to become a little, uh, like, I don't know, defensive. Yeah, defensive, uh? Because originally, when I was when I brought it up, they were convinced that Dakota had written for the batch implementation was wrong. Uh, and. I'm not. I'm not sure if that came out of a place of defense in this, or just, you know, General General curiosity. Maybe I could have approached it a bit better by, uh, getting to really. Like, I said, if I had come to understand the internals. Maybe I would have also known who who was responsible for building them, you know who, who would just sort of ask? Each of those things, and if I'd resolved that individually, maybe I could have gotten away with not even writing the test, right? Then again, having that test there is like, it's everyone is, is like with that test there. Everyone is quite sort of confident with removing this old functionality. Absolutely. The\n\n[Speaker 2]\nTest isn't necessarily a bad thing. Yeah, I do think that there is. It does make sense that maybe there's a way a learning about how to work with, um? Even if not this person. But like, you know, you're gonna have to work with tons of different types of people, right?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, yeah.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAnyway, just a thought, all right, so? Let's go ahead and move on to to another story. Um. Can you tell me about a time? When you realize you needed a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job well.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWho let me think on that for a bit.\n\nDeeper level of subject matter expertise? Yeah, I mean so. When I was working at is another one of my internships at Pacific Northwest, National Laboratory was a different project. I was working on a project.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nWe.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nEssentially. Benchmarking two machine learning algorithms. Uh, against each other, uh. And these machine learning algorithms were basically doing. Uh, modeling and control of temperatures within residential buildings. So, I was responsible for our clients proprietary algorithm, which was differential. Differential predictive control, right? So roughly two weeks before, uh, we had to deliver our end of quarter deadline and mine. Keep in mind this project, it was a project that was really sort of. Always had tight deadlines because our clients were quite pushy with the amount of features that they wanted done. And you know, the dates that they wanted them shipped by. So, it was always rather.\n\nSorry, rather type deadlines on that project. So, roughly two weeks before the end of quarter deadline, um? I was peer programming with my teammate, who was responsible for the Deep reinforcement learning side of things, which is the other algorithm that was being benchmarked, and we were working where Pew programming together, because we were working on integration tests. Between our two modules. So during that session. I noticed. Uh, just what, what? Walk me over, uh? Part in his code again. One of the normalization, like there was a place where the code was normalizing. To a range that was slightly outside of our defined protocol. Uh, we realized that it didn't. Show up in our tests because this is something that happened in the middle of the pipeline. So, the the end pipeline sort of results still fell into the expected range of our tests so? I sort of. I pointed out the problem. Him and we, we discussed it. We verified that it actually was an error. We, uh, we fixed it. But we also considered because it wasn't a simple fix because this had. Uh, a lot of implications for our tests that have already been run right, so invalidated a lot of our previous. Test results. Uh, so realizing this, we immediately notified our manager who set up a team meeting where we sort of, you know, explained the issue. And what we believed were all the implications and the benchmarks that needed to be redone as a result.\n\nOur manager, you know? Seeing this, he reassigned our priorities, and he asked me to work with my teammate on resolving this issue before resuming any of our other tasking because these were essentially our core deliverables, and we were quite short on time at that point, uh, so. I collaborated with my teammate to fix the air, and but also to put in more, uh, reliable tests. Uh, so that similar cases would not, uh, happen again in the future. And then we also re-ran the experiment that were affected by this. Uh, air. And.\n\nAs a result, we were able to deliver our. Deliverables, which is, which is that end of quarter report? Uh, on time, although you know I had to work a little bit of overtime and? My manager talked to our clients and got them to sort of push back some extra features to the next quarter. And when we delivered that report, they were satisfied with the results. So? The reason that that is a story about, you know? More domain expertise because it's because the normalization it was specifically related to.\n\nUh. Some residential Building like HVAC knowledge, which uh our collaborators were mainly responsible. I guess you could do some quotes responsible, uh, for providing the domain knowledge on that part, but I found that as someone who was, you know, responsible for the implementation? Uh, lacking a full understanding of those details often led to either. Similar issues like this in my code. Or just an inability to spot these immediately in other people's code so? Yeah, that was. That was an like, I believe that if I had taken that time to, uh, sort of. They not only just into, you know, the machine learning side of things, but also try to really understand, you know, uh, the domain knowledge in those residential buildings. I could have caught this issue. Uh, sooner wrote better tests, you know to, to identify possible issues sooner. Uh, and just generally had a smoother time building this price project. Yeah. Okay.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI'm going to repeat it back. You just to make sure I understand exactly the story, so you, you have a machine learning algorithm that you needed to Benchmark as a part of it was for the research laboratory, which did building temperatures. I'm not really sure I\n\n[Speaker 1]\nGot that part. Um, so the Lisa's lab toys, specifically, it's a large place. Um, the team specifically was a neuromancer team, and they were. They were developing this new sort of control algorithm because the field standard at the time was deep reinforcement learning, right?\n\nAlgorithm called differential predictive control, which they believe could perform better in these residential buildings. So, we were tasked with benchmarking, though, so essentially, under similar conditions, similar data set sizes and training. Compute allowances. To compare comparing the performances of these two algorithms is the\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIdea. So, so is the idea that, like, you have a predictive algorithm that runs on? Heaters to figure out when to turn on and off.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, so there were physical like, uh, depending on the system. They're like, essentially, physical things like valves levers. These are. These are some books that are adjusted by control. This is a two-part process. It's modeling and control, so the first part was to train something called a state space model to essentially predict what a certain the effect that a certain action would have on an environment like, say, the temperature. Like, if I perform this action, I tweak this vowel. I expect that in the next time slot. That the, uh, the room will be at this higher temperature, right? So? So that is trade on. Oh,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOh, so I'm just trying to make sure I understand. So, it actually sounds kind of interesting. So, like the HVAC system itself they have, I assume some random Swedish software. You can configure the building and all the valves and stuff, and then it has. Anything else you can kind of mess or like an aircraft simulator, right? You can kind of figure out what's going to happen based off of the inputs you give it right. Standard control Theory stuff?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nBut then the the. I think that you do or the is specifically they have an algorithm that they use. That basically says okay, like. If I want to heat to this exact temperature, these are the valves and stuff that I should open. And we've ran this model against our like training software that our predicted our predictions software. In order to actually figure out like what the best way to do it is, and you were responsible for? Benchmarking, that to make sure that it actually was. Going to like their their model from improvements was actually going to work.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm, so we were responsible for implementing and benchmarking. Okay, so we were to, essentially, under similar Fair conditions, train a controller. Which is just a model that sort of like figures out. What do to keep things in the optimal temperature range, while also using the least amount of energy?\n\nUm, essentially, we're training this controller over a similar data sets, you know, same same sort of data using two different algorithms. One was our client's proprietary. Differential Collective control algorithm, and the other was the field standard. Keep reinforcement learning, and the idea was that we were just. Essentially, do these trainings and then Benchmark across a variety of scenarios. The performance, right? So?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh, DPC. Differential predictive control is an additional element where? Instead of using, so we have the simulated system right for the, uh, that just gives the complete accurate temperatures of a rooms in a residential building as we sort of, you know, give different inputs to it. We call that white box, and it's one of our scenarios, but uh, we have another important scenario called Black Box where this is relevant specifically to differential predictive control. We train a neural network on the essential the phase, the state changes of the actual system to.\n\nCause how that would cause the state to change, right? Like the temperature and the reason this is? Useful, I suppose, is because, uh, in actual buildings. So, if you were to generate this data in a real building, because there are some, like similar simulated buildings, but obviously every single residential building has a different design. Different mechanics in a different place, so we call those disturbances. Sometimes, you won't. You aren't actually able to physically crank up the heat, uh, and like, it's pretty costly to actually physically pull this lever and see what happens in the temperature, right? So you might only be able to do that a small amount of time and get a small data set, right? And you can't actually train a control algorithm in this kind of setting, because then you'd have to do the training with the live building. So, instead, the idea is that we make a machine learning model to sort of predict the outputs and then train a controller on that, and then we test the controller in the actual building to see how well it performs, so that's the.\n\nAreas where it might be kind of expensive to collect data you can't do training in real time because, you know, maybe these people in the building they want you cranking up the temperature, right,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nRight?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, you just click this update infinity. You create an emulator model, we call space, a state space model, and then you train your controllers on that and evaluate them on the real system so. Uh, that's sort of the setup. That's very\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCool. And so, what was the piece you needed to learn now that I understand it? Actually a little bit better,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight? Uh, so the piece that I needed? Well, there was a lot, uh, to do with lending the library, but in in terms of? The question which I interpreted as sort of? When did you sort of lack domain expertise? It was in various functions. I realized that. Certain mistakes that I, I made, came from not a lack of understanding of machine learning, or, you know, software, the software and Frameworks, which I assumed initially that I was responsible for, but also just an understanding of how the HVAC sort of, uh. I guess the standard terminology in hraft works? And how that, how that translates to the libraries that we were using to? Um. Provide these building simulations, because yeah, uh, there were there. Were these, you know, various things like signals, controls, and we sort of what happened was oftentimes. In this project, we realized later on that, maybe a certain part of that library wasn't doing exactly what we thought it was doing. For example, like this normalization era that triggered, uh, the story that I was, uh?\n\nBecause. We had we had unlimited access to the experts in HVAC, which which were our collaborators and? As a result, we sort of had limited knowledge of of the of HVAC and just the libraries that are associated with buildings and building temperatures. And that led to some again. That led to some errors that stemmed from, you know, not not realizing that. Uh, you know, certain functions you're doing certain things or certain signals were kind of like, not actually in the range that we expected.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI'm\n\n[Speaker 1]\nJust thinking, if we, if I was able to, you know, really, maybe reach out independently to those collaborators or to, uh, somehow? Understand more about the the domain specific, like the the knowledge that's specific to? Buildings, then I could have, you know? Written this code to implement in Benchmark. These algorithms a lot. Better, I suppose. So, you were, you were an intern, right? Yeah, so did\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThey? What do new hires there do when they're trying to get on board into these systems? This is just kind of like a. There's no context learned by osmosis.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm, yeah, so we have collaborators that are there. We have clients, and then we have collaborators and the collaborators are on our team, and they're meant to. They're Meant to help out with the domain knowledge, so these are. These, we're expected to come in with, you know, knowledge that's relevant to sort of Python and machine learning. Uh, that's sort of just the style of these. Internships. It's not like, we're joining a large project with a, with a large history. And, you know, senior sort of Engineers on that team. It's more like we're given a project that's, you know, a fairly? I guess small project by, you know, the standards of pnl probably? And we sort of meet it ourselves, and we've asked these collaborators for the knowledge that we, uh. Building knowledge. I'm not a building, they're not expecting anyone to be a buildings expert there. However, it seemed to us that during these collaborative meetings. It's just this just was too much information to really learn it. From directly from the collaborators, sort of like, there's so much domain knowledge so, uh? That sort of associated with that. A lot of times, we present art Direction, and then we'd get a course correction from these collaborators, because, oh, this domain doesn't actually care about that, or this domain knows that, you know, this certain thing is is, uh, not valuable. Yeah, so that's sort of the style, so we. It's a bit self-led, but also with help from these collaborators, and I was just. I was just thinking, I feel like\n\n[Speaker 2]\nMost of the,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThe\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHiccups that came from that project actually came from a lack of domain knowledge, which maybe I could have, you know, sought out. That makes sense more independently, but because it's not really related to computer science, it was something that I initially avoided. Well, initially, I just I just took time with the collaboratories to understand my tasking, finish the tasking, but then there were later issues where they were identified based off of. Knowledge issues.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNice. All, right. Well, let's move on here to the next question. Um. Can you describe a time when you needed to influence a peer? Who had a differing opinion about a shared goal.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI mean to be honest with you, you can say\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNo.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nMy best story for this is the uh,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIs the one\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThat I told about. Uh. That time that I, I sort of discovered inefficiency.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOh, absolutely. Fine, you can know, is a perfectly acceptable answer,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight? Um.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nRather, you actually be honest with me so that I can ask you a question where we can, you know, dive into some other detail. Um. Can you tell me about? Piece of tough or critical feedback that you've received.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nBut doesn't\n\n[Speaker 2]\nHave to be. Um. Anything terribly serious, and it could just be like, you know, you? It could be anything from, like how you work together with people like you, maybe you, you know? Do you do you code in some way, people don't appreciate like it doesn't have to be like some big world ending, uh, piece of feedback. Yeah.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThinking.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUm.\n\nCritical hearts feedback.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm.\n\nSo? During my time. On that project where I was benchmarking. Yeah, um. Machine learning algorithms. There was a there was a. When I I received like?\n\nEssentially. Me and my my co-worker, who was responsible for the DRL side of things, initially got some hiccups and getting along. Uh, because?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nHe.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nA little critical of like? My sort of opinions on the way because I often. Oftentimes sort of. I'm a bit of an idealist like, I want things to be redone in a way. That's, uh, sort of. Well, I think would be best so. We had to find our protocol in such a way. Originally, the protocol that describes essentially the loss function and these things these are necessary for standardization between the two methods that we were benchmarking. Um, and when I initially joined the team, I was a bit, uh. I wanted. I kept sort of proposing the idea of rerunning, like rebuilding some of these systems. Because I thought that the protocol had some inefficiencies in it, and that made it hard to understand that, I thought, the uh, our customers would maybe not be too happy with. Uh, but my co-worker, I mean, so the Dr. The story here is that the DRL side is a bit older than the DPC side, so he had written already a lot of Legacy code, and I had I sort of, you know, was was starting fresh. So when I was implementing these changes, they would have been quite easy for me to implement. But on his side, it would have taken a lot of, uh, sort of. Effort there. And revision. So I was, I was, you know, pushing for these changes fairly constantly? And I received. Some critical critical feedback about sort of like? Essentially, just needing to focus down and just stick to. The deadlines and getting things done, which eventually, you know, I did. I did, uh, sort of. I didn't hear that. Um. So, for example. Originally in. Uh, client meetings up in team meetings. I would bring up, uh, just ways that we could alter our definition of a loss function to make it easier to understand and not include what I thought were sort of extraneous or pre-calculated normalization variables. I wanted to Define them smoothly in a way that would make sense and. I received. You know, quite a bit of pushback for that, but I believe that I was correct. So, I, I, I, I just pushed back in these meetings, but eventually, when my manager made the decision to just stick with the existing code because? Things were on there, uh, like, I guess we, like, I said, for this project, the type, the, the timelines were fairly tight, and we needed to deliver. Results basically every week. Uh, at that point, I just sort of. You know, put my head down. Stuck to the the plan, and I pushed out. We never ended up revising those sort of functions, uh, and we pushed back. We pushed out the result. Our clients were still satisfied with it, which is fine. I just thought it was, uh, it was an opportunity for. For a better product there.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSure, I mean, what was the? Improvements to the customer outcome that you expected to get, right? Yeah, so? Um,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nIt's more of a, so the way that our loss function was defined, which was relevant for comparing these two metrics. These essentially, what we're saying is, whichever metric is better. Uh, whichever performs better on this metric. Is, we're claiming is the better algorithm right, and\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThe way\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThat these normalization. This last function was sort of computed, was it was computed using post normalization when using normalization constants that we had pre-computed from, essentially, a set of a sample of a certain number of task runs to get a range, right? So, these were like random decimals, uh?\n\nWe briefly explained our process for generating them in the paper, but we would just set these points out and then. Just say, hey, these are. These are the constants, right? So I really thought that that. Made that sort of lack Clarity, and it took away from our claim that, hey, if it passes, if an algorithm performs better on this Benchmark on this, uh, sorry, optimization metric, it really is the better function, because if it's not like, you know, super clear to understand. I was, I felt that the people who our customers would be presenting our report to to convince them of, you know, the superiority or the? Use case. They would have trouble getting that by them because it wasn't very. Clear. Uh, so I, I was, I was, like, hey, on my code, uh, or like, I have this idea for simple fix? I'm sure it could be fixed on the other on the DRL side as well, and we can have like a, you know, a well-defined function that is defined in terms of non-normalized values, so we don't need all of these random terms. But yeah, I I just? Yeah, so I received sort of pushback and\n\n[Speaker 4]\nEssentially pushing for.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nIt didn't take deadlines for it. Things that were not super in my in the eyes of my teammates, not super relevant.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThat makes sense, and so. Dee, would you still push for them today?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm. I would. Maybe I would push that would maybe just bring up the idea and under the understanding that everyone is sort of under tight deadlines. I think I would stop if. You know at the point that my teammate sort of clarified, uh, their situation, so why, uh, this wasn't a good idea? Yeah, did\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYou talk to the people that had to actually go and explain it to the customers?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm, yeah, they sort of mentioned that. They would prefer. If that was? If that wasn't the case, I didn't. I I mentioned this at a time that was earlier on in the project again. Had limited access to these collaborators, so I wasn't asking them this question every single week, and that sort of where I both. I got for where I sort of cemented that idea that I ended up pushing for it a bit further. I'm not sure how exactly relevant it was for them, because at that point in Project, we weren't sort of splitting hairs between, uh. Which features we can. We can actually fit into our report, in which features we have to toss, which is sort of the situation we got in. Towards the end of the quarter.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCool!\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll, right. Well, I think.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThat is all of my questions. Um, do you have any questions for me?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOh yeah, so you said, I mean? You're a senior software engineer, right? You start as an sd1 at Amazon,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nStarted as an intern. Oh,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nDid you move to some internet sd1 or directly?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, so you so the way the internships work is you intern over the summer and then you? You can come back after your. Uh, you know, year of college as an sd1?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOh, I see. So, if you, if you've been in sd1, what do you think? Things that you want to like, what do? What are the things that successful sd1s do? Uh, to succeed in that role, and what are the pitfalls, uh, common pitfalls that people fall into in that rule, um?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, what is? The job expectations of an sde one are are definitely the important thing to look at, right? So an sde one is, as I like to explain, it is basically just a full-time intern. Um, it's essentially where we bring in developers to give them a longer chance to prove that they can grow into productive. Engineers, and so being a productive engineer means multiple different things, does it? It means that you are able to complete your job with minimal oversight from others, right? So, we, we kind of expect, um. Nsd, you want to need a lot of guidance. But every ste one is judged based off of the ability to grow into an sde2, right, and so as an sd1, we expect you to be able to complete tasks that are well defined, but we also expect you to be able to. Figure out the gaps. Tasks that maybe aren't as well defined, right. Like, you need to be able to show that you have critical thinking skills throughout the entire software architecture chain to make sure that you can get you know. You can take ambiguous more and more ambiguous problems as you go and turn them into concrete Solutions. Additionally, it's a lot of. How much?\n\nCorrection. Do you need right? So, a lot of SCU ones are. The writing code that's maybe not perfect. Maybe the writing code that's too perfect, but? Doesn't actually work for the business, right? Like, where, where are you actually prioritizing your time? Right is, is kind of very important, and then obviously just operational. Like, it's something that you're not really. Exposed to when you are a not in Industry, kind of the operations of maintaining large-scale systems that are currently operating, and so being on call and being able to handle yourself are very important.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh, and what about the pitfalls? So,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nExplain what you mean by pitfalls of being an SD one.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhat are common things that cause people to, uh, in an sd1 rule, not either, not progress to sd2 or just be leave the company?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCommonly, it is a failure to grow, um, things. I often see from sdu ones that, um, are not successful, is they do not under. They don't make the transition to understanding that, um. The work that you provide needs to be ambiguous, and you need to have high standards for ambiguous work, right? It's not necessarily that, okay, I need to get something done. It's, I need to get something done right. I don't need to be told what to do. I should understand what to do properly. A lot of it is,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nFailure to grow to understand the changing requirements of software systems and that they serve the business, not necessarily. Um, being a code purist, right, like the end of the day, like we may or may not make changes based off of timelines and the things that we would need to get done in order to continue to make money. Um,\n\n[Speaker 3]\nYeah, and so it's\n\n[Speaker 2]\nA lot of. Usually, it's a mental shift. The the coding bar to get into Amazon is fine, like, whatever, as long as you can code, I really don't care. It's the ability to understand and work with others, um. And know that the business is, you're here to serve the business. It's kind of the the major downfall I see from people.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nObviously, you have to\n\n[Speaker 2]\nBe able to code, but like, if if you can't code, I can't fix that for you. Um, yeah, it's a\n\n[Speaker 1]\nLot\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOf the soft skills that really prevent people from getting from one to two. If it's not just coding?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm, yeah, I just had a question from your response. It was, uh, what do you mean by high standards for ambiguous code, like our ambiguous deliverables, um?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, let's say I am building a piece of software. I need an API to do something. If you are building me an API that just does what I need it to do, but you don't consider the fact that it might grow in the future. Right, like, did you hard code in a bunch of stuff that gets it working now, but causes Tech debt in the future? Right, like, do you not understand the the wins the way the winds are blowing? So, like, can you look forward like three to six months to understand the code changes. We're gonna have to make then so that the stuff that you make now isn't going to. Give us downtime or outages or additional, you know? Development work that needs to be done in the future in order to undo some of the stuff you just did.\n\nNot\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSure?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm. All right. Can I got one more question for you if you don't mind, uh? Is your favorite and least favorite part about the work culture at Amazon?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nFavorite and least favorite. Amazon, the I think one of my favorite things about Amazon is it's kind of a. You can choose your own destiny. Kind of company. If you put in a lot of work and a lot of effort, you can see yourself, you know. Rise through the ranks. You can kind of find Opportunities. That you don't necessarily need to be given by your manager. You can go and talk to leaders to say this is something we should be doing. Make a case for it. And then, you know, make it happen. It is perfectly reasonable thing to happen here, which I don't think is often appreciated at other companies. Um, on the other side of that. Uh, one of my least favorite things about Amazon, it's. It's a large company, and so you have to deal with a lot of large company crap where you know there you have. You don't always have control, and your immediate leadership doesn't always have control over different parts of you know what your wife is like at Amazon, right? Like, we don't necessarily control RTO. So, like, we go back to the office five days a week, right? I'm sure everyone does that. Um, many people would prefer. We stayed at three three days a week, or we just were fully remote, but? Larger company. You don't really have access to some of the decision makers for those types of things. Right?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nGotcha. Overall,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI enjoy working here.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOh, that's good to hear.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSupposed we have a bit of time remaining for? Like, I said, we, we don't have to take up the full amount of time this. This interview doesn't always take up the full hour. Yeah,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI mean, I guess I could ask you,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, one more thing. Well,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI'm just curious about, uh. So, when what was the last major failure that uh happened at, like either either something you were directly responsible for or just the team that you were on. And what sort of caused it and what could have prevented it? So? That.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAn interesting question because my current team doesn't really own anything. Um, my team kind of writes recommendations and templates, and builds out libraries and software that's not actually running Production Services. And so. Have not really had serious outages for code that we owned, and it's, I've been on this team for like two years, so it's kind of. It's a semi-difficult question to answer. I've been on some very serious, um. Calls before, but? Um, I can't necessarily answer that. Oh yeah, yeah, I mean, that's true. All right. Yeah, I think, uh, I think those are all the questions I have for you. Cool. All, right? Well, hey, I think. You have a break after this. If I'm correct, I\n\n[Speaker 1]\nDo so. Yeah, all right. Well, good luck in your next interview. Thank\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYou! Nice meeting! You hope to, uh, work together in the future all right, bye!","numLines":471,"startLine":1,"totalLines":471}}}

Oh yeah. Uh, just a little bit. Nah, you're good. All right, so. Let's go ahead and get started. So the way that this interview is going to work? It's probably a little different than your other interviews. Um, we're not going to have any coding questions. Uh, it's just going to be a conversation between you and me. Um, I'm going to ask you, you know, a few questions about your past, um, just to get to know you a little bit better? Um, yeah, the the interview doesn't usually take the full hour. So don't like be concerned if it ends early. Um. But let's go ahead, and uh. Get started with introductions so. Go ahead and tell me all about yourself. Well, I'm Josh, and um.\n    26→\n    27→[Speaker 1]\n    28→As of May 2025, I'm a graduate of Washington State University where I earn my bachelor's of Science in computer science, alongside a minor in mathematics. Most recently, I worked at hops Diner. Where I helped transform. Manual tour intake. Process into a web app. So, in an effort to reduce manual overhead and human error. They ended up using this application during their peak season, where they see the most number of guests and. They ended up hiring me as an intern to continue maintaining the application. Uh, before that experience. I was at. Our University. Agtech Research Institute AG Aid. And it was at hagg Aid where I designed. A simple data pre-processing pipelines. Um, using Apache spark. And we use the data. Did we use the data that I clean to ultimately predict rainfall levels and better allocate Water Resources for local farmers and governments? Uh, yeah, that's me.\n    29→\n    30→[Speaker 2]\n    31→Cool, sorry. Apparently things are on fire.\n    32→\n    33→[Speaker 1]\n    34→Telling people\n    35→\n    36→[Speaker 2]\n    37→That I am busy. And. Pausing all these notifications so? Leave me alone, all right. All right, everything's been on fire the past couple days. It's been fun all right, so a little bit about me. My name is Ben. Uh, I've been a. Software developer at Amazon for about eight years now. Um, yeah. Yeah, I started as an intern, uh, and then came in as Nesty one and worked my way up to senior engineer. Um. Been it a few different places of the company. Um, I started out in. As an intern, I started out in AWS, working on the console homepage team. And then my career kind of progressed into Alexa Communications, you know, working on calling between different Alexa devices, phones, messaging, Etc? Then over into prime air, where I built out a lot of the Drone delivery. Foundational software systems. Oh wow, yeah. And then, I moved over to asbx, uh, or better known as Builder tools, where I kind of helped Define the. Patterns that folks should be using when they are building web services at Amazon. So, I own kind of like the web service experience.\n    38→\n    39→[Speaker 1]\n    40→Wow, yeah.\n    41→\n    42→[Speaker 2]\n    43→So? We're gonna head and Jump Right In. Can you tell me about a problem you've had to solve that required in-depth thought and Analysis?\n    44→\n    45→Yeah, sure.\n    46→\n    47→[Speaker 1]\n    48→Could I have a second to think of a good example? Yeah, sure.\n    49→\n    50→I'm trying to decide between two and. No worries.\n    51→\n    52→[Speaker 2]\n    53→We're not in any rush.\n    54→\n    55→[Speaker 1]\n    56→Okay. Um, yeah, I think I've I've got one. So? In my junior year of college, I was taking an introduction to machine learning course, and it was the first taste of machine learning that I had ever had. And so, of course, like that's a big challenge in and of itself. For our term project, I have decided to partner up with one of my friends who was in his PhD program for. A cross-disciplinary between bioinformatics and computer science, so I was already like needy, but now I'm like waist deep and in information that I pretty much have no domain knowledge in. And. Um, what we were working on was the prediction of? Diffusion rates in. Hydrogel mesh. Environment so basically like, um, a little squishy Band-Aid thing with a lattice structure inside of it, and you basically put a drug solution in there, and you want to see, like, how long it takes for it to actually enter like the the skin, like the application?\n    57→\n    58→And so I knew nothing about. I knew very little about machine learning and even less about the. The hydrogel mesh systems and drug diffusivity. So, in this semester, I basically spent. The large half of the? The term learning about the the fundamentals.\n    59→\n    60→[Speaker 2]\n    61→To\n    62→\n    63→[Speaker 1]\n    64→Machine learning and then.\n    65→\n    66→Further expanded upon that by learning how to apply it to like. A field in which I had no experience. Thankfully, my my partner, he he, did this kind of work, like day in, day out, so he was able to explain it to me, however. In the process of it.\n    67→\n    68→I was forced to learn. Not\n    69→\n    70→[Speaker 2]\n    71→Only how\n    72→\n    73→[Speaker 1]\n    74→To. Clean the data and also. How to? Use predictive modeling to save time and energy on, like, sorry, let me let me rephrase that a little bit, and instead of like, actually, manually running like the the wet lab tests, which would take like? Inconceivable amount of time and resources and effort. We used, um, like different regression analysis techniques to essentially. Model out the diffusivity of. These Solutions through the hydrogel mesh system instead, and so.\n    75→\n    76→[Speaker 2]\n    77→Of course, like\n    78→\n    79→[Speaker 1]\n    80→I had the help of um cat gpt and my my lab partner to help guide me through this process. However, I was in completely foreign territory and. What I had to do personally? Was? Find the original data sets of like the the density of the different molecules.\n    81→\n    82→[Speaker 2]\n    83→Um,\n    84→\n    85→[Speaker 1]\n    86→Or the drugs in this case. And\n    87→\n    88→[Speaker 2]\n    89→Then\n    90→\n    91→[Speaker 1]\n    92→Figure out. Like, which sort of solutions? What, what sort of like, um? Like, like, saline solutions to like? Uh, dilute these drugs to the point where they were actually administerable. And so I would I had to do research on?\n    93→\n    94→[Speaker 2]\n    95→What,\n    96→\n    97→[Speaker 1]\n    98→What kind of um? Sorry, the the concentration of the solution. That'd be safe for, like humans, to?\n    99→\n   100→Have in their system and then taking these parameters. I would then have to plug that in to the um. The the regression analysis functions that? We had constructed and ensure that the. The results that we found were within the bounds of what was considered safe for humans and then ultimately.\n   101→\n   102→In addition to this, like, there was also the variable that, um. Like, there's a different different densities of like the hydrogel mesh lattice structures, and\n   103→\n   104→[Speaker 2]\n   105→So\n   106→\n   107→[Speaker 1]\n   108→We ended up cutting out that portion because it just got too complicated for a single term project. So, so we narrowed down the scope and focused on the solution itself and the diffusivity, and so. Modeling of the solutions and the diffusivity in. Controlled, um, lattice structure. We, um, we were able to generate a long list of different chemical compounds and their diffusivity, which my partner was then able to utilize in his lab to actually. Produce, like real medical applicators for real humans.\n   109→\n   110→[Speaker 2]\n   111→So it was actually used to create real products after the fact.\n   112→\n   113→[Speaker 1]\n   114→Right, right? Like? Our our data was actually utilized to help others basically like help those in need.\n   115→\n   116→[Speaker 2]\n   117→That's very cool. It sounds like. The majority. Of the learning, so it sounds like it was two kind of main pieces like you didn't really understand machine learning all that much because it was. You know your first time kind of doing a foray into it, but also you didn't understand the thing that you were going to be doing machine learning on because obviously like? Yes, you're not a gotta. I don't even remember what profession that was, yeah.\n   118→\n   119→[Speaker 1]\n   120→Um.\n   121→\n   122→[Speaker 2]\n   123→So that makes sense. So you were kind of like in stuck in between, you know, these two worlds of trying to need to understand so? How did you know you were able to focus on? Like, how are you able to figure out what you needed to focus on? In order to actually resolve the problems.\n   124→\n   125→[Speaker 1]\n   126→Um, so? Essentially, um? The way in which I determine, like, what my like primary focus was was? I, I thought about, like, within the scope of what I can do as an individual, and like with my domain knowledge. Um. I, I wanted to be able to contribute to, like what my partner was doing, right? I didn't want him to just carry the entire project by himself, and so. I, I took it upon myself to. To look into like? What part of this problem can I actually like, learn, and tackle by myself, which would be like? The. The basically the concentration, like learning about how, how concentrated of certain solutions? Humans can actually like handle, right? The concentration of the drug or the medicine, because you know, like, if if the drug is too concentrated, like the medicine can become poison? And so. Using this information, I made it. I made that my primary focus for the project and. I was able to do research through through various Publications and studies and consolidate all of that information into a data set that was. Um, very, very clear and concise. It was just the the compound. The chemical compound, and then like the concentration of that compound, which was, uh, like usable or pragmatic, and so then we had that to like. Set as a Target or like a bar. Like, anything above that concentration would be like bad data and like, like we, we don't want that so. From my work that I I did to assist in this, um project, like we were able to eliminate a lot of excess noisy data and\n   127→\n   128→[Speaker 2]\n   129→Ultimately provide\n   130→\n   131→[Speaker 1]\n   132→Cleaner results that were safe for human usage.\n   133→\n   134→[Speaker 2]\n   135→So? Yo, you're gonna have to excuse me because my my expertise is definitely also not in machine learning.\n   136→\n   137→[Speaker 1]\n   138→Um, so\n   139→\n   140→[Speaker 2]\n   141→Was the what was the actual output of this? Was it just good data? So?\n   142→\n   143→Was the outcome literally just data on what was acceptable? Like what the best values were like? Where were you trying to min max?\n   144→\n   145→[Speaker 1]\n   146→Um, right, so? Like, so it's kind of like a two-step,\n   147→\n   148→[Speaker 2]\n   149→Okay thing\n   150→\n   151→[Speaker 1]\n   152→Here. So, ultimately, we want to know, like? How fast can our solution diffuse through the applicator, right? But our solution also has to be like of a certain concentration.\n   153→\n   154→[Speaker 2]\n   155→In order\n   156→\n   157→[Speaker 1]\n   158→To actually be usable, right? And so, I was responsible for figuring out the exact concentration that was acceptable.\n   159→\n   160→[Speaker 2]\n   161→To actually\n   162→\n   163→[Speaker 1]\n   164→Put inside of the applicator.\n   165→\n   166→[Speaker 2]\n   167→So the output was like a single value, not necessarily like a giant data set.\n   168→\n   169→[Speaker 1]\n   170→Right. It was like a single value for for, like, it was like an upper bound for, like each individual chemical compound. So, so we ran like a bunch of different chemical compounds,\n   171→\n   172→[Speaker 2]\n   173→So you basically created a function that we allowed you to. Insert a chemical and then figure out on the other side what the maximum was and the speed. It would go through the applicator and whatnot, right? Pretty much. And you use machine learning in order to like min max, the. The acceptable acceptability of each chemical, okay?\n   174→\n   175→[Speaker 1]\n   176→Right.\n   177→\n   178→[Speaker 2]\n   179→Okay, sorry. I'm like, I said, I'm trying to learn machine learning, so don't you did a great job explaining\n   180→\n   181→[Speaker 1]\n   182→For me. It's still like a thinking back to it is pretty pretty complicated and like. Like the the bioinformatics side of that is still pretty foreign to me.\n   183→\n   184→[Speaker 2]\n   185→All right, my family does that stuff. So, believe me, I understand. Okay, so then. The outcome that you had. You said that there was a? Um, it was actually used in. Real world scenarios in order to create products to help people. What? What were the like, what was the ACT like? If you had to explain this to someone who doesn't understand any of it like me? What like, was there a specific like chemical compound that was actually useful? Like, if you had to tell people what you enabled, what would it be?\n   186→\n   187→[Speaker 1]\n   188→Sorry, there's there's some Sirens blaring. Do you mind if I close the window real quick? Oh\n   189→\n   190→[Speaker 2]\n   191→Yeah, go for it. Go for it. Sorry.\n   192→\n   193→[Speaker 1]\n   194→And then I, I hate to be that guy, but cuz you repeat the question. Oh\n   195→\n   196→[Speaker 2]\n   197→No, you're absolutely fine. So, I'm just trying to figure out like if I was to explain to somebody else, like I was to explain. What it is that you did? Would I say that you enabled some drug to go to market? Would it be that you enabled some? You gave a function to Industries so that they could. You know, evaluate chemicals, like, how would you say that? So, so, what\n   198→\n   199→[Speaker 1]\n   200→We enabled was basically the? Like, well, two, two primary things is first. We cut down massively on, like, raw testing time.\n   201→\n   202→[Speaker 2]\n   203→Had\n   204→\n   205→[Speaker 1]\n   206→We actually gone into the lab and like injected the hydrogel mesh and then sat there and watched it and recorded it for, like, all these hundreds, if not thousands of different compounds that would have taken a a huge amount of time and human resource. And so, with what we did, we essentially were able to derive these diffusivity rates.\n   207→\n   208→Without that like wet lab process? And then. Uh, the other thing we did, was we? We derived these numbers at a a safe level, like?\n   209→\n   210→In the specifically in the condition of or in the in the setting of the hydrogel mesh. Like, because like the whole idea behind this hydrogel matching applicator is it's like a Band-Aid, basically, and in in areas where there's not that many nurses where they don't have like the technique to actually give you the jab. You would just apply one of these micro needle mesh.\n   211→\n   212→Apply the medicine at the proper rate to like give you the proper dose without any kind of like medical supervision\n   213→\n   214→[Speaker 2]\n   215→At the right concentration, and all that, okay, right? At the\n   216→\n   217→[Speaker 1]\n   218→Right concentration at a safe level?\n   219→\n   220→[Speaker 2]\n   221→That makes sense.\n   222→\n   223→[Speaker 1]\n   224→Okay. Cool. That\n   225→\n   226→[Speaker 2]\n   227→Makes sense to me. Thank you for that. All right, let's move on. No, no, no, I. Inherently confusing subject, but you've managed to explain it to me well enough that I feel like I can explain it, which is good job. Thank you. Um. So, next question? Uh, can you tell me about a time?\n   228→\n   229→Can you tell me about a problem you had that required? In-Depth thought and Analysis.\n   230→\n   231→Uh, yeah, sure,\n   232→\n   233→[Speaker 1]\n   234→Um?\n   235→\n   236→And just think about that one for a second.\n   237→\n   238→So, I'm thinking of an example. Right now, it is from. My internship at AG Aid, which is our University's AG Tech Institute and. This was back in 2022. And at the time I had never worked with large data sets before just small SQL stuff like, you know, like a phone book directory, and that was the extent of. Work with databases. And.\n   239→\n   240→[Speaker 2]\n   241→Um,\n   242→\n   243→[Speaker 1]\n   244→At AG Aid, we were working on an initiative called ice spark, which sought. Uh, predict. Ice melt or given ice melt levels and various Geo. Initial data from satellites. We would want to predict, like rainfall, patterns for water allocation.\n   245→\n   246→[Speaker 2]\n   247→Okay.\n   248→\n   249→[Speaker 1]\n   250→So, so that way, like, you know, the farmers and the local government could make better informed decisions on how much water to actually like pump into the land? That makes sense for context. Sorry for context, uh? Our County was the and still is the largest grain producing county in the world. It's.\n   251→\n   252→[Speaker 2]\n   253→Is this King County?\n   254→\n   255→[Speaker 1]\n   256→No, it was, um, Palouse, or how was it called Whitman County? Okay?\n   257→\n   258→[Speaker 2]\n   259→Somewhere in Washington,\n   260→\n   261→[Speaker 1]\n   262→Washington State University.\n   263→\n   264→[Speaker 2]\n   265→Oh, oh, oh, sorry, I was thinking of you dub.\n   266→\n   267→[Speaker 1]\n   268→Yeah, there's endless wheat feels like everywhere you look. Basically,\n   269→\n   270→[Speaker 3]\n   271→I've never made it out there to believe it or not.\n   272→\n   273→[Speaker 1]\n   274→I've\n   275→\n   276→[Speaker 3]\n   277→Never made it out there, believe it or not.\n   278→\n   279→[Speaker 1]\n   280→Uh, you're not missing out on much. Yeah.\n   281→\n   282→[Speaker 2]\n   283→Anyway.\n   284→\n   285→[Speaker 1]\n   286→Um. But anyways, uh, so? Part of my job was collecting the satellite data. Um, from various different organizations such as NASA and eu's version, which is Copernicus. And the thing is, in order to make accurate predictions, you want to draw data from. Several months, if not years back, and these satellites are constantly like, uh, collecting data as they, you know, orbit, and so what you you end up with is millions of lines of just? Sensible.\n   287→\n   288→[Speaker 2]\n   289→Data.\n   290→\n   291→[Speaker 1]\n   292→Like all sorts of random stuff, um. And. Having never worked with data on such a scale before, you know, my initial thought was, yeah. Like, let's go with SQL and like plug it in, but it's very quickly. I found out SQL was not fast enough and not capable of handling such amounts of data and. Yeah, I. I went online and I did some research, I said, like. I looked into it, and I was like, how can I speed up this process? And how can I like make this actually usable? And so? I stumbled upon Apache spark, and so I learned Spark and I learned about the data frames. And then using. A tutorial that I found online. I applied the, it was actually a Jupiter notebook that someone had set up entire years. And they were. They were processing a different data set, but I essentially took their skeleton. And then I was able to. Feed it. My CSV files, my my data, that I have collected from the. Satellites through a wet scraper and? Using spark, I was able to. Actually store all of the fields that I was interested in and speed up retrieval times upwards of 10x. Um. Like, had we gone the traditional route and utilized a sequel? It's, it's hard to imagine how long it would have taken to retrieve and process all of that data.\n   293→\n   294→Um. And then. With this sped up. Retrieval and access, along with the processing power. We we saved a ton of time and computational resource. Uh, which ultimately enabled us to make. Predictions about the the Water Resource to about, like the potential rainfall, and like, um, Water Resources that we might need.\n   295→\n   296→[Speaker 2]\n   297→Uh,\n   298→\n   299→[Speaker 1]\n   300→For, for our local farmers and and state government, to to make their informed decisions.\n   301→\n   302→[Speaker 2]\n   303→Okay. So?\n   304→\n   305→What are the pieces of that that you didn't really understand going in? Was it really like spark?\n   306→\n   307→[Speaker 1]\n   308→Right, it is primarily it was the spark. Which I had never worked with before and. Um. Also like the the scraping of the data from the satellites. I\n   309→\n   310→[Speaker 2]\n   311→Also like we\n   312→\n   313→[Speaker 1]\n   314→Had to write a parser for that, which was new to me. Yeah, so.\n   315→\n   316→[Speaker 2]\n   317→I am. I, I know, I've heard the word spark before.\n   318→\n   319→[Speaker 1]\n   320→So,\n   321→\n   322→[Speaker 2]\n   323→Can you explain to me what spark really does?\n   324→\n   325→[Speaker 1]\n   326→Yeah, so um. Spark basically. How do I put it?\n   327→\n   328→So, instead of. Like our traditional like sequel, which is just, you know, like? Fields, and then, like. The data members there. There are these data frames in spark.\n   329→\n   330→[Speaker 2]\n   331→That.\n   332→\n   333→[Speaker 1]\n   334→Essentially.\n   335→\n   336→Um, not\n   337→\n   338→[Speaker 2]\n   339→Sure exactly how he's like, so is spark a different type of database, or is it a tool for processing data? Yeah, it's.\n   340→\n   341→[Speaker 1]\n   342→From from my understanding. It's, um. It's, it's like both. Basically, it's like a framework. Okay.\n   343→\n   344→That that enables you to like? It speeds up like the um, the rate at which you can process huge amounts of data. Uh, it serves as like the database and the the operations. Uh, that happened. Or, like, when you're when you're Computing? Um, from your spark databases. It significantly faster than than if you were to query from like a SQL database.\n   345→\n   346→[Speaker 2]\n   347→So? Is it that mean it's like an ingestion so? But I'm trying to rationalize what spark is my mind, so? Is it a like an ingestion framework that then stores into a database for easy querying out like? All right. How do you interact with spark?\n   348→\n   349→[Speaker 1]\n   350→Um.\n   351→\n   352→Well. Yeah, kind of, it's like. The the way I interacted it. Well, at least in my experience, what we did, was we, we set up the the Jupiter notebook, and then\n   353→\n   354→[Speaker 2]\n   355→We called.\n   356→\n   357→[Speaker 1]\n   358→We made calls to spark to. Essentially like? Not only. Create the the data frames to store the the fields that we wanted. But also to, to be able to. Uh, retrieve, and and. Perform operations upon those those fields.\n   359→\n   360→I'm not sure if that quite answers your question, though. I\n   361→\n   362→[Speaker 2]\n   363→Think it's. I'm just trying to like. Understand kind of what spark does so, like, since you also had to learn what spark did, like, how did you go about learning about it?\n   364→\n   365→[Speaker 1]\n   366→Right, so? Um. Like it was a, it was a Loosely coupled internships, so essentially we, we just got a task and then. We, we were supposed to figure it out on our own. So, I went online and then. I, I went to a couple tutorials, and then I found a tutorial that was doing essentially the same thing that I wanted to achieve, which was. Basically store and be able to access. Big Data. Like more than I'd used before, like by a huge margin, and so. Um, the way they set it up is. And the way I had set it up was.\n   367→\n   368→Basically. We, we had these CSV files. That contain the raw data. And then, using the the data frames in spark. We were able to. Basically like selectively. Draw out the. The specific geospatial data that we were interested in. Like, filter out the noise.\n   369→\n   370→[Speaker 2]\n   371→One second, my dog is barking, and I'm not. I can't hear you very well. Oh sorry.\n   372→\n   373→[Speaker 4]\n   374→Boopy!\n   375→\n   376→Come inside.\n   377→\n   378→All right, hold\n   379→\n   380→[Speaker 2]\n   381→Up.\n   382→\n   383→So sorry about that. I have sequestered him. He will behave. All right, sorry, go on.\n   384→\n   385→[Speaker 1]\n   386→Yeah, so where was I, um?\n   387→\n   388→[Speaker 2]\n   389→You're explaining to me how you were learning spark.\n   390→\n   391→[Speaker 1]\n   392→Right, right? So, um, the the way spark works is like? Chunks up your data into, like? Data frames.\n   393→\n   394→[Speaker 2]\n   395→And then.\n   396→\n   397→[Speaker 1]\n   398→Um. It performs like computational tasks. On these. Individual data frames. Um, instead of just going through, like a single, a singular like massive data set and just one by one. And, uh, so this? It's like, um, it's like, distributed, uh? Across these data frames like the computations are the students across the data frames in a sense. Um, which enables for faster. Run time and processing.\n   399→\n   400→[Speaker 2]\n   401→Okay.\n   402→\n   403→[Speaker 1]\n   404→From from my understanding. Could be like, slightly off. No,\n   405→\n   406→[Speaker 2]\n   407→It's fine. So, like, what is a, what is a data frame really? Like, what's the difference between a data frame and a like? You know nosql database like column? Or sorry row?\n   408→\n   409→[Speaker 1]\n   410→Um.\n   411→\n   412→I don't have too much experience in no sequel, but I mean,\n   413→\n   414→[Speaker 2]\n   415→Yeah, I mean, it's just like a hashment. No, sequel's just a hash map. Like, because, yeah.\n   416→\n   417→[Speaker 1]\n   418→I think the the key differentiator. Is that? With like a hash map or no sequel, um? It's just one continuous. Chunk of data. But they're just, you know. Like, if you want to go through it, you have to go top to bottom.\n   419→\n   420→[Speaker 2]\n   421→Okay.\n   422→\n   423→[Speaker 1]\n   424→Um. And then. With spark, and with these data frames.\n   425→\n   426→The the computational load is distributed. Into into these data frames for, like, individual processing, and then you, you take all of them, and then you. You like, join the the data, the data frames together. Once, once you've like performed your computations. It results in an overall faster. Like runtime and reduced individual like? What do you call it? Computational.\n   427→\n   428→It reduces the necessity for, like, computational resources online, a single host.\n   429→\n   430→[Speaker 2]\n   431→So? Let me see. Let me see if I can rephrase this, help me understand so the frames. Or so in a in a hash man, right? I have a key, which then has an object on the other side, which has all the value I have values I have in it, right? And so, if I want to look it up, I have to look by the key, or if I want to look at everything I have to do a full scan of the database and process each element individually. But it sounds like we're just saying, with spark, is it? It chunks related items together. So, like, if it's a Time series, it'll chunk everything that happened at, you know, the one minute Mark the two minute Mark the three minute Mark together so that you can better distribute them for processing since they're more related. Does that? Is that kind of right?\n   432→\n   433→[Speaker 1]\n   434→Right, I think that's. Let me think about that for a second.\n   435→\n   436→[Speaker 2]\n   437→I'm using a bit of an example. I'm just trying to understand exactly how the data frames work.\n   438→\n   439→[Speaker 1]\n   440→Yeah, um. Uh, it's been a couple years, so I'm not like 100 on it. Yeah, I'm sure.\n   441→\n   442→[Speaker 2]\n   443→No, it's okay.\n   444→\n   445→Like I, I'm\n   446→\n   447→[Speaker 1]\n   448→Pretty sure that's the. That's like the fundamental idea behind it.\n   449→\n   450→[Speaker 2]\n   451→So, then you, you said, you had to learn this for an internship, right? Right? How did your team help teach you about how to use spark since I assumed spark was already there when you? Got there, or at least it was, like, it sounds. It sounded like it was something that was predefined that you were going to be using.\n   452→\n   453→[Speaker 1]\n   454→Yeah, um, we. Is kind of like a weird case, but we actually didn't have much of a team. So, the way AG Aid set up their internships was? You had like a mentor? And then some. Some initiatives had teams and then. Uh, my initiative was just me and my mentor, but my mentor went off to China for two months and.\n   455→\n   456→Essentially offline, so I did almost all of my learning just independently online. Okay.\n   457→\n   458→[Speaker 2]\n   459→That must have been annoying.\n   460→\n   461→[Speaker 1]\n   462→It. It was definitely far from ideal, but. It's still like an experience.\n   463→\n   464→[Speaker 5]\n   465→Oh, of course, of course. Glad I\n   466→\n   467→[Speaker 1]\n   468→Got to do it.\n   469→\n   470→[Speaker 2]\n   471→All right. So, what? Let's go to. The\n   472→\n   473→[Speaker 5]\n   474→Next question here.\n   475→\n   476→[Speaker 2]\n   477→So? Um.\n   478→\n   479→Can you give me an example of a? Tough or a critical piece of feedback that you've received?\n   480→\n   481→[Speaker 1]\n   482→Yeah, sure, um. So, in my project with hopsteiner? The the facility tour intake? Application that we were building. For the first couple of months. We had been building the application in flutter. Um, because we were under the impression that we had to deploy to iOS and to web. And so we had heard that flutter was a good framework for. That kind of work. Um. However, like two or three months into our work into our progress. Like, we had already set up the basics. Um, we had a meeting with one of the higher ups at hopsteiner, and we were informed that. Like what we were doing? Uh, we, we would have to scrap it and start over in Blazer, because that's what. Existing systems were built on. And that they were now concerned with integrating with those existing systems more than like the like, the cross, or the. Uh, the multi-platform was now a secondary concern, and that integrating with the existing Erp and CRM systems, which, like the the Microsoft. Ecosystem was now more important, and so, like, upon hearing this news, we we were all like. You know, like, dumbfounded, for a second, like we had just worked so hard on this for, like the past two or three months, and so? Um. Like our first thought, of course, wasn't. Wasn't great, but. We knew, like, you know, at the end of the day, we're building this for them and?\n   483→\n   484→Like making sure that it needs their requirements. And ensuring that, like, they get what they need, comes first so. Uh, after that meeting, we got together as a group after the meeting with the customer. We got together as a group and. Um, like, as a team and we, we had a discussion about it.\n   485→\n   486→We. Basically like we did some preliminary research into.net and and thought about how challenging it would be to refactor all of our code and just basically restart in in.net. Although it was no easy task, it wasn't like, Easy by any means. However, like we did not have any other real option at that time, like that's what the customer wants, then that's kind of what we have to do,\n   487→\n   488→[Speaker 2]\n   489→Right? Um.\n   490→\n   491→[Speaker 1]\n   492→And so, our next meeting we got back to to hopsteiner. And we're like, all right, like. We understand the request and like, we understand why it's important, like. As much as we would like to preserve our work for the past couple months, like we understand. Excuse me. That it's it's more important? That that it like fits in seamlessly with your existing Frameworks, and so we decided to go ahead and. Basically start over, at least on the front end. Switch to.net Blazer and build out from there. And. We had already gotten, so let me backtrack one second. Our application consisted of four main points, which was the login the. Uh, the Hop selection interface. And. Um, the, uh, the the calendar scheduling and the back end. So, we had set up the preliminary backend, which we were able to keep, and we had set in the login, which we had to completely scrap. And then we had some designs on figma for the other portions which still helped us guide the, uh, the development for? Portion of the build, and so we went ahead and. They said, you know, what? Like, whatever's in the past is in the past. Like, what matters now is like, we do what we can, under our new constraints and requirements. Um, so we went ahead and built out. As much as we could. Of the application. Before the end of the semester, we started in January the end of the semester was in May. However, their Harvest season was in August,\n   493→\n   494→[Speaker 2]\n   495→And so this\n   496→\n   497→[Speaker 1]\n   498→Three-Month period after school ended. Was critical for them. In terms of like their business operations. But we no longer technically had any obligation to. Keep working. But since we had made that big mistake early on,\n   499→\n   500→[Speaker 2]\n   501→We decided that\n   502→\n   503→[Speaker 1]\n   504→You know what, like, whoever is available this summer. Whoever has the time? Like, let's just get together and right our wrongs. And. We were able to develop an MVP that was actually utilized during harvest season. Um, we got real user feedback through. You know, those tours where, where people actually utilize this MVP to, to select their hops and to schedule their tours? Um, as a result, our customer pop Steiner. They were able to cut back on the the manual labor and effort for. That season, and they they renewed the. The contract with Washington State University, and then they also took me in as an intern to continue working on. Um, and I think. Had we been stubborn about flutter early on, then that could have definitely taken a completely different direction?\n   505→\n   506→[Speaker 2]\n   507→That makes sense. All right, so it sounds like you, you guys basically. Took the feedback as is expected, but did the right thing in the end, which I think is a good story.\n   508→\n   509→[Speaker 1]\n   510→Yeah, but I think like looking back on it.\n   511→\n   512→We probably should have spent more time like in those first couple of weeks or first month or so, like ensuring that, like, our initial trajectory, was the trajectory that we. Would continue to work towards instead of just okay. Like, let's, let's start working and making something like.\n   513→\n   514→[Speaker 2]\n   515→It's a valuable lesson. Everyone learns.\n   516→\n   517→[Speaker 1]\n   518→Cool!\n   519→\n   520→[Speaker 2]\n   521→All right. Well, that is all of the questions that I have, uh, do you have any questions for me? Uh.\n   522→\n   523→[Speaker 1]\n   524→Yeah, um. So, you mentioned that you were in the internal tools? Team, right? And so I was wondering, like? Perhaps, what? What sort of like, uh? What, what is that kind of entail?\n   525→\n   526→[Speaker 2]\n   527→Well, internal tooling is a very broad subject, especially in a company like Amazon that's been around. Since before many development tools existed. Amazon built, uh. So, so an example of some of the larger things that we own? Um.\n   528→\n   529→Basically built the preliminary. Technology that if you know, like npm? Or you know of like cargo? Uh, we have something called Brazil. Um, which we built before package management really exists. It was, it was really, just like Maven, um, and so we built something that was more, um. A little bit more strict. They could scale to solve Amazon's needs as like a crazy large company with a bunch of dependency update stuff because Amazon does not operate under a monorepo, so it gets a little bit hairy. Other one that we own is something called Apollo, which is a deployment mechanism so. Similar to not really Jenkins. Um, it's a system that. Yeah, maybe, maybe, like, salt. It. It basically manages the deployment of executables onto physical hosts. So, like, if I own a host, I have Apollo create like a sub environment on it, and it's responsible for starting up the. Executable, however, that may work doing some monitoring on it and then gracefully taking it down, doing some load shedding load shifting. You know, it's been expanded to support a lot of different use cases over the years. But there's also. You know, our internal version of something like Jenkins, that also didn't exist back in the day. Uh, so it's a lot of a lot of that. Niche tools, like our ticketing systems, so we don't use jero. We have our own internal stuff that's built specifically for Amazon's needs, right? So there's. It's a very wide variety of things that Builder tool zones.\n   530→\n   531→[Speaker 1]\n   532→I see, and then. I can't even imagine how complicated something like Brazil must, because just npm like. I mean, even that has, like, seemingly endless, like calls and. The resources, and like packages that it needs to call on and then the hierarchy of those\n   533→\n   534→[Speaker 2]\n   535→Packages, like. Brazil is definitely one of the more complicated things that we own because it doesn't make it, doesn't make any sense to me. There's a lot of people that unders. There's some people that understand it, and I'm just like, okay. Like you, you know, better than me. But. Yeah.\n   536→\n   537→[Speaker 1]\n   538→Uh, another thing I wanted to know was.\n   539→\n   540→What are? What are like some of the biggest challenges you find yourself facing, like day-to-day working at Amazon?\n   541→\n   542→[Speaker 2]\n   543→Um. I can tell you, but I don't think that the challenges that I face are going to be the challenges that you would face as a new hire. Um, most of my challenges are about prioritization working across orgs. Um, trying to make sure we. It's like setting our sites in the correct direction. Um, kind of thinking about the longer multi-year plans rather than actual work that needs to get done right now. I\n   544→\n   545→[Speaker 1]\n   546→See.\n   547→\n   548→[Speaker 2]\n   549→Yeah, yeah, that's probably Beyond my scope, uh, at least for a while, probably yeah.\n   550→\n   551→[Speaker 1]\n   552→And then, I guess what are. What are some of the things that you really enjoy about Amazon's culture? Like, I think it's really interesting how Amazon has like LPS.\n   553→\n   554→[Speaker 2]\n   555→I feel like\n   556→\n   557→[Speaker 1]\n   558→That's very different from a lot of companies where there's not really like a clear, defined bullet point, like. These are the things\n   559→\n   560→[Speaker 2]\n   561→We care about. It is, the LPS are interesting. We get a lot of people make fun of us because we use them in everyday conversations to kind of describe the things that we're doing to help give people on board. Um, a lot of the leadership principles that are at odds with each other, right. So, like? Insist on the highest standards and deliver results or to LPS that are easily at odds with each other, right? Because I can't always build the right thing while delivering quickly.\n   562→\n   563→[Speaker 1]\n   564→Right? So it's\n   565→\n   566→[Speaker 2]\n   567→All about, like balancing the LPS to come out with the right outcomes. And so it's interesting.\n   568→\n   569→[Speaker 1]\n   570→I guess that just comes down to like personal experience and judgment.\n   571→\n   572→[Speaker 2]\n   573→There is one of the leadership principles, which is right, a lot, be right, a lot. Um, that one is definitely more applicable towards like managers and upper leadership. We kind of. A good leader is always or is often right. And being right can be a combination of, you know, judgment calls. But using your judgment with data in order to improve your judgment over time, it helps show that you are, in fact, a good leader, right? So? It's all kind of a flywheel that works together.\n   574→\n   575→Yeah, I think I think the LP is really like stand out to me as like. Like, a really interesting facet of Amazon. It's definitely one that we harp on a lot for sure.\n   576→\n   577→Cool! I think that that was it for my questions. Thank you for your time. I really do appreciate it. Well, thank you so much.

How are you?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI'm good. Thank you.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nGive me just one second here. Um.\n\nJust putting together a? Place to take some notes.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nIt's fun doing\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThese back to back. Never had enough time. Awesome! I've been sweating earlier. Oh yeah. Uh, just a little bit. Nah, you're good. All right, so. Let's go ahead and get started. So the way that this interview is going to work? It's probably a little different than your other interviews. Um, we're not going to have any coding questions. Uh, it's just going to be a conversation between you and me. Um, I'm going to ask you, you know, a few questions about your past, um, just to get to know you a little bit better? Um, yeah, the the interview doesn't usually take the full hour. So don't like be concerned if it ends early. Um. But let's go ahead, and uh. Get started with introductions so. Go ahead and tell me all about yourself. Well, I'm Josh, and um.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAs of May 2025, I'm a graduate of Washington State University where I earn my bachelor's of Science in computer science, alongside a minor in mathematics. Most recently, I worked at hops Diner. Where I helped transform. Manual tour intake. Process into a web app. So, in an effort to reduce manual overhead and human error. They ended up using this application during their peak season, where they see the most number of guests and. They ended up hiring me as an intern to continue maintaining the application. Uh, before that experience. I was at. Our University. Agtech Research Institute AG Aid. And it was at hagg Aid where I designed. A simple data pre-processing pipelines. Um, using Apache spark. And we use the data. Did we use the data that I clean to ultimately predict rainfall levels and better allocate Water Resources for local farmers and governments? Uh, yeah, that's me.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCool, sorry. Apparently things are on fire.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nTelling people\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThat I am busy. And. Pausing all these notifications so? Leave me alone, all right. All right, everything's been on fire the past couple days. It's been fun all right, so a little bit about me. My name is Ben. Uh, I've been a. Software developer at Amazon for about eight years now. Um, yeah. Yeah, I started as an intern, uh, and then came in as Nesty one and worked my way up to senior engineer. Um. Been it a few different places of the company. Um, I started out in. As an intern, I started out in AWS, working on the console homepage team. And then my career kind of progressed into Alexa Communications, you know, working on calling between different Alexa devices, phones, messaging, Etc? Then over into prime air, where I built out a lot of the Drone delivery. Foundational software systems. Oh wow, yeah. And then, I moved over to asbx, uh, or better known as Builder tools, where I kind of helped Define the. Patterns that folks should be using when they are building web services at Amazon. So, I own kind of like the web service experience.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWow, yeah.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo? We're gonna head and Jump Right In. Can you tell me about a problem you've had to solve that required in-depth thought and Analysis?\n\nYeah, sure.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nCould I have a second to think of a good example? Yeah, sure.\n\nI'm trying to decide between two and. No worries.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWe're not in any rush.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay. Um, yeah, I think I've I've got one. So? In my junior year of college, I was taking an introduction to machine learning course, and it was the first taste of machine learning that I had ever had. And so, of course, like that's a big challenge in and of itself. For our term project, I have decided to partner up with one of my friends who was in his PhD program for. A cross-disciplinary between bioinformatics and computer science, so I was already like needy, but now I'm like waist deep and in information that I pretty much have no domain knowledge in. And. Um, what we were working on was the prediction of? Diffusion rates in. Hydrogel mesh. Environment so basically like, um, a little squishy Band-Aid thing with a lattice structure inside of it, and you basically put a drug solution in there, and you want to see, like, how long it takes for it to actually enter like the the skin, like the application?\n\nAnd so I knew nothing about. I knew very little about machine learning and even less about the. The hydrogel mesh systems and drug diffusivity. So, in this semester, I basically spent. The large half of the? The term learning about the the fundamentals.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nTo\n\n[Speaker 1]\nMachine learning and then.\n\nFurther expanded upon that by learning how to apply it to like. A field in which I had no experience. Thankfully, my my partner, he he, did this kind of work, like day in, day out, so he was able to explain it to me, however. In the process of it.\n\nI was forced to learn. Not\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOnly how\n\n[Speaker 1]\nTo. Clean the data and also. How to? Use predictive modeling to save time and energy on, like, sorry, let me let me rephrase that a little bit, and instead of like, actually, manually running like the the wet lab tests, which would take like? Inconceivable amount of time and resources and effort. We used, um, like different regression analysis techniques to essentially. Model out the diffusivity of. These Solutions through the hydrogel mesh system instead, and so.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOf course, like\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI had the help of um cat gpt and my my lab partner to help guide me through this process. However, I was in completely foreign territory and. What I had to do personally? Was? Find the original data sets of like the the density of the different molecules.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOr the drugs in this case. And\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThen\n\n[Speaker 1]\nFigure out. Like, which sort of solutions? What, what sort of like, um? Like, like, saline solutions to like? Uh, dilute these drugs to the point where they were actually administerable. And so I would I had to do research on?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWhat,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhat kind of um? Sorry, the the concentration of the solution. That'd be safe for, like humans, to?\n\nHave in their system and then taking these parameters. I would then have to plug that in to the um. The the regression analysis functions that? We had constructed and ensure that the. The results that we found were within the bounds of what was considered safe for humans and then ultimately.\n\nIn addition to this, like, there was also the variable that, um. Like, there's a different different densities of like the hydrogel mesh lattice structures, and\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWe ended up cutting out that portion because it just got too complicated for a single term project. So, so we narrowed down the scope and focused on the solution itself and the diffusivity, and so. Modeling of the solutions and the diffusivity in. Controlled, um, lattice structure. We, um, we were able to generate a long list of different chemical compounds and their diffusivity, which my partner was then able to utilize in his lab to actually. Produce, like real medical applicators for real humans.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo it was actually used to create real products after the fact.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight, right? Like? Our our data was actually utilized to help others basically like help those in need.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThat's very cool. It sounds like. The majority. Of the learning, so it sounds like it was two kind of main pieces like you didn't really understand machine learning all that much because it was. You know your first time kind of doing a foray into it, but also you didn't understand the thing that you were going to be doing machine learning on because obviously like? Yes, you're not a gotta. I don't even remember what profession that was, yeah.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo that makes sense. So you were kind of like in stuck in between, you know, these two worlds of trying to need to understand so? How did you know you were able to focus on? Like, how are you able to figure out what you needed to focus on? In order to actually resolve the problems.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm, so? Essentially, um? The way in which I determine, like, what my like primary focus was was? I, I thought about, like, within the scope of what I can do as an individual, and like with my domain knowledge. Um. I, I wanted to be able to contribute to, like what my partner was doing, right? I didn't want him to just carry the entire project by himself, and so. I, I took it upon myself to. To look into like? What part of this problem can I actually like, learn, and tackle by myself, which would be like? The. The basically the concentration, like learning about how, how concentrated of certain solutions? Humans can actually like handle, right? The concentration of the drug or the medicine, because you know, like, if if the drug is too concentrated, like the medicine can become poison? And so. Using this information, I made it. I made that my primary focus for the project and. I was able to do research through through various Publications and studies and consolidate all of that information into a data set that was. Um, very, very clear and concise. It was just the the compound. The chemical compound, and then like the concentration of that compound, which was, uh, like usable or pragmatic, and so then we had that to like. Set as a Target or like a bar. Like, anything above that concentration would be like bad data and like, like we, we don't want that so. From my work that I I did to assist in this, um project, like we were able to eliminate a lot of excess noisy data and\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUltimately provide\n\n[Speaker 1]\nCleaner results that were safe for human usage.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo? Yo, you're gonna have to excuse me because my my expertise is definitely also not in machine learning.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm, so\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWas the what was the actual output of this? Was it just good data? So?\n\nWas the outcome literally just data on what was acceptable? Like what the best values were like? Where were you trying to min max?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm, right, so? Like, so it's kind of like a two-step,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay thing\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHere. So, ultimately, we want to know, like? How fast can our solution diffuse through the applicator, right? But our solution also has to be like of a certain concentration.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIn order\n\n[Speaker 1]\nTo actually be usable, right? And so, I was responsible for figuring out the exact concentration that was acceptable.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nTo actually\n\n[Speaker 1]\nPut inside of the applicator.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo the output was like a single value, not necessarily like a giant data set.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight. It was like a single value for for, like, it was like an upper bound for, like each individual chemical compound. So, so we ran like a bunch of different chemical compounds,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo you basically created a function that we allowed you to. Insert a chemical and then figure out on the other side what the maximum was and the speed. It would go through the applicator and whatnot, right? Pretty much. And you use machine learning in order to like min max, the. The acceptable acceptability of each chemical, okay?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay, sorry. I'm like, I said, I'm trying to learn machine learning, so don't you did a great job explaining\n\n[Speaker 1]\nFor me. It's still like a thinking back to it is pretty pretty complicated and like. Like the the bioinformatics side of that is still pretty foreign to me.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAll right, my family does that stuff. So, believe me, I understand. Okay, so then. The outcome that you had. You said that there was a? Um, it was actually used in. Real world scenarios in order to create products to help people. What? What were the like, what was the ACT like? If you had to explain this to someone who doesn't understand any of it like me? What like, was there a specific like chemical compound that was actually useful? Like, if you had to tell people what you enabled, what would it be?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSorry, there's there's some Sirens blaring. Do you mind if I close the window real quick? Oh\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, go for it. Go for it. Sorry.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAnd then I, I hate to be that guy, but cuz you repeat the question. Oh\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNo, you're absolutely fine. So, I'm just trying to figure out like if I was to explain to somebody else, like I was to explain. What it is that you did? Would I say that you enabled some drug to go to market? Would it be that you enabled some? You gave a function to Industries so that they could. You know, evaluate chemicals, like, how would you say that? So, so, what\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWe enabled was basically the? Like, well, two, two primary things is first. We cut down massively on, like, raw testing time.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nHad\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWe actually gone into the lab and like injected the hydrogel mesh and then sat there and watched it and recorded it for, like, all these hundreds, if not thousands of different compounds that would have taken a a huge amount of time and human resource. And so, with what we did, we essentially were able to derive these diffusivity rates.\n\nWithout that like wet lab process? And then. Uh, the other thing we did, was we? We derived these numbers at a a safe level, like?\n\nIn the specifically in the condition of or in the in the setting of the hydrogel mesh. Like, because like the whole idea behind this hydrogel matching applicator is it's like a Band-Aid, basically, and in in areas where there's not that many nurses where they don't have like the technique to actually give you the jab. You would just apply one of these micro needle mesh.\n\nApply the medicine at the proper rate to like give you the proper dose without any kind of like medical supervision\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAt the right concentration, and all that, okay, right? At the\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight concentration at a safe level?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThat makes sense.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay. Cool. That\n\n[Speaker 2]\nMakes sense to me. Thank you for that. All right, let's move on. No, no, no, I. Inherently confusing subject, but you've managed to explain it to me well enough that I feel like I can explain it, which is good job. Thank you. Um. So, next question? Uh, can you tell me about a time?\n\nCan you tell me about a problem you had that required? In-Depth thought and Analysis.\n\nUh, yeah, sure,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm?\n\nAnd just think about that one for a second.\n\nSo, I'm thinking of an example. Right now, it is from. My internship at AG Aid, which is our University's AG Tech Institute and. This was back in 2022. And at the time I had never worked with large data sets before just small SQL stuff like, you know, like a phone book directory, and that was the extent of. Work with databases. And.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAt AG Aid, we were working on an initiative called ice spark, which sought. Uh, predict. Ice melt or given ice melt levels and various Geo. Initial data from satellites. We would want to predict, like rainfall, patterns for water allocation.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, so that way, like, you know, the farmers and the local government could make better informed decisions on how much water to actually like pump into the land? That makes sense for context. Sorry for context, uh? Our County was the and still is the largest grain producing county in the world. It's.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIs this King County?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nNo, it was, um, Palouse, or how was it called Whitman County? Okay?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSomewhere in Washington,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWashington State University.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOh, oh, oh, sorry, I was thinking of you dub.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, there's endless wheat feels like everywhere you look. Basically,\n\n[Speaker 3]\nI've never made it out there to believe it or not.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI've\n\n[Speaker 3]\nNever made it out there, believe it or not.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh, you're not missing out on much. Yeah.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAnyway.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm. But anyways, uh, so? Part of my job was collecting the satellite data. Um, from various different organizations such as NASA and eu's version, which is Copernicus. And the thing is, in order to make accurate predictions, you want to draw data from. Several months, if not years back, and these satellites are constantly like, uh, collecting data as they, you know, orbit, and so what you you end up with is millions of lines of just? Sensible.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nData.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nLike all sorts of random stuff, um. And. Having never worked with data on such a scale before, you know, my initial thought was, yeah. Like, let's go with SQL and like plug it in, but it's very quickly. I found out SQL was not fast enough and not capable of handling such amounts of data and. Yeah, I. I went online and I did some research, I said, like. I looked into it, and I was like, how can I speed up this process? And how can I like make this actually usable? And so? I stumbled upon Apache spark, and so I learned Spark and I learned about the data frames. And then using. A tutorial that I found online. I applied the, it was actually a Jupiter notebook that someone had set up entire years. And they were. They were processing a different data set, but I essentially took their skeleton. And then I was able to. Feed it. My CSV files, my my data, that I have collected from the. Satellites through a wet scraper and? Using spark, I was able to. Actually store all of the fields that I was interested in and speed up retrieval times upwards of 10x. Um. Like, had we gone the traditional route and utilized a sequel? It's, it's hard to imagine how long it would have taken to retrieve and process all of that data.\n\nUm. And then. With this sped up. Retrieval and access, along with the processing power. We we saved a ton of time and computational resource. Uh, which ultimately enabled us to make. Predictions about the the Water Resource to about, like the potential rainfall, and like, um, Water Resources that we might need.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nFor, for our local farmers and and state government, to to make their informed decisions.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay. So?\n\nWhat are the pieces of that that you didn't really understand going in? Was it really like spark?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight, it is primarily it was the spark. Which I had never worked with before and. Um. Also like the the scraping of the data from the satellites. I\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAlso like we\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHad to write a parser for that, which was new to me. Yeah, so.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI am. I, I know, I've heard the word spark before.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCan you explain to me what spark really does?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, so um. Spark basically. How do I put it?\n\nSo, instead of. Like our traditional like sequel, which is just, you know, like? Fields, and then, like. The data members there. There are these data frames in spark.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThat.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nEssentially.\n\nUm, not\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSure exactly how he's like, so is spark a different type of database, or is it a tool for processing data? Yeah, it's.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nFrom from my understanding. It's, um. It's, it's like both. Basically, it's like a framework. Okay.\n\nThat that enables you to like? It speeds up like the um, the rate at which you can process huge amounts of data. Uh, it serves as like the database and the the operations. Uh, that happened. Or, like, when you're when you're Computing? Um, from your spark databases. It significantly faster than than if you were to query from like a SQL database.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo? Is it that mean it's like an ingestion so? But I'm trying to rationalize what spark is my mind, so? Is it a like an ingestion framework that then stores into a database for easy querying out like? All right. How do you interact with spark?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm.\n\nWell. Yeah, kind of, it's like. The the way I interacted it. Well, at least in my experience, what we did, was we, we set up the the Jupiter notebook, and then\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWe called.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWe made calls to spark to. Essentially like? Not only. Create the the data frames to store the the fields that we wanted. But also to, to be able to. Uh, retrieve, and and. Perform operations upon those those fields.\n\nI'm not sure if that quite answers your question, though. I\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThink it's. I'm just trying to like. Understand kind of what spark does so, like, since you also had to learn what spark did, like, how did you go about learning about it?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight, so? Um. Like it was a, it was a Loosely coupled internships, so essentially we, we just got a task and then. We, we were supposed to figure it out on our own. So, I went online and then. I, I went to a couple tutorials, and then I found a tutorial that was doing essentially the same thing that I wanted to achieve, which was. Basically store and be able to access. Big Data. Like more than I'd used before, like by a huge margin, and so. Um, the way they set it up is. And the way I had set it up was.\n\nBasically. We, we had these CSV files. That contain the raw data. And then, using the the data frames in spark. We were able to. Basically like selectively. Draw out the. The specific geospatial data that we were interested in. Like, filter out the noise.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOne second, my dog is barking, and I'm not. I can't hear you very well. Oh sorry.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nBoopy!\n\nCome inside.\n\nAll right, hold\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUp.\n\nSo sorry about that. I have sequestered him. He will behave. All right, sorry, go on.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, so where was I, um?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYou're explaining to me how you were learning spark.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight, right? So, um, the the way spark works is like? Chunks up your data into, like? Data frames.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAnd then.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm. It performs like computational tasks. On these. Individual data frames. Um, instead of just going through, like a single, a singular like massive data set and just one by one. And, uh, so this? It's like, um, it's like, distributed, uh? Across these data frames like the computations are the students across the data frames in a sense. Um, which enables for faster. Run time and processing.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nFrom from my understanding. Could be like, slightly off. No,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIt's fine. So, like, what is a, what is a data frame really? Like, what's the difference between a data frame and a like? You know nosql database like column? Or sorry row?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm.\n\nI don't have too much experience in no sequel, but I mean,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, I mean, it's just like a hashment. No, sequel's just a hash map. Like, because, yeah.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI think the the key differentiator. Is that? With like a hash map or no sequel, um? It's just one continuous. Chunk of data. But they're just, you know. Like, if you want to go through it, you have to go top to bottom.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm. And then. With spark, and with these data frames.\n\nThe the computational load is distributed. Into into these data frames for, like, individual processing, and then you, you take all of them, and then you. You like, join the the data, the data frames together. Once, once you've like performed your computations. It results in an overall faster. Like runtime and reduced individual like? What do you call it? Computational.\n\nIt reduces the necessity for, like, computational resources online, a single host.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo? Let me see. Let me see if I can rephrase this, help me understand so the frames. Or so in a in a hash man, right? I have a key, which then has an object on the other side, which has all the value I have values I have in it, right? And so, if I want to look it up, I have to look by the key, or if I want to look at everything I have to do a full scan of the database and process each element individually. But it sounds like we're just saying, with spark, is it? It chunks related items together. So, like, if it's a Time series, it'll chunk everything that happened at, you know, the one minute Mark the two minute Mark the three minute Mark together so that you can better distribute them for processing since they're more related. Does that? Is that kind of right?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight, I think that's. Let me think about that for a second.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI'm using a bit of an example. I'm just trying to understand exactly how the data frames work.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, um. Uh, it's been a couple years, so I'm not like 100 on it. Yeah, I'm sure.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNo, it's okay.\n\nLike I, I'm\n\n[Speaker 1]\nPretty sure that's the. That's like the fundamental idea behind it.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, then you, you said, you had to learn this for an internship, right? Right? How did your team help teach you about how to use spark since I assumed spark was already there when you? Got there, or at least it was, like, it sounds. It sounded like it was something that was predefined that you were going to be using.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, um, we. Is kind of like a weird case, but we actually didn't have much of a team. So, the way AG Aid set up their internships was? You had like a mentor? And then some. Some initiatives had teams and then. Uh, my initiative was just me and my mentor, but my mentor went off to China for two months and.\n\nEssentially offline, so I did almost all of my learning just independently online. Okay.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThat must have been annoying.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nIt. It was definitely far from ideal, but. It's still like an experience.\n\n[Speaker 5]\nOh, of course, of course. Glad I\n\n[Speaker 1]\nGot to do it.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAll right. So, what? Let's go to. The\n\n[Speaker 5]\nNext question here.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo? Um.\n\nCan you give me an example of a? Tough or a critical piece of feedback that you've received?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, sure, um. So, in my project with hopsteiner? The the facility tour intake? Application that we were building. For the first couple of months. We had been building the application in flutter. Um, because we were under the impression that we had to deploy to iOS and to web. And so we had heard that flutter was a good framework for. That kind of work. Um. However, like two or three months into our work into our progress. Like, we had already set up the basics. Um, we had a meeting with one of the higher ups at hopsteiner, and we were informed that. Like what we were doing? Uh, we, we would have to scrap it and start over in Blazer, because that's what. Existing systems were built on. And that they were now concerned with integrating with those existing systems more than like the like, the cross, or the. Uh, the multi-platform was now a secondary concern, and that integrating with the existing Erp and CRM systems, which, like the the Microsoft. Ecosystem was now more important, and so, like, upon hearing this news, we we were all like. You know, like, dumbfounded, for a second, like we had just worked so hard on this for, like the past two or three months, and so? Um. Like our first thought, of course, wasn't. Wasn't great, but. We knew, like, you know, at the end of the day, we're building this for them and?\n\nLike making sure that it needs their requirements. And ensuring that, like, they get what they need, comes first so. Uh, after that meeting, we got together as a group after the meeting with the customer. We got together as a group and. Um, like, as a team and we, we had a discussion about it.\n\nWe. Basically like we did some preliminary research into.net and and thought about how challenging it would be to refactor all of our code and just basically restart in in.net. Although it was no easy task, it wasn't like, Easy by any means. However, like we did not have any other real option at that time, like that's what the customer wants, then that's kind of what we have to do,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nRight? Um.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAnd so, our next meeting we got back to to hopsteiner. And we're like, all right, like. We understand the request and like, we understand why it's important, like. As much as we would like to preserve our work for the past couple months, like we understand. Excuse me. That it's it's more important? That that it like fits in seamlessly with your existing Frameworks, and so we decided to go ahead and. Basically start over, at least on the front end. Switch to.net Blazer and build out from there. And. We had already gotten, so let me backtrack one second. Our application consisted of four main points, which was the login the. Uh, the Hop selection interface. And. Um, the, uh, the the calendar scheduling and the back end. So, we had set up the preliminary backend, which we were able to keep, and we had set in the login, which we had to completely scrap. And then we had some designs on figma for the other portions which still helped us guide the, uh, the development for? Portion of the build, and so we went ahead and. They said, you know, what? Like, whatever's in the past is in the past. Like, what matters now is like, we do what we can, under our new constraints and requirements. Um, so we went ahead and built out. As much as we could. Of the application. Before the end of the semester, we started in January the end of the semester was in May. However, their Harvest season was in August,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAnd so this\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThree-Month period after school ended. Was critical for them. In terms of like their business operations. But we no longer technically had any obligation to. Keep working. But since we had made that big mistake early on,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWe decided that\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYou know what, like, whoever is available this summer. Whoever has the time? Like, let's just get together and right our wrongs. And. We were able to develop an MVP that was actually utilized during harvest season. Um, we got real user feedback through. You know, those tours where, where people actually utilize this MVP to, to select their hops and to schedule their tours? Um, as a result, our customer pop Steiner. They were able to cut back on the the manual labor and effort for. That season, and they they renewed the. The contract with Washington State University, and then they also took me in as an intern to continue working on. Um, and I think. Had we been stubborn about flutter early on, then that could have definitely taken a completely different direction?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThat makes sense. All right, so it sounds like you, you guys basically. Took the feedback as is expected, but did the right thing in the end, which I think is a good story.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, but I think like looking back on it.\n\nWe probably should have spent more time like in those first couple of weeks or first month or so, like ensuring that, like, our initial trajectory, was the trajectory that we. Would continue to work towards instead of just okay. Like, let's, let's start working and making something like.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIt's a valuable lesson. Everyone learns.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nCool!\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAll right. Well, that is all of the questions that I have, uh, do you have any questions for me? Uh.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, um. So, you mentioned that you were in the internal tools? Team, right? And so I was wondering, like? Perhaps, what? What sort of like, uh? What, what is that kind of entail?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWell, internal tooling is a very broad subject, especially in a company like Amazon that's been around. Since before many development tools existed. Amazon built, uh. So, so an example of some of the larger things that we own? Um.\n\nBasically built the preliminary. Technology that if you know, like npm? Or you know of like cargo? Uh, we have something called Brazil. Um, which we built before package management really exists. It was, it was really, just like Maven, um, and so we built something that was more, um. A little bit more strict. They could scale to solve Amazon's needs as like a crazy large company with a bunch of dependency update stuff because Amazon does not operate under a monorepo, so it gets a little bit hairy. Other one that we own is something called Apollo, which is a deployment mechanism so. Similar to not really Jenkins. Um, it's a system that. Yeah, maybe, maybe, like, salt. It. It basically manages the deployment of executables onto physical hosts. So, like, if I own a host, I have Apollo create like a sub environment on it, and it's responsible for starting up the. Executable, however, that may work doing some monitoring on it and then gracefully taking it down, doing some load shedding load shifting. You know, it's been expanded to support a lot of different use cases over the years. But there's also. You know, our internal version of something like Jenkins, that also didn't exist back in the day. Uh, so it's a lot of a lot of that. Niche tools, like our ticketing systems, so we don't use jero. We have our own internal stuff that's built specifically for Amazon's needs, right? So there's. It's a very wide variety of things that Builder tool zones.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI see, and then. I can't even imagine how complicated something like Brazil must, because just npm like. I mean, even that has, like, seemingly endless, like calls and. The resources, and like packages that it needs to call on and then the hierarchy of those\n\n[Speaker 2]\nPackages, like. Brazil is definitely one of the more complicated things that we own because it doesn't make it, doesn't make any sense to me. There's a lot of people that unders. There's some people that understand it, and I'm just like, okay. Like you, you know, better than me. But. Yeah.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh, another thing I wanted to know was.\n\nWhat are? What are like some of the biggest challenges you find yourself facing, like day-to-day working at Amazon?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm. I can tell you, but I don't think that the challenges that I face are going to be the challenges that you would face as a new hire. Um, most of my challenges are about prioritization working across orgs. Um, trying to make sure we. It's like setting our sites in the correct direction. Um, kind of thinking about the longer multi-year plans rather than actual work that needs to get done right now. I\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSee.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, yeah, that's probably Beyond my scope, uh, at least for a while, probably yeah.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAnd then, I guess what are. What are some of the things that you really enjoy about Amazon's culture? Like, I think it's really interesting how Amazon has like LPS.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI feel like\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThat's very different from a lot of companies where there's not really like a clear, defined bullet point, like. These are the things\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWe care about. It is, the LPS are interesting. We get a lot of people make fun of us because we use them in everyday conversations to kind of describe the things that we're doing to help give people on board. Um, a lot of the leadership principles that are at odds with each other, right. So, like? Insist on the highest standards and deliver results or to LPS that are easily at odds with each other, right? Because I can't always build the right thing while delivering quickly.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight? So it's\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAll about, like balancing the LPS to come out with the right outcomes. And so it's interesting.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI guess that just comes down to like personal experience and judgment.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThere is one of the leadership principles, which is right, a lot, be right, a lot. Um, that one is definitely more applicable towards like managers and upper leadership. We kind of. A good leader is always or is often right. And being right can be a combination of, you know, judgment calls. But using your judgment with data in order to improve your judgment over time, it helps show that you are, in fact, a good leader, right? So? It's all kind of a flywheel that works together.\n\nYeah, I think I think the LP is really like stand out to me as like. Like, a really interesting facet of Amazon. It's definitely one that we harp on a lot for sure.\n\nCool! I think that that was it for my questions. Thank you for your time. I really do appreciate it. Well, thank you so much. I hope you have a good rest of your day. Thank you YouTube, bye!","numLines":577,"startLine":1,"totalLines":577}}}

While the candidate demonstrated some technical learning ability and adaptability in academic projects, there are significant concerns about depth of technical understanding, ownership mindset, and ability to operate independently in a professional environment. The candidate's responses lacked the depth and self-awareness expected for a software engineering role at Amazon's standards.\n\n## Overall Assessment\n\n**Rating: 2 - Inclined Not to Hire**\n\nJoshua presents as a recent graduate with basic technical exposure through academic projects and internships. However, the interview revealed concerning gaps in technical depth, professional ownership, and independent problem-solving capabilities that raise questions about readiness for a software engineering role at Amazon.\n\n## Earns Trust\n\nThe candidate showed mixed signals regarding trust and accountability throughout the interview. When discussing the Hopsteiner project failure (lines 481-504), Joshua acknowledged the team's mistake in choosing Flutter without proper stakeholder alignment but deflected responsibility by framing it as a collective oversight rather than demonstrating personal accountability. His response to the critical feedback showed adaptability but lacked the self-reflection and ownership mindset that builds trust with stakeholders.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Acknowledged the team's mistake in the Hopsteiner project and accepted the need to restart with Blazer\n- (+) Demonstrated willingness to work beyond contractual obligations during harvest season to deliver value\n- (+) Showed transparency about not having domain knowledge in bioinformatics during the ML project\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Failed to take personal accountability for the Flutter/Blazer decision, framing it as a team oversight rather than demonstrating individual responsibility\n- (-) Lacked proactive stakeholder engagement early in the Hopsteiner project to prevent the costly direction change\n- (-) Did not demonstrate learning from the mistake or show how they would prevent similar issues in future projects\n\n## Learn and Be Curious\n\nThe candidate demonstrated basic learning capabilities when faced with new technologies like Apache Spark and machine learning, but showed concerning limitations in depth of understanding and retention. Joshua's explanation of Spark (lines 326-448) revealed surface-level comprehension despite claiming to have learned and implemented it, with multiple instances of uncertainty and inability to clearly articulate technical concepts. The learning approach appeared reactive rather than proactive, relying heavily on tutorials and external guidance without deep exploration.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Showed willingness to tackle unfamiliar domains like machine learning and bioinformatics in academic projects\n- (+) Successfully transitioned from SQL to Apache Spark when faced with performance limitations\n- (+) Demonstrated ability to research and find relevant tutorials and resources for learning new technologies\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Displayed shallow understanding of key technologies despite claiming proficiency (unable to clearly explain Spark after implementing it)\n- (-) Showed limited retention of technical knowledge from previous projects, frequently expressing uncertainty about implementations from just 2-3 years ago\n- (-) Lacked curiosity about the deeper workings of technologies, appearing content with surface-level tutorial following\n\n## Dive Deep\n\nThe candidate's responses consistently demonstrated surface-level understanding of complex technical problems without the analytical depth expected for software engineering roles. During the machine learning project discussion (lines 56-183), Joshua could describe the high-level process but struggled to articulate the technical details, methodology, or deeper implications of the work. When pressed for specifics about Spark implementation (lines 323-448), the candidate showed uncertainty about fundamental concepts and admitted to not fully understanding the technology they claimed to have successfully implemented.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Attempted to tackle complex problems involving multiple technical domains (ML, bioinformatics, big data processing)\n- (+) Showed awareness of performance considerations when moving from SQL to Spark for large datasets\n- (+) Recognized the need to scope down the hydrogel project when complexity became unmanageable\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Failed to demonstrate deep technical understanding of implemented solutions, showing gaps in fundamental concepts\n- (-) Lacked detailed analysis of problem-solving approaches and trade-offs in technical decisions\n- (-) Could not articulate the technical reasoning behind architectural choices or explain implementation details with confidence\n\n## Technical Assessment\n\nThe candidate has exposure to various technologies through academic projects but demonstrates concerning gaps in technical depth and understanding. Joshua's work spans machine learning, data processing, and web development, but the explanations reveal surface-level comprehension without mastery. The inability to clearly explain technologies they've worked with (particularly Spark) and the reliance on tutorials without deeper exploration suggests limited independent technical problem-solving capability.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Has hands-on experience with diverse technologies including Apache Spark, machine learning frameworks, and web development\n- (+) Successfully delivered working solutions in academic and internship settings\n- (+) Demonstrated ability to integrate multiple systems and work with real-world data sets\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Showed shallow technical understanding despite claiming implementation experience\n- (-) Lacked ability to explain technical concepts clearly to a non-expert audience\n- (-) Demonstrated limited independent problem-solving, heavily relying on tutorials and existing examples\n\n## Communication & Interpersonal Skills\n\nJoshua demonstrates basic communication skills with the ability to engage in conversation and attempt explanations of technical concepts. However, the interview revealed concerning patterns in communication including frequent uncertainty expressions, difficulty in clearly articulating technical concepts, and a tendency to provide lengthy explanations that lack focus and clarity. The candidate showed some awareness of the interviewer's technical background and attempted to adjust explanations accordingly.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Maintained professional demeanor and engaged actively throughout the interview\n- (+) Showed awareness of audience by attempting to simplify technical explanations for the interviewer\n- (+) Demonstrated ability to handle interruptions and redirect conversation appropriately\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Frequently expressed uncertainty and lack of confidence in technical explanations\n- (-) Provided verbose responses that lacked focus and clear structure\n- (-) Failed to demonstrate strong communication skills necessary for effective collaboration in complex technical environments\n\n## Red Flags\n\n• **Limited Technical Depth**: Inability to clearly explain technologies the candidate claims to have implemented successfully\n• **Weak Ownership**: Tendency to deflect responsibility rather than demonstrate personal accountability for project outcomes\n• **Surface-Level Learning**: Shows pattern of following tutorials without developing deep understanding of underlying concepts\n• **Poor Technical Retention**: Cannot recall or explain details of recent projects with confidence\n• **Reactive Problem-Solving**: Lacks evidence of proactive technical exploration or independent solution development\n• **Limited Professional Experience**: Academic and internship experiences may not translate to enterprise-level software development demands\n\n## Recommendation Summary\n\nWhile Joshua shows basic technical aptitude and willingness to learn, the significant gaps in technical depth, ownership mindset, and independent problem-solving capabilities present considerable concerns for success in a software engineering role at Amazon. The candidate's responses suggest they would require substantial mentorship and guidance to reach the level of independent contribution expected. The inability to demonstrate deep understanding of previously implemented technologies and the reactive approach to learning indicate potential struggles with the fast-paced, ownership-driven culture at Amazon. \n\n**Recommendation: 2 - Inclined Not to Hire**\n\nThe candidate would benefit from gaining more substantial professional experience and developing deeper technical expertise before being ready for a role at Amazon's standards."}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5,"cache_creation_input_tokens":11472,"cache_read_input_tokens":54649,"output_tokens":1797}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"59b369a1-0168-4f33-ad94-57c7496d918c","timestamp":"2025-08-21T19:52:50.408Z"}
