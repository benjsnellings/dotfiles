So let's just go ahead and get started. Um. Let's start off with just some quick introductions. Um, can you tell me all about yourself?\n    25→\n    26→[Speaker 4]\n    27→Uh, yeah. Hi, my name is in computer science at University of data. I'm currently working as a Java developer at Google as a contract basis, uh, where I'm working on Gemini application over last couple of months. I was selected to a small team, uh, focusing on focusing on testing and improving the Gemini, uh, artificial interest and machine learning. Responses and refining the prompts and helping improve the quality and availability of large language modules. Is elements. Since Ai and ml is evolving so quickly, it is a great opportunity to. I understand how these systems work behind. Uh, the scenes and contribute something that actually being improved actually. Along alongside that, I was working at the back end. Developer using Java, microservices, springboot, and some some print-in favors like react and angular. I, I also working at, uh, I was working, uh, before at Advance Knowledge Tech where I was building, uh, building a web platform and a customer portal, uh, using Java and. Services and also work at MIDFL ID Services where I handled the bug fixtures application. Maintenance and unit. Unit testing my core skills, uh, coming to my course, because, uh, I'm good at Java springboard rest API stalker. Docker and system designs, but I really enjoy. Enjoy working across the stack across the stack where optimizing apis. User-friendly applications interfaces. Are tightening up an application that's about me.\n    28→\n    29→[Speaker 1]\n    30→Cool, all right. Um, I'll tell you about myself. Uh, so my name is Ben. Uh. I'm a senior software developer with asbx, specifically on the golden path team. Uh, the golden path team is kind of responsible for defining the standards of how Services should be built across Amazon, with web services asynchronous job. Cues websites. We kind of figure out what is the best way to set up your infrastructure, the right tools you should use. Um, and then disseminate those best practices across the company through various means. Um. It's a very complicated. Place. I've been in Amazon for about eight years, and so I've been in a variety of different places. I started off over in Alexa. Um, I also worked on the AWS console page, and I also worked in retail for a little bit. Then, I migrated over to Prime air, where I worked on the Drone delivery. Systems and then over into operator tooling. Where I worked on. You know, general tools so you can manage your Ops at scale. Um. So, yeah, I've been here for a little while. A little bit of telling you how this interview is going to work. Um. We this isn't, uh, coding interview. This is just an interview where you and I are going to have a chat. Um, I'm going to ask a bunch of questions and kind of get to know you a little bit better. Um. This interview doesn't always take the full hour, just as a heads up. So, if we have any extra time at the end, um, I will make sure it'll give you time to, uh, ask me questions. And then, you can, you know, maybe use the restroom or whatever you need to do before your next interview.\n    31→\n    32→[Speaker 4]\n    33→Sure. Thank you\n    34→\n    35→[Speaker 1]\n    36→Cool, um? I'm going to be taking notes over on my other monitor, so if you see me not looking at you. Um, that is why I have two different monitors and the webcams over here. Same thing with typing. I've allowed keyboard. I'm very sorry. Um, yes. So? Jumping right into this. Um. Can you tell me about a time? Uh, when you were trying to understand a complex problem on your team and you had to dig into the details to figure it out.\n    37→\n    38→[Speaker 4]\n    39→Yeah, sure, uh, thinking? I'm thinking the situation.\n    40→\n    41→Yeah, I can think of one situation when I was working at Midfield I.T Services. We had a hospital, uh, facing software, where, uh, where it was used, uh, used by the hospital staff, and it began the experience, uh, experience. Experience the failure, the retrieving the patient record, the issue was very.\n    42→\n    43→So it was affecting the only the certain users only the few regions, and there was a no, no clear error pattern locks as well as a part of this, uh, I was, I thought a part of engineering scene. I was given task to identify the task, so the rules and ensure the minimal downtime. So, and I also make sure that system is system is reliable offices and after, and it is handling the critical handling the patient's data. Uh, the first I started unlike the locks, and I used the tracing tools,\n    44→\n    45→[Speaker 1]\n    46→Uh,\n    47→\n    48→[Speaker 4]\n    49→With the workflows, which are getting which are getting affected to flow, and I notice that I was a there was a failure, which was, which was linkedered, uh, to a specific pattern. We, which also involved in the reset joints in the database. So initially, I was not able to clearly get the locks actually, but when, when I Deep dive into the database query where it was triggering out, uh? That I basically have a two filter out the locks. That blocks. I like, how many database queries and taking a long time long time and then try to replicate issues? Uh, in the control environment of the staging. I try to discover the problem was from the Legacy data was. Database, which were, which I had a schema, like, add a circular references, and it has. Uh, proper indexing. We don't have a proper indexing and and, and for Legacy database, we are you you are using. We are using, like MySQL, uh, over there, uh, over the period there, the period of time it has a circular left references, and there was a proper indicing, and I, as I told. Uh, to resolve this issue, I have to coordinate with the database. And I had to redesign the complete schema as well and and introduce an optimized index as well. This was, was, this was an artist take forward scenario, uh, for me, because I was working as a backend engineer. Issue was on the database side. The two give the proper structure I have. I have to be a proper deep dive into the current database schema. So, I also see the pattern pattern. What is the workflow and and the author understanding once? Uh, I try to read to redesign the into the schema, according accordingly without having circular references. Uh, and. Simultaneously. I also simultaneously. I also upgraded backend logic. Uh, HK situations, uh scenarios and detailed log. So, that is, capture the few few future failures. And, uh, and at last, I documented, documented the interposing. Which I had shared shared in the conference page. Uh, so, so that, uh, so that I can help the future Engineers that you in our team, the Juniors, to trouble the similar issues. And finally, I was able to. Resolve the issue where I I was reducer query latency by 40 percent. And and also eliminate alternate the intermittent failure entirely. The system of this system update uptime is improved significantly, and the client also reported the increasing increased stress in our platform of projects, um, so, and\n    50→\n    51→[Speaker 1]\n    52→Before you keep going, I have a few questions.\n    53→\n    54→[Speaker 4]\n    55→Um. Okay,\n    56→\n    57→[Speaker 1]\n    58→So the and I just want to. I'm gonna kind of repeat some of this back to you to make sure I understand exactly the situation. Um,\n    59→\n    60→[Speaker 4]\n    61→You\n    62→\n    63→[Speaker 1]\n    64→Had an API that was failing, right? Uh, it was, it was throwing errors. Um, and your task was to go in and figure out why it was throwing errors. And the first thing you figured out was that your logs didn't actually have. Um, you weren't actually logging the things that you were supposed to be logging. Right? Does that sound correct? Yeah, okay,\n    65→\n    66→[Speaker 4]\n    67→So?\n    68→\n    69→[Speaker 1]\n    70→How did you know that it wasn't logging the things that needed to be logging if you didn't have the logs to know? What was going on?\n    71→\n    72→[Speaker 4]\n    73→So we had the only. We are having the basic log, like when the control is control is coming to the service. We are logging to the. We were also. We are also logging when we are. We are responding back. I basically have the time frame where, uh, when we enter the service and just before the response time. But uh. I didn't have a failures, messages, failure messages, as well as what is the exact data with query query time. Actually, so?\n    74→\n    75→[Speaker 1]\n    76→You, you're saying that you didn't have any details in the Vlogs, but you still had how long the request took? Right?\n    77→\n    78→[Speaker 4]\n    79→Yes, right, exactly. So, if you\n    80→\n    81→[Speaker 1]\n    82→Have how long the request took, what did you do to figure out, um? Like what? How did you? Where did you go from there?\n    83→\n    84→[Speaker 4]\n    85→Are you? It's so, so fast. I try to check whether APA has any problem. Uh, the eight I eight. They don't have any significant problem I apart from log logging. Logging was not that enough. I'll try to replicate the same issue with the staging environment, so when I try to when I try to stay sitting anywhere, I got to know. What the database, the culprit corporate the data was causing the issue. So, how did you\n    86→\n    87→[Speaker 1]\n    88→Figure out it was the database that was causing the issues? If you didn't have the logs, right? That's what I'm trying to figure out.\n    89→\n    90→[Speaker 4]\n    91→Yeah, I try to. I try to. Yeah, I try. I try to implement the logging it, and I was changing environment. And then, I, I figured out this, uh, figure it out. The setting as a moment, it was actually the query, uh, which was calling the issue, uh. I added the, uh, adding the locks, uh, when calling the query. The query there is one time was taking to get back to the data as well, uh, from the query action.\n    92→\n    93→[Speaker 1]\n    94→So, so it sounds like you, you didn't have the logs, but you knew the request was taking a long time. And so what he did is you went to your staging environment and you enabled debug logging so that you would have more logs to view the request. And after you had more logs, you were able to figure out that it was the database that was causing the issues. Is that correct?\n    95→\n    96→[Speaker 4]\n    97→Yes, right, yeah, okay.\n    98→\n    99→[Speaker 1]\n   100→So now that you knew it was the database that was throwing the issues, what was the area you were getting back from the database?\n   101→\n   102→[Speaker 4]\n   103→That, so the database was actually low. And, uh, what do you mean the database\n   104→\n   105→[Speaker 1]\n   106→Was low?\n   107→\n   108→[Speaker 4]\n   109→Not low. It's slow,\n   110→\n   111→[Speaker 1]\n   112→Slow, okay.\n   113→\n   114→[Speaker 4]\n   115→Yeah, yeah.\n   116→\n   117→[Speaker 1]\n   118→So, so you just noticed that the database was taking longer than it should have? How did you know how long it was supposed to be?\n   119→\n   120→[Speaker 4]\n   121→Uh, it is you are taking like 12 to 13 seconds worth taking. But, uh, when we are working on the real-time publication, uh? Ideal takes. I have so much time. I also checked check that data. I also check the data storing in our table thinking of the entries which which we had a table. So, in the production we had, we had took four tables, which, uh, which using this query and each of the table having close to thousand of thousands of Records. So, on average, I thought like, uh, this kind of data should know should not take more than more than a second or two seconds.\n   122→\n   123→[Speaker 1]\n   124→So, question so, like when you're doing database queries, it really depends on what you're doing some database queries. Take a long amount of time and some are supposed to take a short amount of time. So, what I'm trying to understand was, this is a new issue. Where it was starting to take a long time after a feature launch, or has it been a consistent issue, and then they finally decided to go fix it?\n   125→\n   126→[Speaker 4]\n   127→So, this issue was long reported by the user, but we, we did not make any changes, uh, because it was kept in the lower priority. Uh, and it was sent as sent to me when I, when I started clearing the backlog, uh, that is where I started, uh, finding got it so, but this was a long time pending here actually,\n   128→\n   129→[Speaker 1]\n   130→Right? So okay, so users of your application were complaining that it had. Bad response times, and your job was to go figure out how to make the response times better, not necessarily that this query was bad. You wanted to figure out how to make the the how to fix that user complaint.\n   131→\n   132→Diving back into the actual query itself. You said that there were cyclical dependencies that were built in over time. Um, can you explain what you mean by that?\n   133→\n   134→[Speaker 4]\n   135→Yeah, I mean, we had. Lives are for user stories, which which we are implemented in the future. Uh, religious. And also, we had a few of the user stories, which have to, which have to implement in the near near near past. This actually had actually more complexity to query as well. And before, uh, before when it was actually. Raise. This issue was the issuer raised. Actually delay of 8 seconds, but when it started checking, it was actually moved to 60 seconds actually. Uh, this is this is where I got to know. The recent development has also caused in the query actually.\n   136→\n   137→[Speaker 1]\n   138→Okay, I think I understand. Um, but so what was the? What was the actual like, what was the item that was causing a cyclical dependency? Like, what was, what was the actual root cause of that issue?\n   139→\n   140→[Speaker 4]\n   141→So,\n   142→\n   143→[Speaker 1]\n   144→Yeah,\n   145→\n   146→[Speaker 4]\n   147→I mean, one of the recent user story. Um. The implementation was done in the such a way that we had to. We had to circular dependencies, uh, one table, one table from the another table. So, this was actually. Actually, a chain we are calling, and there was no. Uh, till the tree is completed from, uh, we, we was changing the calls. This is where. This is where we are causing a lot of issues. But when I was reading a redesigning my database, I got. I got another. Don't need to complete the tree. We just need to file the developer 3. Of a file level of the. File levels up to five levels. We reorganized and reorganized the data schema so. We can have a less complexity in our query actually.\n   148→\n   149→[Speaker 1]\n   150→Okay, I think I understand, um. All right, let's move on to the next question. Um. So, can you tell me about a time where you needed a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job well?\n   151→\n   152→[Speaker 4]\n   153→The situation.\n   154→\n   155→I wanted to build their restful service over here. You using electric search and I was working for a client who needed who needed an agent basis. Was a complex search. We search which you have also are a capabilities data set. And so I had to work with the basic search implementation before, uh, but the project has demanding for advanced query optimization and and customer analyzers, and I also integration with the kibana and real-time metrics, uh, so these things I was not ever before. So, I, I, I have to love history, learn the festival, learn the.\n   156→\n   157→Oils as well. My goal here is here! I is two designer to design and Implement the scalable search solution where? Where I can handle the queries, named queries, and multi-language data and also Dynamic filters. And. And also wanted to maintain the low latency. So, so to have this, uh, I need to have a deeper knowledge so that I can choose write the right Technologies and write coding strategies,\n   158→\n   159→[Speaker 1]\n   160→And I\n   161→\n   162→[Speaker 4]\n   163→Can have a low latency. Accuracy. And I realized that dialysis search was not only the only the requirement. I was. I. I also also learned more deeper. Uh, deeper, into the loose and's interverse, where we take the tokenized intervals. Uh, token strategy. And it tells, uh, it is. I mean, how to how to invert the indexes and how to check the custom analyzers using stemming and synchronization synonyming filter synonyming filtering. So, so I can improve the relevant scoring, and uh, I'll also learn base marking and different, uh, query types.\n   164→\n   165→And, uh, and I also tuned them into better performance, uh, performance. And I also learned something about the kibana dashboard as well, so that, uh so, visualization real quick,\n   166→\n   167→[Speaker 1]\n   168→Um. Let's I want to kind of like dive into some of these things. So let's, let's try to like, keep it a little more, uh, like focused on one thing, right? So, I think you said elasticsearch was one of the things you had to learn about, right?\n   169→\n   170→[Speaker 4]\n   171→Yeah, so.\n   172→\n   173→[Speaker 1]\n   174→What? Why did you need to learn more about elasticsearch specifically?\n   175→\n   176→[Speaker 4]\n   177→Yeah, um, yeah, because I had to work on a previous project where I I was using the basic search implementation. Uh, but Alex research, but Alexis search was not used at all in past. This and this API, which was creating which I, which we have to use analysis search, uh, over here.\n   178→\n   179→[Speaker 1]\n   180→Okay, so you you had to use elasticsearch for one of the apis that your your first search function that your old team or your an old project needed to use. So, how did you go about learning how to use elasticsearch more effectively?\n   181→\n   182→[Speaker 4]\n   183→Yeah, so for the same. Uh, I, I had to learn about the. Uh, in Lucian intervals. And, uh, so, where I can use the tokenization strategies, right? How I can. But how\n   184→\n   185→[Speaker 1]\n   186→Did you learn about it? Like, what did you do in order to learn more about elasticsearch? I understand what you had to learn, but I understand how you earned it.\n   187→\n   188→[Speaker 4]\n   189→Yeah, yes, by style. Step down. What are the, what are things are needed in the electric search, and uh? What would be the help will be for the helpful to implement in this project? And, uh, then I went and had, and I went to the my manager and with this list and asked?\n   190→\n   191→Workshop. I run this app and and he knows we do. We didn't. Also, as you know, we didn't have any workshops. So, my manager approved for the external Workshop as well, uh, where, whereas I went, I went to the external Workshop. Saw some of the audition documentations. Official documentations on the Galaxy search. That is how I started learning learning on the electric research,\n   192→\n   193→[Speaker 1]\n   194→All right, so you? So, basically, the first thing you did was you went to your manager and said, I want to learn how to use elasticsearch. Um, and I assume you told him why?\n   195→\n   196→[Speaker 4]\n   197→Yes, I, I told him, why? Because I wanted to create this restful apis, which has advanced, not advanced search mechanism. So,\n   198→\n   199→[Speaker 1]\n   200→We\n   201→\n   202→[Speaker 2]\n   203→Had a\n   204→\n   205→[Speaker 4]\n   206→Large number of data sets. Where I had you told him that elastic could be better? And, and I'm not aware of it. Okay, so\n   207→\n   208→[Speaker 1]\n   209→Then? You. There was no internal Workshop at the company that you were working on for how to use elasticsearch, so you went, and you got to prove to attend an external Workshop. So, what was this external Workshop?\n   210→\n   211→It's, yeah. So, this external version\n   212→\n   213→[Speaker 4]\n   214→Work basically online Workshop. Uh, so I used online tools to learn about the electric search and what are the methods methodology we can use? So this, I can. I try to learn from the external platform.\n   215→\n   216→[Speaker 1]\n   217→Okay.\n   218→\n   219→[Speaker 4]\n   220→And\n   221→\n   222→[Speaker 1]\n   223→So, in the in the workshop, how do they have you go about learning how to use elasticsearch? Like, what was the, what was the difference? How did the training work?\n   224→\n   225→[Speaker 4]\n   226→Yeah, that basically that the first they are explain. But they playing the concepts of the courses of the concepts and what is the electric steps and what? What? What do you need to analyze that in a real-time scenario, and uh, and what to start on the road or role-based learning path, and they told that what this, what is the elastic search engineering have, and what are the concepts, indexing queries, and uh, cluster design and performing?\n   227→\n   228→When collecting on the large Matrix and? And APM data. Using how to integrate the kibana lock? Log stat and. And they started with the Hands-On lab and the products where they helped me to build a search applications from scratch. Uh, they also. Showing how we can automate in the query using domain specifically specific language and and how we can configize and monitor the performance using kibana, and how, how it how it works in a real world in a data set? Can simulate the, simulate the production scenarios, and they also help me in the certificate education possible possible in the future as well.\n   229→\n   230→[Speaker 1]\n   231→All right. So, so you learned about elasticsearch at the workshop? It sounds. Sounds good. It sounds like the workshop was probably a great way to actually learn about it since they made you do a bunch of different stuff. Um, so once you learned about elasticsearch. How did that? How did that go in the workshop? Like, what did you were you able to create? The the API that you wanted to create for search?\n   232→\n   233→[Speaker 4]\n   234→Yes, uh, in the workshop, I was not able to create, but after the after the workshop, I will able to create the LS6 search. And, and also the solution which I created reducer query. This response, almost by 60 percent, and it also supported the multi-lang, multi-lang language search, uh, and I also able to achieve a creation of kibana. Me to also understand the elasticsearch in the deeper way. So, this was my, and this was my major experience where I have to learn with some learn something to. Everyone implementation.\n   235→\n   236→[Speaker 1]\n   237→All right. Well, thank you for that story. Um, let's move on, and I'm going to ask you another one. Um. Can you describe a time? When you needed the influence appear. Who had a differing opinion about a shared goal.\n   238→\n   239→[Speaker 4]\n   240→In your one, can you repeat the question one second, sure,\n   241→\n   242→[Speaker 1]\n   243→Um? I need you to describe a time. Uh, where you needed to influence a peer. Uh, who had a differing opinion about a shared goal?\n   244→\n   245→[Speaker 4]\n   246→Okay. And yes, I can think of one scenario. Uh, when I was working at ips Corporation, uh, so I was actually tasked with the optimum Legacy model, uh, model. Actually, it was, uh, it was handing the user based user based role access across the multiple services, uh, basically, we had multiple services and.\n   247→\n   248→Apis as well. We, we, we want to make sure different users with the different roles, uh, will have us have the access. Only for the few Services. No, not all of them, so we want to cook. Want to control based on the roads based on the roles they have? And so over here. We had to basically basically improve the performance, so the the system was already existing. And we also, and we want to also maintain the maintain without disturbing the existing functionalities, and from improving the performance. Comments when we are discussing one of the peer.\n   249→\n   250→Using the condition logic. Where we can have where we can control a layer directly and? With the. With this role-based handling, I was a I was not very, uh, I was not okay with it, but I, uh, because I was believing that this could be increased, uh, the the technical depth, because because we are adding a lot of technical logic in our controller, uh, layer in in it can make the future. I can make a few future also very critical, so we had. Multiple roles in place actually in the future. So I needed to actually. Uh, so I needed to actually influence my peer over here so we can. So we can adapt to the modular, scalable approach. Because we can, you can. We can use a strategy pattern, and we can also keep shared goals so that, uh, we can deliver the timely and and system test stability. Is also intact. When I propose this idea, I was. Was not very okay because he was thinking. The strategy pattern might be delayed. And. Instead of telling him. The strategy pattern is a better way. What I try what I try here is. Uh, I, I insulate the design, design, meeting, and, and we can have the paid program. I I try to walk through the real-time scenarios where I proposed a proposed a current current current patch, which which could break, which could break the under some edge cases. Some of the Educators. Uh, when we had nested roles or so,\n   251→\n   252→[Speaker 1]\n   253→Hold on real quick. Hold on real quick, um? I kind of want to before you go talk too much about the actual technical implementation of it. I, I just want to talk about, like, kind of, you know, dive into a few more bits of this before you, you know, tell me more. Um. So you, you said that you, you're trying to implement, um? Different roles for your account. Is that right?\n   254→\n   255→[Speaker 3]\n   256→Yeah, and so\n   257→\n   258→[Speaker 1]\n   259→Those those roles. I, I'm assuming you guys are using AWS? Or you're using Azure or something.\n   260→\n   261→[Speaker 4]\n   262→No, no, no, we are not using AWS instant. We are handling, uh, our application. It was our springboard application and, uh, inside the springboot application, we are we we were using the annotations, uh, for the role-based access and particular Services. So, so?\n   263→\n   264→[Speaker 1]\n   265→Okay, so you're using spring boot for for your services, but when you say roll based access, what are the roles that teams are? Using. Right, so\n   266→\n   267→[Speaker 4]\n   268→We have multiple roles like admin inside admin itself.\n   269→\n   270→[Speaker 1]\n   271→Okay, so these are roles similar to like. I am a software engineer like someone might be a manager. Someone might be a director, etc, etc. Is that correct? Yeah,\n   272→\n   273→[Speaker 4]\n   274→Okay, exactly? And\n   275→\n   276→[Speaker 1]\n   277→So. In, just like a couple sentences, what was the, what was the thing you were trying to improve about the way you used roles?\n   278→\n   279→[Speaker 4]\n   280→So, we have already have the roles which, which was a legacy system. Uh, so now, we we are moving out out of the Legacy system, move out from the Legacy system because it was slow.\n   281→\n   282→[Speaker 1]\n   283→Okay,\n   284→\n   285→[Speaker 4]\n   286→And when we are implementing when we are implementing the new strategies we are conflicting, uh? On the strategies between me, me, and my peer. So, so\n   287→\n   288→[Speaker 1]\n   289→Hold on real quick when you say that you have conflicting strategies when moving off of the Legacy system. What were? Uh, what was this specific item that was, um? You know in contention?\n   290→\n   291→[Speaker 4]\n   292→Um. So, basically, we should not. Uh, we should. We should increase. I, I'll be changing at this time and decrease the latency that was a major problem, uh, existing model. Okay,\n   293→\n   294→[Speaker 1]\n   295→So the\n   296→\n   297→[Speaker 4]\n   298→So, you're trying to move\n   299→\n   300→[Speaker 1]\n   301→On to the new system in order to decrease latency, right? Like, that's is decreased latency, and was there another item?\n   302→\n   303→We also have majorly\n   304→\n   305→[Speaker 4]\n   306→Have we had latency as a problem, all right. So that\n   307→\n   308→[Speaker 1]\n   309→Was, that was the big one is you wanted to move off of the old system for latency reasons, all right. So,\n   310→\n   311→[Speaker 4]\n   312→Yes, no.\n   313→\n   314→[Speaker 1]\n   315→So, what did you want to do in order to? Decrease the latency when you move to the new system.\n   316→\n   317→[Speaker 4]\n   318→Yeah, when, when we are where disc discussing the possible approaches, uh, move to the new system. My peer was, as it was on, to improve the. To improve this, she he was suggesting a quick path using a using a condition logic and direct\n   319→\n   320→[Speaker 1]\n   321→Control control layer. Branching logic in the control area in order to help improve latency by reducing the amount of code that needed to be traversed. Perhaps? Yes, and what was he and what was your yeah? What was your recommendation for how to fix it?\n   322→\n   323→[Speaker 4]\n   324→My recommendation would be like, not not to not to write the logic in the control country in the control controller layer instead. Uh, my goal was to have a study strategy pattern. So, so that I already noticed they are hierarchical? Application. Our application, so strategy application would have much more a better iPhone actually. If we directly add if we directly add in it this in the control layer, the maintaining would be very hard and difficult. Because we had a hierarchy structure.\n   325→\n   326→[Speaker 1]\n   327→So\n   328→\n   329→[Speaker 4]\n   330→When we revoke\n   331→\n   332→[Speaker 1]\n   333→So the, it sounds like the. Um. You thought your method was better because it'll be more maintainable in the future, right?\n   334→\n   335→[Speaker 4]\n   336→Yes, okay. So how\n   337→\n   338→[Speaker 1]\n   339→Did you like what? What specific actions did you take, um? To help convince. You know, your peer, like, how did you guys get to a consensus at the end? Like,\n   340→\n   341→[Speaker 4]\n   342→Yeah, first, I tried to walk through the real real scenario real world scenario, where? We can have a breaking news in the breaking the strategy. I try to show how to how hierarchical our roles roles are. So that he can understand where we when we are revoking, uh, revoking a room how much storage change we need to make if we have, if we had to go with the logic change, we again we should test the entire module. I, I, and I also believe the lightweight prototype lightweight prototype using using strategic pattern. So, so I can show him that I, I can show how? How can we use the predict predicate the basic filter filter filtering and how and show him how it could be looked? Clean the separation of corners and ex and extending in the future so?\n   343→\n   344→[Speaker 1]\n   345→You basically showed him why your approach was better. Is that right? So\n   346→\n   347→[Speaker 4]\n   348→Did\n   349→\n   350→[Speaker 1]\n   351→He? Did he agree after you showed him? Uh, that your approach was in fact better.\n   352→\n   353→[Speaker 4]\n   354→I actually, he asked me a lot of questions during the. This flow, and he and he also want to try to prove adding the country, adding the control logic is better, uh, but we took once, uh, once at one step at a time, uh. So, then we try to list what could be, what could be the better approach? So we created a conflict confluence document. Depending what a court case and. And which case, and what would be the better approach? So end of this I at the end of this? Um, we were able to get almost 80 percent 80 of cases. Our strategy of using using the strategy strategy over like? During the strategy pattern was a better pattern and the better way. And so\n   355→\n   356→[Speaker 1]\n   357→What was the actual tangible results that your customers felt based off of this change?\n   358→\n   359→[Speaker 4]\n   360→So, then, when we was implementing the strategy pattern, so the refactor module actually reduce the code complexity by 40%, uh? And we also improve the test coverage as well because we added just. We added it in the strategy pattern, right? Uh, we had to add no cases to the strategy pattern, and whenever we had a new role, we we need a. We need to add very less stress cases and. Able to add a pass security as well. How did\n   361→\n   362→[Speaker 1]\n   363→You manage to quantify the code complexity reduction?\n   364→\n   365→[Speaker 4]\n   366→Yeah, we use we. We use the sonar queue for this, the complex, uh, the the complexity we, uh, which was there before the recent implementation, uh, we tried to compare, uh, we tried to compare the sonar Cube reports.\n   367→\n   368→[Speaker 1]\n   369→Okay.\n   370→\n   371→[Speaker 5]\n   372→Cool. That's interesting.\n   373→\n   374→[Speaker 4]\n   375→Uh, and and user also reported, uh, we had a latency issue, right, and? And we also improved by. We also improved by 70 percent.\n   376→\n   377→[Speaker 1]\n   378→You had a 70 latency Improvement just from implementing a different question.\n   379→\n   380→[Speaker 4]\n   381→A\n   382→\n   383→[Speaker 1]\n   384→Candler. How much of that was attributed to using the strategies rather than just moving off of the Legacy system?\n   385→\n   386→[Speaker 4]\n   387→Uh, we didn't actually implement the complete complete model using the controller layer. Strategy, but but a high level. It was just improving 30 to 40 percent.\n   388→\n   389→[Speaker 1]\n   390→So, about 30 to 40 of the latency decreases because of this change.\n   391→\n   392→[Speaker 3]\n   393→Yes, fine. Cool,\n   394→\n   395→[Speaker 1]\n   396→All right? Well, that is all the questions I have. Um, do you have any questions for me?\n   397→\n   398→[Speaker 4]\n   399→Yeah, I do have one question.\n   400→\n   401→Uh, like, what would be, uh, like, what would be like first three to six months for HD? One role look for new joiners?\n   402→\n   403→[Speaker 1]\n   404→Typically the way that Amazon operates with new hires is we try to get them to hit the ground running. So, the first three to six months will probably be a lot of trainings to try to get you to understand. Uh, kind of how we do things internally build systems. We use package management, etc, etc. And then, basically, we tried to get you to hit the ground running, um. Amazon definitely values delivery in their sde ones, but also, we have a really high bar for the work that is actually being delivered. So, the first three to six months will probably be a lot of you have a lot of coding tasks to complete yet. You're getting a lot of feedback on. You know, raising the bar at how, how do you code things at a Amazon appropriate level? Um, to make sure that we can sustain it for the long term. So?\n   405→\n   406→[Speaker 3]\n   407→Yeah,\n   408→\n   409→[Speaker 4]\n   410→Well, okay, yeah. Cool! Yeah, well, if you have any other questions then, uh, good luck in your next interview. Yeah, thank you so much! Have a good day, bye!\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious.

Um, can you tell me all about yourself?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nUh, yeah. Hi, my name is in computer science at University of data. I'm currently working as a Java developer at Google as a contract basis, uh, where I'm working on Gemini application over last couple of months. I was selected to a small team, uh, focusing on focusing on testing and improving the Gemini, uh, artificial interest and machine learning. Responses and refining the prompts and helping improve the quality and availability of large language modules. Is elements. Since Ai and ml is evolving so quickly, it is a great opportunity to. I understand how these systems work behind. Uh, the scenes and contribute something that actually being improved actually. Along alongside that, I was working at the back end. Developer using Java, microservices, springboot, and some some print-in favors like react and angular. I, I also working at, uh, I was working, uh, before at Advance Knowledge Tech where I was building, uh, building a web platform and a customer portal, uh, using Java and. Services and also work at MIDFL ID Services where I handled the bug fixtures application. Maintenance and unit. Unit testing my core skills, uh, coming to my course, because, uh, I'm good at Java springboard rest API stalker. Docker and system designs, but I really enjoy. Enjoy working across the stack across the stack where optimizing apis. User-friendly applications interfaces. Are tightening up an application that's about me.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nCool, all right. Um, I'll tell you about myself. Uh, so my name is Ben. Uh. I'm a senior software developer with asbx, specifically on the golden path team. Uh, the golden path team is kind of responsible for defining the standards of how Services should be built across Amazon, with web services asynchronous job. Cues websites. We kind of figure out what is the best way to set up your infrastructure, the right tools you should use. Um, and then disseminate those best practices across the company through various means. Um. It's a very complicated. Place. I've been in Amazon for about eight years, and so I've been in a variety of different places. I started off over in Alexa. Um, I also worked on the AWS console page, and I also worked in retail for a little bit. Then, I migrated over to Prime air, where I worked on the Drone delivery. Systems and then over into operator tooling. Where I worked on. You know, general tools so you can manage your Ops at scale. Um. So, yeah, I've been here for a little while. A little bit of telling you how this interview is going to work. Um. We this isn't, uh, coding interview. This is just an interview where you and I are going to have a chat. Um, I'm going to ask a bunch of questions and kind of get to know you a little bit better. Um. This interview doesn't always take the full hour, just as a heads up. So, if we have any extra time at the end, um, I will make sure it'll give you time to, uh, ask me questions. And then, you can, you know, maybe use the restroom or whatever you need to do before your next interview.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nSure. Thank you\n\n[Speaker 1]\nCool, um? I'm going to be taking notes over on my other monitor, so if you see me not looking at you. Um, that is why I have two different monitors and the webcams over here. Same thing with typing. I've allowed keyboard. I'm very sorry. Um, yes. So? Jumping right into this. Um. Can you tell me about a time? Uh, when you were trying to understand a complex problem on your team and you had to dig into the details to figure it out.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, sure, uh, thinking? I'm thinking the situation.\n\nYeah, I can think of one situation when I was working at Midfield I.T Services. We had a hospital, uh, facing software, where, uh, where it was used, uh, used by the hospital staff, and it began the experience, uh, experience. Experience the failure, the retrieving the patient record, the issue was very.\n\nSo it was affecting the only the certain users only the few regions, and there was a no, no clear error pattern locks as well as a part of this, uh, I was, I thought a part of engineering scene. I was given task to identify the task, so the rules and ensure the minimal downtime. So, and I also make sure that system is system is reliable offices and after, and it is handling the critical handling the patient's data. Uh, the first I started unlike the locks, and I used the tracing tools,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 4]\nWith the workflows, which are getting which are getting affected to flow, and I notice that I was a there was a failure, which was, which was linkedered, uh, to a specific pattern. We, which also involved in the reset joints in the database. So initially, I was not able to clearly get the locks actually, but when, when I Deep dive into the database query where it was triggering out, uh? That I basically have a two filter out the locks. That blocks. I like, how many database queries and taking a long time long time and then try to replicate issues? Uh, in the control environment of the staging. I try to discover the problem was from the Legacy data was. Database, which were, which I had a schema, like, add a circular references, and it has. Uh, proper indexing. We don't have a proper indexing and and, and for Legacy database, we are you you are using. We are using, like MySQL, uh, over there, uh, over the period there, the period of time it has a circular left references, and there was a proper indicing, and I, as I told. Uh, to resolve this issue, I have to coordinate with the database. And I had to redesign the complete schema as well and and introduce an optimized index as well. This was, was, this was an artist take forward scenario, uh, for me, because I was working as a backend engineer. Issue was on the database side. The two give the proper structure I have. I have to be a proper deep dive into the current database schema. So, I also see the pattern pattern. What is the workflow and and the author understanding once? Uh, I try to read to redesign the into the schema, according accordingly without having circular references. Uh, and. Simultaneously. I also simultaneously. I also upgraded backend logic. Uh, HK situations, uh scenarios and detailed log. So, that is, capture the few few future failures. And, uh, and at last, I documented, documented the interposing. Which I had shared shared in the conference page. Uh, so, so that, uh, so that I can help the future Engineers that you in our team, the Juniors, to trouble the similar issues. And finally, I was able to. Resolve the issue where I I was reducer query latency by 40 percent. And and also eliminate alternate the intermittent failure entirely. The system of this system update uptime is improved significantly, and the client also reported the increasing increased stress in our platform of projects, um, so, and\n\n[Speaker 1]\nBefore you keep going, I have a few questions.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nUm. Okay,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo the and I just want to. I'm gonna kind of repeat some of this back to you to make sure I understand exactly the situation. Um,\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYou\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHad an API that was failing, right? Uh, it was, it was throwing errors. Um, and your task was to go in and figure out why it was throwing errors. And the first thing you figured out was that your logs didn't actually have. Um, you weren't actually logging the things that you were supposed to be logging. Right? Does that sound correct? Yeah, okay,\n\n[Speaker 4]\nSo?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHow did you know that it wasn't logging the things that needed to be logging if you didn't have the logs to know? What was going on?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nSo we had the only. We are having the basic log, like when the control is control is coming to the service. We are logging to the. We were also. We are also logging when we are. We are responding back. I basically have the time frame where, uh, when we enter the service and just before the response time. But uh. I didn't have a failures, messages, failure messages, as well as what is the exact data with query query time. Actually, so?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYou, you're saying that you didn't have any details in the Vlogs, but you still had how long the request took? Right?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYes, right, exactly. So, if you\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHave how long the request took, what did you do to figure out, um? Like what? How did you? Where did you go from there?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nAre you? It's so, so fast. I try to check whether APA has any problem. Uh, the eight I eight. They don't have any significant problem I apart from log logging. Logging was not that enough. I'll try to replicate the same issue with the staging environment, so when I try to when I try to stay sitting anywhere, I got to know. What the database, the culprit corporate the data was causing the issue. So, how did you\n\n[Speaker 1]\nFigure out it was the database that was causing the issues? If you didn't have the logs, right? That's what I'm trying to figure out.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, I try to. I try to. Yeah, I try. I try to implement the logging it, and I was changing environment. And then, I, I figured out this, uh, figure it out. The setting as a moment, it was actually the query, uh, which was calling the issue, uh. I added the, uh, adding the locks, uh, when calling the query. The query there is one time was taking to get back to the data as well, uh, from the query action.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, so it sounds like you, you didn't have the logs, but you knew the request was taking a long time. And so what he did is you went to your staging environment and you enabled debug logging so that you would have more logs to view the request. And after you had more logs, you were able to figure out that it was the database that was causing the issues. Is that correct?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYes, right, yeah, okay.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo now that you knew it was the database that was throwing the issues, what was the area you were getting back from the database?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nThat, so the database was actually low. And, uh, what do you mean the database\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWas low?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nNot low. It's slow,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSlow, okay.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, yeah.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, so you just noticed that the database was taking longer than it should have? How did you know how long it was supposed to be?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nUh, it is you are taking like 12 to 13 seconds worth taking. But, uh, when we are working on the real-time publication, uh? Ideal takes. I have so much time. I also checked check that data. I also check the data storing in our table thinking of the entries which which we had a table. So, in the production we had, we had took four tables, which, uh, which using this query and each of the table having close to thousand of thousands of Records. So, on average, I thought like, uh, this kind of data should know should not take more than more than a second or two seconds.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, question so, like when you're doing database queries, it really depends on what you're doing some database queries. Take a long amount of time and some are supposed to take a short amount of time. So, what I'm trying to understand was, this is a new issue. Where it was starting to take a long time after a feature launch, or has it been a consistent issue, and then they finally decided to go fix it?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nSo, this issue was long reported by the user, but we, we did not make any changes, uh, because it was kept in the lower priority. Uh, and it was sent as sent to me when I, when I started clearing the backlog, uh, that is where I started, uh, finding got it so, but this was a long time pending here actually,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight? So okay, so users of your application were complaining that it had. Bad response times, and your job was to go figure out how to make the response times better, not necessarily that this query was bad. You wanted to figure out how to make the the how to fix that user complaint.\n\nDiving back into the actual query itself. You said that there were cyclical dependencies that were built in over time. Um, can you explain what you mean by that?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, I mean, we had. Lives are for user stories, which which we are implemented in the future. Uh, religious. And also, we had a few of the user stories, which have to, which have to implement in the near near near past. This actually had actually more complexity to query as well. And before, uh, before when it was actually. Raise. This issue was the issuer raised. Actually delay of 8 seconds, but when it started checking, it was actually moved to 60 seconds actually. Uh, this is this is where I got to know. The recent development has also caused in the query actually.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, I think I understand. Um, but so what was the? What was the actual like, what was the item that was causing a cyclical dependency? Like, what was, what was the actual root cause of that issue?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nSo,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah,\n\n[Speaker 4]\nI mean, one of the recent user story. Um. The implementation was done in the such a way that we had to. We had to circular dependencies, uh, one table, one table from the another table. So, this was actually. Actually, a chain we are calling, and there was no. Uh, till the tree is completed from, uh, we, we was changing the calls. This is where. This is where we are causing a lot of issues. But when I was reading a redesigning my database, I got. I got another. Don't need to complete the tree. We just need to file the developer 3. Of a file level of the. File levels up to five levels. We reorganized and reorganized the data schema so. We can have a less complexity in our query actually.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, I think I understand, um. All right, let's move on to the next question. Um. So, can you tell me about a time where you needed a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job well?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nThe situation.\n\nI wanted to build their restful service over here. You using electric search and I was working for a client who needed who needed an agent basis. Was a complex search. We search which you have also are a capabilities data set. And so I had to work with the basic search implementation before, uh, but the project has demanding for advanced query optimization and and customer analyzers, and I also integration with the kibana and real-time metrics, uh, so these things I was not ever before. So, I, I, I have to love history, learn the festival, learn the.\n\nOils as well. My goal here is here! I is two designer to design and Implement the scalable search solution where? Where I can handle the queries, named queries, and multi-language data and also Dynamic filters. And. And also wanted to maintain the low latency. So, so to have this, uh, I need to have a deeper knowledge so that I can choose write the right Technologies and write coding strategies,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAnd I\n\n[Speaker 4]\nCan have a low latency. Accuracy. And I realized that dialysis search was not only the only the requirement. I was. I. I also also learned more deeper. Uh, deeper, into the loose and's interverse, where we take the tokenized intervals. Uh, token strategy. And it tells, uh, it is. I mean, how to how to invert the indexes and how to check the custom analyzers using stemming and synchronization synonyming filter synonyming filtering. So, so I can improve the relevant scoring, and uh, I'll also learn base marking and different, uh, query types.\n\nAnd, uh, and I also tuned them into better performance, uh, performance. And I also learned something about the kibana dashboard as well, so that, uh so, visualization real quick,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm. Let's I want to kind of like dive into some of these things. So let's, let's try to like, keep it a little more, uh, like focused on one thing, right? So, I think you said elasticsearch was one of the things you had to learn about, right?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, so.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhat? Why did you need to learn more about elasticsearch specifically?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, um, yeah, because I had to work on a previous project where I I was using the basic search implementation. Uh, but Alex research, but Alexis search was not used at all in past. This and this API, which was creating which I, which we have to use analysis search, uh, over here.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, so you you had to use elasticsearch for one of the apis that your your first search function that your old team or your an old project needed to use. So, how did you go about learning how to use elasticsearch more effectively?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, so for the same. Uh, I, I had to learn about the. Uh, in Lucian intervals. And, uh, so, where I can use the tokenization strategies, right? How I can. But how\n\n[Speaker 1]\nDid you learn about it? Like, what did you do in order to learn more about elasticsearch? I understand what you had to learn, but I understand how you earned it.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, yes, by style. Step down. What are the, what are things are needed in the electric search, and uh? What would be the help will be for the helpful to implement in this project? And, uh, then I went and had, and I went to the my manager and with this list and asked?\n\nWorkshop. I run this app and and he knows we do. We didn't. Also, as you know, we didn't have any workshops. So, my manager approved for the external Workshop as well, uh, where, whereas I went, I went to the external Workshop. Saw some of the audition documentations. Official documentations on the Galaxy search. That is how I started learning learning on the electric research,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll right, so you? So, basically, the first thing you did was you went to your manager and said, I want to learn how to use elasticsearch. Um, and I assume you told him why?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYes, I, I told him, why? Because I wanted to create this restful apis, which has advanced, not advanced search mechanism. So,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWe\n\n[Speaker 2]\nHad a\n\n[Speaker 4]\nLarge number of data sets. Where I had you told him that elastic could be better? And, and I'm not aware of it. Okay, so\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThen? You. There was no internal Workshop at the company that you were working on for how to use elasticsearch, so you went, and you got to prove to attend an external Workshop. So, what was this external Workshop?\n\nIt's, yeah. So, this external version\n\n[Speaker 4]\nWork basically online Workshop. Uh, so I used online tools to learn about the electric search and what are the methods methodology we can use? So this, I can. I try to learn from the external platform.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nAnd\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, in the in the workshop, how do they have you go about learning how to use elasticsearch? Like, what was the, what was the difference? How did the training work?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, that basically that the first they are explain. But they playing the concepts of the courses of the concepts and what is the electric steps and what? What? What do you need to analyze that in a real-time scenario, and uh, and what to start on the road or role-based learning path, and they told that what this, what is the elastic search engineering have, and what are the concepts, indexing queries, and uh, cluster design and performing?\n\nWhen collecting on the large Matrix and? And APM data. Using how to integrate the kibana lock? Log stat and. And they started with the Hands-On lab and the products where they helped me to build a search applications from scratch. Uh, they also. Showing how we can automate in the query using domain specifically specific language and and how we can configize and monitor the performance using kibana, and how, how it how it works in a real world in a data set? Can simulate the, simulate the production scenarios, and they also help me in the certificate education possible possible in the future as well.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll right. So, so you learned about elasticsearch at the workshop? It sounds. Sounds good. It sounds like the workshop was probably a great way to actually learn about it since they made you do a bunch of different stuff. Um, so once you learned about elasticsearch. How did that? How did that go in the workshop? Like, what did you were you able to create? The the API that you wanted to create for search?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYes, uh, in the workshop, I was not able to create, but after the after the workshop, I will able to create the LS6 search. And, and also the solution which I created reducer query. This response, almost by 60 percent, and it also supported the multi-lang, multi-lang language search, uh, and I also able to achieve a creation of kibana. Me to also understand the elasticsearch in the deeper way. So, this was my, and this was my major experience where I have to learn with some learn something to. Everyone implementation.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll right. Well, thank you for that story. Um, let's move on, and I'm going to ask you another one. Um. Can you describe a time? When you needed the influence appear. Who had a differing opinion about a shared goal.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nIn your one, can you repeat the question one second, sure,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm? I need you to describe a time. Uh, where you needed to influence a peer. Uh, who had a differing opinion about a shared goal?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nOkay. And yes, I can think of one scenario. Uh, when I was working at ips Corporation, uh, so I was actually tasked with the optimum Legacy model, uh, model. Actually, it was, uh, it was handing the user based user based role access across the multiple services, uh, basically, we had multiple services and.\n\nApis as well. We, we, we want to make sure different users with the different roles, uh, will have us have the access. Only for the few Services. No, not all of them, so we want to cook. Want to control based on the roads based on the roles they have? And so over here. We had to basically basically improve the performance, so the the system was already existing. And we also, and we want to also maintain the maintain without disturbing the existing functionalities, and from improving the performance. Comments when we are discussing one of the peer.\n\nUsing the condition logic. Where we can have where we can control a layer directly and? With the. With this role-based handling, I was a I was not very, uh, I was not okay with it, but I, uh, because I was believing that this could be increased, uh, the the technical depth, because because we are adding a lot of technical logic in our controller, uh, layer in in it can make the future. I can make a few future also very critical, so we had. Multiple roles in place actually in the future. So I needed to actually. Uh, so I needed to actually influence my peer over here so we can. So we can adapt to the modular, scalable approach. Because we can, you can. We can use a strategy pattern, and we can also keep shared goals so that, uh, we can deliver the timely and and system test stability. Is also intact. When I propose this idea, I was. Was not very okay because he was thinking. The strategy pattern might be delayed. And. Instead of telling him. The strategy pattern is a better way. What I try what I try here is. Uh, I, I insulate the design, design, meeting, and, and we can have the paid program. I I try to walk through the real-time scenarios where I proposed a proposed a current current current patch, which which could break, which could break the under some edge cases. Some of the Educators. Uh, when we had nested roles or so,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHold on real quick. Hold on real quick, um? I kind of want to before you go talk too much about the actual technical implementation of it. I, I just want to talk about, like, kind of, you know, dive into a few more bits of this before you, you know, tell me more. Um. So you, you said that you, you're trying to implement, um? Different roles for your account. Is that right?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nYeah, and so\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThose those roles. I, I'm assuming you guys are using AWS? Or you're using Azure or something.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nNo, no, no, we are not using AWS instant. We are handling, uh, our application. It was our springboard application and, uh, inside the springboot application, we are we we were using the annotations, uh, for the role-based access and particular Services. So, so?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, so you're using spring boot for for your services, but when you say roll based access, what are the roles that teams are? Using. Right, so\n\n[Speaker 4]\nWe have multiple roles like admin inside admin itself.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, so these are roles similar to like. I am a software engineer like someone might be a manager. Someone might be a director, etc, etc. Is that correct? Yeah,\n\n[Speaker 4]\nOkay, exactly? And\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo. In, just like a couple sentences, what was the, what was the thing you were trying to improve about the way you used roles?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nSo, we have already have the roles which, which was a legacy system. Uh, so now, we we are moving out out of the Legacy system, move out from the Legacy system because it was slow.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay,\n\n[Speaker 4]\nAnd when we are implementing when we are implementing the new strategies we are conflicting, uh? On the strategies between me, me, and my peer. So, so\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHold on real quick when you say that you have conflicting strategies when moving off of the Legacy system. What were? Uh, what was this specific item that was, um? You know in contention?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nUm. So, basically, we should not. Uh, we should. We should increase. I, I'll be changing at this time and decrease the latency that was a major problem, uh, existing model. Okay,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo the\n\n[Speaker 4]\nSo, you're trying to move\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOn to the new system in order to decrease latency, right? Like, that's is decreased latency, and was there another item?\n\nWe also have majorly\n\n[Speaker 4]\nHave we had latency as a problem, all right. So that\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWas, that was the big one is you wanted to move off of the old system for latency reasons, all right. So,\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYes, no.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, what did you want to do in order to? Decrease the latency when you move to the new system.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, when, when we are where disc discussing the possible approaches, uh, move to the new system. My peer was, as it was on, to improve the. To improve this, she he was suggesting a quick path using a using a condition logic and direct\n\n[Speaker 1]\nControl control layer. Branching logic in the control area in order to help improve latency by reducing the amount of code that needed to be traversed. Perhaps? Yes, and what was he and what was your yeah? What was your recommendation for how to fix it?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nMy recommendation would be like, not not to not to write the logic in the control country in the control controller layer instead. Uh, my goal was to have a study strategy pattern. So, so that I already noticed they are hierarchical? Application. Our application, so strategy application would have much more a better iPhone actually. If we directly add if we directly add in it this in the control layer, the maintaining would be very hard and difficult. Because we had a hierarchy structure.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo\n\n[Speaker 4]\nWhen we revoke\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo the, it sounds like the. Um. You thought your method was better because it'll be more maintainable in the future, right?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYes, okay. So how\n\n[Speaker 1]\nDid you like what? What specific actions did you take, um? To help convince. You know, your peer, like, how did you guys get to a consensus at the end? Like,\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, first, I tried to walk through the real real scenario real world scenario, where? We can have a breaking news in the breaking the strategy. I try to show how to how hierarchical our roles roles are. So that he can understand where we when we are revoking, uh, revoking a room how much storage change we need to make if we have, if we had to go with the logic change, we again we should test the entire module. I, I, and I also believe the lightweight prototype lightweight prototype using using strategic pattern. So, so I can show him that I, I can show how? How can we use the predict predicate the basic filter filter filtering and how and show him how it could be looked? Clean the separation of corners and ex and extending in the future so?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYou basically showed him why your approach was better. Is that right? So\n\n[Speaker 4]\nDid\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHe? Did he agree after you showed him? Uh, that your approach was in fact better.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nI actually, he asked me a lot of questions during the. This flow, and he and he also want to try to prove adding the country, adding the control logic is better, uh, but we took once, uh, once at one step at a time, uh. So, then we try to list what could be, what could be the better approach? So we created a conflict confluence document. Depending what a court case and. And which case, and what would be the better approach? So end of this I at the end of this? Um, we were able to get almost 80 percent 80 of cases. Our strategy of using using the strategy strategy over like? During the strategy pattern was a better pattern and the better way. And so\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhat was the actual tangible results that your customers felt based off of this change?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nSo, then, when we was implementing the strategy pattern, so the refactor module actually reduce the code complexity by 40%, uh? And we also improve the test coverage as well because we added just. We added it in the strategy pattern, right? Uh, we had to add no cases to the strategy pattern, and whenever we had a new role, we we need a. We need to add very less stress cases and. Able to add a pass security as well. How did\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYou manage to quantify the code complexity reduction?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, we use we. We use the sonar queue for this, the complex, uh, the the complexity we, uh, which was there before the recent implementation, uh, we tried to compare, uh, we tried to compare the sonar Cube reports.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay.\n\n[Speaker 5]\nCool. That's interesting.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nUh, and and user also reported, uh, we had a latency issue, right, and? And we also improved by. We also improved by 70 percent.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYou had a 70 latency Improvement just from implementing a different question.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nA\n\n[Speaker 1]\nCandler. How much of that was attributed to using the strategies rather than just moving off of the Legacy system?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nUh, we didn't actually implement the complete complete model using the controller layer. Strategy, but but a high level. It was just improving 30 to 40 percent.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, about 30 to 40 of the latency decreases because of this change.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nYes, fine. Cool,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll right? Well, that is all the questions I have. Um, do you have any questions for me?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nYeah, I do have one question.\n\nUh, like, what would be, uh, like, what would be like first three to six months for HD? One role look for new joiners?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nTypically the way that Amazon operates with new hires is we try to get them to hit the ground running. So, the first three to six months will probably be a lot of trainings to try to get you to understand. Uh, kind of how we do things internally build systems. We use package management, etc, etc. And then, basically, we tried to get you to hit the ground running, um. Amazon definitely values delivery in their sde ones, but also, we have a really high bar for the work that is actually being delivered. So, the first three to six months will probably be a lot of you have a lot of coding tasks to complete yet. You're getting a lot of feedback on. You know, raising the bar at how, how do you code things at a Amazon appropriate level? Um, to make sure that we can sustain it for the long term. So?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nYeah,\n\n[Speaker 4]\nWell, okay, yeah. Cool! Yeah, well, if you have any other questions then, uh, good luck in your next interview. Yeah, thank you so much! Have a good day, bye!","numLines":410,"startLine":1,"totalLines":410}}}

Dive Deep - **Inclined No**\n\n**Evidence from Transcript:**\n\n*Situation 1: Hospital Software Database Issue*\n- Poorna described a situation where hospital software was experiencing patient record retrieval failures\n- Initially claimed logs were insufficient, then revealed basic entry/exit logging existed\n- Under questioning, admitted to implementing additional logging in staging environment to identify the root cause\n- Eventually traced the issue to database performance problems caused by \"circular references\" and poor indexing\n\n**Strengths Demonstrated:**\n- Eventually identified the root cause as database schema issues\n- Implemented logging improvements for better debugging\n- Achieved measurable results (40% query latency reduction)\n- Documented the solution for future engineers\n\n**Areas of Concern:**\n- **Inconsistent narrative**: Initially claimed there were \"no clear error pattern locks\" but later revealed basic logging existed with entry/exit times\n- **Unclear problem-solving approach**: When pressed by the interviewer about how they identified the database as the culprit without proper logs, the explanation was contradictory\n- **Vague technical details**: The explanation of \"circular references\" in the database schema was unclear and didn't demonstrate deep technical understanding\n- **Reactive rather than proactive**: The issue had been reported by users for a long time but was kept in \"lower priority\" until assigned to clear backlog\n\n**Follow-up Questions That Could Have Been Asked:**\n- What specific database queries were causing the performance issues?\n- How did you validate that your schema redesign wouldn't break existing functionality?\n- What monitoring did you put in place to prevent similar issues in the future?\n\n**Assessment**: While Poorna eventually solved the problem, the inconsistent storytelling and lack of clear technical depth suggest limited ability to dive deep into complex technical issues systematically.\n\n### 2. Learn and Be Curious - **Inclined Yes**\n\n**Evidence from Transcript:**\n\n*Situation: Learning Elasticsearch for Advanced Search Implementation*\n- Proactively identified the need to learn Elasticsearch for building a complex search API\n- Took initiative to approach their manager with a learning plan\n- Requested and obtained approval for external workshop training\n- Applied new knowledge to create a scalable search solution\n\n**Strengths Demonstrated:**\n- **Self-awareness of knowledge gaps**: Recognized that basic search implementation wasn't sufficient for project requirements\n- **Proactive learning approach**: Created a list of required skills and sought management support\n- **External learning initiative**: When internal workshops weren't available, pursued external training\n- **Applied learning effectively**: Successfully implemented the solution with measurable improvements (60% response time reduction)\n- **Comprehensive learning scope**: Learned about Lucene, tokenization, indexing, custom analyzers, Kibana integration\n\n**Areas of Strength:**\n- Demonstrated genuine curiosity about advanced search technologies\n- Took ownership of their learning journey\n- Showed persistence in finding learning opportunities\n- Applied theoretical knowledge to practical implementation\n\n**Areas for Enhancement:**\n- Could have been more specific about the learning methodology and timeline\n- Would benefit from describing how they evaluated different learning resources\n\n**Assessment**: Strong demonstration of curiosity-driven learning and self-improvement, with tangible results from applied knowledge.\n\n### 3. Earns Trust - **Inclined No**\n\n**Evidence from Transcript:**\n\n*Situation: Influencing Peer on Role-Based Access Control Implementation*\n- Disagreed with a peer's approach to implement role-based access control\n- Peer suggested conditional logic in controller layer; Poorna advocated for strategy pattern\n- Used technical demonstrations and collaborative analysis to reach consensus\n\n**Strengths Demonstrated:**\n- **Collaborative approach**: Organized design meetings and pair programming sessions\n- **Evidence-based persuasion**: Created prototypes and walked through real-world scenarios\n- **Documented decision-making**: Created Confluence document to analyze different approaches\n- **Objective evaluation**: Used comparative analysis showing 80% of cases favored their approach\n- **Measurable outcomes**: Achieved 40% code complexity reduction and 30-40% latency improvement\n\n**Areas of Concern:**\n- **Communication clarity during interview**: Throughout the interview, responses were often unclear, rambling, and difficult to follow\n- **Inconsistent details**: Several technical explanations contained contradictions or unclear logic\n- **Language barriers**: Frequent grammatical errors and unclear explanations may indicate communication challenges\n- **Defensive responses**: When questioned about technical details, responses became more convoluted rather than clearer\n\n**Trust-Building Elements Observed:**\n- Willing to collaborate and find common ground with peer\n- Used objective criteria to evaluate solutions\n- Documented decisions transparently\n\n**Trust-Eroding Elements Observed:**\n- Inconsistent storytelling throughout the interview\n- Difficulty providing clear, direct answers to technical questions\n- Communication style that may not inspire confidence in high-stakes situations\n\n**Assessment**: While Poorna demonstrated some collaborative behaviors, the communication challenges and inconsistent explanations raise concerns about their ability to build trust through clear, reliable communication.\n\n---\n\n## Overall Recommendation: **No Hire**\n\n### Key Strengths\n1. **Growth mindset and learning agility** - Demonstrates willingness to learn new technologies and seek external training\n2. **Problem-solving persistence** - Eventually resolves complex technical issues, even if the approach isn't always systematic\n3. **Results-oriented** - Achieves measurable improvements in performance and code quality\n4. **Collaborative spirit** - Shows willingness to work with peers and find consensus through objective analysis\n5. **Documentation practices** - Documents solutions for future team members\n\n### Critical Development Areas\n1. **Communication clarity** - Responses are often unclear, contradictory, and difficult to follow\n2. **Technical depth and consistency** - Explanations of technical concepts lack precision and contain inconsistencies\n3. **Systematic problem-solving** - Approach to debugging and root cause analysis appears ad-hoc rather than methodical\n4. **Narrative consistency** - Stories contain contradictions that undermine credibility\n\n### Primary Concerns for Amazon Context\n1. **Bar-raising capability** - Communication challenges may prevent effective knowledge sharing and mentoring\n2. **Incident response reliability** - Inconsistent technical explanations raise concerns about performance during critical situations\n3. **Code review effectiveness** - Difficulty explaining technical concepts clearly may limit effectiveness in peer reviews\n4. **Customer obsession** - Reactive approach to long-standing user complaints suggests limited customer focus\n\n### Recommendations for Future Interviews\nIf this candidate advances, future interviewers should:\n1. Focus on specific technical implementations with detailed follow-up questions\n2. Ask for concrete examples with quantifiable metrics\n3. Test problem-solving methodology with scenario-based questions\n4. Evaluate communication skills through technical explanation exercises\n\n### Suggested Development Plan (If Hired)\n1. **Communication skills training** - Focus on clear, structured technical communication\n2. **Systematic debugging methodology** - Training on root cause analysis frameworks\n3. **Code review and documentation practices** - Mentorship on Amazon's standards for technical communication\n4. **Customer obsession principles** - Training on prioritizing customer-impacting issues\n\n---\n\n## Additional Notes\n- The candidate shows promise in learning new technologies but needs significant development in communication and systematic problem-solving\n- Technical skills appear adequate but explanations lack the precision expected at Amazon's standards\n- The inconsistencies in storytelling raise questions about attention to detail and reliability\n- Consider whether communication barriers are due to language differences or fundamental clarity of thought\n\n**Interview Quality**: The interviewer (Ben) did an excellent job of probing for details and identifying inconsistencies, which revealed important concerns about the candidate's technical communication abilities."}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5,"cache_creation_input_tokens":9881,"cache_read_input_tokens":54427,"output_tokens":2010}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"953d2f0c-d7df-4981-8a6b-21940fa11151","timestamp":"2025-08-21T16:50:10.688Z"}
