They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.\n\n**What to Look For:**\n- Examples of self-directed learning\n- Taking on challenges outside comfort zone\n- Seeking feedback and acting on it\n- Asking insightful questions\n- Exploring new technologies/methodologies\n- Learning from failures\n\n**Red Flags:**\n- Lack of recent learning examples\n- Resistance to feedback\n- Complacency with current knowledge\n- Not staying current with industry trends\n\n### **Earn Trust**\n**Definition**: Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing.\n\n**What to Look For:**\n- Admitting mistakes openly\n- Taking responsibility for failures\n- Building relationships across teams\n- Transparent communication\n- Following through on commitments\n- Treating all levels with respect\n\n**Red Flags:**\n- Blaming others for failures\n- Taking credit for others' work\n- Broken commitments without accountability\n- Lack of self-awareness\n\n### Evaluation Scale:\n- **Strong Hire** (4): Exceptional STAR examples, clear LP demonstration\n- **Inclined to Hire** (3): Solid examples, meets bar\n- **Inclined Not to Hire** (2): Weak examples, below bar\n- **Strong No Hire** (1): No clear examples, significant concerns\n\n**Please provide the interview transcript** and I'll evaluate it against these criteria."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":507,"cache_read_input_tokens":61597,"output_tokens":408}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"b4f0dc7e-5dbe-41f8-901e-b9e33fd0236d","timestamp":"2025-08-14T18:15:19.886Z"}

Real quick, um? So, just give me one second here.\n    42→\n    43→[Speaker 2]\n    44→Uh, okay. Hi, I'm a software engineer with around creation of experience designing and developing a scalable responsive applications. So, I specialize in react and rest graph apis and have good hands-on experience, are in Docker, kubernetes, and AWS, and building cicd pipelines to take care of from medium access and genius, so I can say, uh, I have strong background in oops, microservices, and real time. Even driven systems are using camera along with SQL, SQL, and no SQL databases, Etc.\n    45→\n    46→[Speaker 3]\n    47→Okay.\n    48→\n    49→[Speaker 1]\n    50→Cool. Thank you. Um, all right. So let me introduce myself, um? My name is Ben. Uh, I am a senior software developer at Amazon on the asbx golden path team. I've been in Amazon for about eight years. Um. While I've been in Amazon, I've been in a few different places, uh, I've gone from working on Alexa. To working on prime air. So, like the the Drone delivery program? To working on operator tooling to make you know operations that Amazon easier. And now I am. At the golden path team, where we kind of build out recommendations for how folks should be building microservices, async jobs, genai applications, Etc throughout the company. And then pushing on teams in order to build things that will allow them to actually have the recommended tool set to complete their jobs.\n    51→\n    52→Very broad. So? With that in mind. Yeah, so. Um, the way this is going to be working. I'm going to just be asking you a bunch of questions. Um, I'm going to save. We're going to basically go. We're gonna go through two different topics, and then about halfway through. I'm gonna go ahead and stop, and we're going to switch over, so I give you time to do the coding question.\n    53→\n    54→[Speaker 3]\n    55→Okay, um?\n    56→\n    57→[Speaker 1]\n    58→If you see if you hear me typing, um? That's just because my keyboard is loud, and I'm very sorry for that, um. But y'all. Also, I have you on the screen over here, and I have the second screen that I'm taking notes on over here. So I am paying attention. I'm just not looking at the camera.\n    59→\n    60→[Speaker 2]\n    61→Okay, cool, all right,\n    62→\n    63→[Speaker 1]\n    64→So? Let's go ahead and dive in. So, can you tell me about a time when you needed a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job well?\n    65→\n    66→[Speaker 2]\n    67→Uh, so, uh, if we think about situation, uh, one example. Want to say is? I didn't get, uh. So, the thing is.\n    68→\n    69→[Speaker 3]\n    70→I didn't get to exactly what you\n    71→\n    72→[Speaker 2]\n    73→Were asking.\n    74→\n    75→[Speaker 1]\n    76→Um. No, don't feel bad, telling me that you don't understand what I'm asking. I'm highly caffeinated, so I'm sure I'm talking too fast.\n    77→\n    78→[Speaker 2]\n    79→Um,\n    80→\n    81→[Speaker 1]\n    82→I again, this is. It's chill, um, so? What I basically want to know is. I,\n    83→\n    84→[Speaker 2]\n    85→I\n    86→\n    87→[Speaker 1]\n    88→Need to understand a time that you were like looking into a problem, right? And you realized that you didn't know what was going on right, and you needed to like, figure out you needed to learn a lot more in order to actually figure out what was happening in this situation. It could have been, you know, like there was a bug that you didn't know what was happening. It could be something like.\n    89→\n    90→He didn't know anything about graphql, so you had to like dive in to figure out how that worked Kafka. For example, if you didn't know how it worked, but you needed to implement it. So, does that make more sense?\n    91→\n    92→[Speaker 2]\n    93→Yeah, that makes sense.\n    94→\n    95→[Speaker 3]\n    96→Okay, so?\n    97→\n    98→[Speaker 1]\n    99→Uh,\n   100→\n   101→[Speaker 2]\n   102→If, uh, so the solution for this, I can say, is. Let me think of an example for this, uh? While working at Wells Fargo on backend microservices.\n   103→\n   104→[Speaker 1]\n   105→Uh,\n   106→\n   107→[Speaker 2]\n   108→I can say Microservice for processing real-time banking transaction. So I noticed that some transactions for, uh, intermittently failing without clear Allen block logs. So this was very critical because?\n   109→\n   110→Ever. A small failure rate could impact customer trust here, so the task was to identify the root cause and ensure the service can reliably without data loss. So, our failed transactions?\n   111→\n   112→[Speaker 1]\n   113→So,\n   114→\n   115→[Speaker 2]\n   116→Initially, I had no clear starting point, because, uh, the logs were awake here. And there were multiple upstreams and Downstream systems involved, right? So? Were begin, like replicating the issue in a lower environment and enabling detailed debug logging to capture more context. So, I learned more about how our Kafka event. Extremely work with the transaction microservices since I had. Previously. Uh, work in a management. So, and the thing is, uh, another one is, uh, I analyzed a message payloads and processing patterns and discovered this certain rate payloads always issue in the capital consumer. So, which wasn't being logged? So, I collaborated with the devops in to deploy enhanced logging to production for a short window. Uh, which confirmed the same issue in live traffic. So, uh, once I identified. A research.\n   117→\n   118→Uh, and sorry, and implemented a fixed to handle the edge case. Gracefully, along with unit tests to prevent regressions. So, then the result was like a fixed registered failure transaction in that service from around two percent to zero percent. So I also updated a logging strategy to capture. Informato, as it details in future instance. So the incident became a knowledge sharing session for the team, so others could troubleshoot similar streaming issues more effectively. Yeah, that's. Think I can say,\n   119→\n   120→[Speaker 1]\n   121→All right, let's dive into that a little bit. So was the errors being thrown, and, and you'll have to excuse me if I didn't catch this? Was the errors being thrown? By Kafka, or was it inside of the compute for the Kafka consumers?\n   122→\n   123→[Speaker 2]\n   124→Uh, I can say it was. Inside with the Kappa consumers.\n   125→\n   126→[Speaker 1]\n   127→Okay, so the Kafka consumers were throwing the air. What kind of tech stack do the Kafka consumers run on top of?\n   128→\n   129→[Speaker 2]\n   130→So this? So I can say. So?\n   131→\n   132→Expect the use. I can say, like, uh, Kafka consumers are back and work like a Java 11. The users spring and? Uh, spring, springboard, and spring.\n   133→\n   134→So, you asked about the text type only, right? Yeah, so, like\n   135→\n   136→[Speaker 1]\n   137→The the consumers, I understand, they're running Java spring boot, uh, their Java spring boot services, are they running? Like, what's the compute that they're running on top of? Is it a cloud consumers? It looks like you guys used AWS, but is it what is it running on top of?\n   138→\n   139→[Speaker 3]\n   140→Uh.\n   141→\n   142→[Speaker 2]\n   143→So? At the top, I can say. I can say in that scenario. No AWS is said to instances running Docker containers like springboot microservices. Like, so, Computing this how it was done actually in some setup services, could also run on AWS cases. Clusters are hosted on AWS. Instead of just running them direct on Ely. Uh, then the setup, like the storage, is also like a processor, transaction, or data persisted in post SQL running. On AWS RDS artifacts locks that? Then also monitoring was done on cloudwatch for AWS level Matrix grafana and Prometheus first level Matrix and Kappa consumer of a log monitoring.\n   144→\n   145→[Speaker 3]\n   146→Okay,\n   147→\n   148→[Speaker 2]\n   149→So either self managed Kafka on easy to Amazon. Amazon msk was used.\n   150→\n   151→[Speaker 1]\n   152→Okay, so the Kafka itself was running on a managed ec2 instance, but the compute for the consumers were running on eks and Docker containers. Okay, so the eks Docker containers were where the logs were not getting read from because they wasn't proper error messaging. Right? So, what is the? What is the thing that you did in order to improve the error logging? Was it just? Was there an exception being thrown and nothing was being logged for it. Did you actually have to change the? Um, the logging strategy, where the log's not being published to cloudwatch at all, like, what was the actual solution to the problem?\n   153→\n   154→[Speaker 2]\n   155→So, so exactly, uh?\n   156→\n   157→[Speaker 1]\n   158→What\n   159→\n   160→[Speaker 2]\n   161→I did to improve the error logging was? Was like to enable debugger, and it is logging here in spring cap. The configuration are temporarily for everything consumer group, so I would capture stack traces and method level of for failing messages. So, grab the message processing logic in a trade catch block, especially around the deceleration and transformation. All steps long,\n   162→\n   163→[Speaker 3]\n   164→The\n   165→\n   166→[Speaker 2]\n   167→Full exception stack and Trace here. And the message header.\n   168→\n   169→[Speaker 1]\n   170→So, so let me see if I understand correctly you. There was an exception that you could see in logs, but you couldn't root cause it. And so, what you did is you turned on the debugger. In production so that you could go ahead and get the full stack trace of what was going on. Right?\n   171→\n   172→Is that, am I understanding that? Okay, so? How did that work because usually when you attach a debugger to Java processes? It actually halts the process, right? So, like, was this, actually, the debugger being attached, or were you just having it dump extra logs?\n   173→\n   174→[Speaker 2]\n   175→So actually. Uh, I didn't get this actually one.\n   176→\n   177→[Speaker 1]\n   178→So, the way Java did, yeah, Java debuggers generally stop. The process when it finds an exception, right? If you said debug points.\n   179→\n   180→[Speaker 3]\n   181→Right? So\n   182→\n   183→[Speaker 1]\n   184→You, you said, debug points in a production environment?\n   185→\n   186→[Speaker 2]\n   187→Yes, and then.\n   188→\n   189→[Speaker 1]\n   190→But didn't that impact? The customer whose call you stopped? With the debugger.\n   191→\n   192→[Speaker 2]\n   193→So?\n   194→\n   195→[Speaker 3]\n   196→Okay\n   197→\n   198→[Speaker 2]\n   199→Now! I can say I'm actually a point, and so actually, when I said enabling, uh, deblogging, right, I meant like, uh, switching springboard? So, like on locker Kappa consumer classes, this is not interactive brother. It's just making application output, uh, much more. What logs so we can see the method, cause parameters, and stack traces without stopping the process. So, attaching a remote debug? Head to production. Can pass threats are caused by modes and impacts. SNS for customers like, not acceptable for banking transactions, so it also possess security issues, right? So, if the remote debugger Port is export? So, what I actually did in this case is, uh, updated kubernetes deployment, uh, to set a temporary logging configuration?\n   200→\n   201→And added a Target targeted logging. Inside the message processing or try catch so I could dump the exception by full stack price and nonsense to message metadata and deploy that content to production, or for a limited time, captured the logs in LK and rolled back into. Forward.\n   202→\n   203→[Speaker 1]\n   204→So, so let me see if I understand he didn't actually attach a debugger. You turned on debug level, logging in your logger, and then you added additional debug logs to a try catch block. Understood. All right. So then? That way. There it was, not an interactive debugger. It was just a debug level logging. Understood yes? All right, that makes sense. And so. What did you learn from the the debug level logging you basically? You said you dumped the entire stack Trace out?\n   205→\n   206→[Speaker 3]\n   207→Um,\n   208→\n   209→[Speaker 1]\n   210→Did you end up adding logs to the the service so that you could figure these things out in the future, but without having to go in and do debugging logging or is the is the standard operating procedure to go in and activate debug logging when you see issues?\n   211→\n   212→[Speaker 2]\n   213→Uh, so. So I learned actually was like once I had the root cause, uh, no, I did. I did not want the team to have safely to debug everything, right? So some sometimes something they went wrong? So, what I did actually learn and change it from it? Is that relaying only on generic exceptions? Makes troubleshooting slow and reactive, right? So, debugging level logging in production should be the last, uh, shot here. So, not a standard practice because? It's noisy and can impact log injection, or like some storage cost. And then, I added, structured in full level locks in Kafka consumer error handling code. So now! Always capture exception type and messages, uh, the relevant message key odd headers. So, consumer group and partition like this. So, this way, we we get enough context from most future instance without needing to enable the debug right. So, like, uh? In guidelines for all our Kafka consumers and share it with the team. So now, every new consumer service must include. This contextual error logs by default, a debug logging in production is still possible, but only. Use temporary and deeper tracing is absolutely necessary. So, basically, from this, I held for a long term like improved or default logging. So, the next single book could be diagnated from normal info logs without extra steps.\n   214→\n   215→Okay.\n   216→\n   217→[Speaker 1]\n   218→I think it makes sense. All right, let's move on to the next question. Um. So, can you describe a time? When you needed to influence a peer who had a differing opinion about a shared goal.\n   219→\n   220→[Speaker 2]\n   221→So, if you want me to tell time that I influenced it up here.\n   222→\n   223→So, let me think of an example. So, uh, one example I can see is, uh, I can say at Wells Fargo only. Be here working on new feature for the customer dashboard that require integrating both rfql and rest kps. So, my PA billiard we would stick? The rest for Simplicity. While I felt that a hybrid approach like using graphql for complex Mr data. And rest. For a simpler input, it would be better. So the task what we needed to agree on API strategy here before starting implementation. Since both back and service contracts and front-end queries would depend on it. All that actions I took was, like, I first acknowledge my peers concerns about complexity and team learning with graphql, so I gathered metrics and real examples for our current rest endpoints are showing that fetching nested data often required three to four round trips. Words, so I have created a small proof of concept. Showing that some dashboards data fetching in my stream. So, we reviewed this side by side in a technical design meeting along with the trace trade-off in caching, error handling, and schema maintenance. So I propose the com, a compromise here, like, adopt a graphql for data, heavy composite queries. Uh, keep rest for single or resource endpoints. So, the result was the team agreed to hybrid model. This registered damage dashboard loads. Seconds, and by 30 percent while keeping implementation complexity are manageable. My peers? Later acknowledge that.\n   224→\n   225→And. I can say that seeing real performance gauge and clear maintenance plan help change their prospect too. So, in this case, this approach becomes the reference pattern for other types building complex customer facing UV components. Meant this, so I have learned that influencing peer isn't about winning an argument, right? It's just about finding common ground through data prototypes and help with their concerns.\n   226→\n   227→[Speaker 1]\n   228→Makes sense. So, how did you alleviate? Wait, what were their main concerns? About graphql.\n   229→\n   230→So, yeah, what were they?\n   231→\n   232→[Speaker 2]\n   233→Okay, so gracias consons or layer, so a constant and consensual so? There was. And we. Then there was a learning team for the team, right? So not everything was familiar with graphql queries, like a resolve and implementation. So they worried it. Uh, it would slow the team down at the start.\n   234→\n   235→[Speaker 1]\n   236→Okay, like there\n   237→\n   238→[Speaker 2]\n   239→Was an increased complexity. Actually, uh, setting up graphics or adds another layer on the.\n   240→\n   241→Existing resting processor, so we have. And there was a secure like there was some security Councils to here. So, specific endpoints are more flexible, but that means. They can potentially request more data than internet.\n   242→\n   243→[Speaker 1]\n   244→I'm definitely I'm very familiar with graphql, um. So, what was your did they not have any concerns over the long-term maintenance of maintaining both rest endpoints and graphql endpoints?\n   245→\n   246→[Speaker 2]\n   247→I can say, uh, when coming. Um. So? This part. And. The thing is, uh, one of the biggest concern. Uh, in one of my page. Maintenance and cost of supporting both rest and graph rank points. Their point was that over time, we could end up with duplicate logic in two different API layers, which could increase technical depth like required more regression testing and. Duplicate onboarding for new developers,\n   248→\n   249→[Speaker 1]\n   250→So\n   251→\n   252→[Speaker 2]\n   253→They were also concerned about documentation here. If they understand the Rascal contracts, uh, we aren't keeping. So,\n   254→\n   255→[Speaker 1]\n   256→Then why, why use if the main concern is having two different Tech Stacks? Why was there an alternate option to just create, um, rest a rest endpoint specifically to solve the query patterns of the heavy doubt data? Quests, like, why did you need graphql instead of a bespoke rest API?\n   257→\n   258→[Speaker 2]\n   259→So I can say that.\n   260→\n   261→The reason why? Editor was actually. There was actually. If the only multiple cost to get the needed data like, we could keep the stack purely restocurrency. Team might still choose graphql instead of only few recipes that are its flexibility, like lines can Define exactly what fields they need without back and\n   262→\n   263→[Speaker 1]\n   264→Having to\n   265→\n   266→[Speaker 2]\n   267→Create a new endpoint for every variant. And so. Like, instead of creating say like a customer details. And all these basically call these things can handle all those through a single schema graph. Yeah,\n   268→\n   269→[Speaker 3]\n   270→So is,\n   271→\n   272→[Speaker 2]\n   273→Yeah.\n   274→\n   275→[Speaker 1]\n   276→So, the I understand the reason why you would want a graphql endpoint because you can just fetch whatever data you want. Not all of the data. But the point you made at the beginning was that you implemented it because it would allow you to reduce multiple round-trip calls, right? So, why did you not just create an API that would solve specifically? Um, that round trip call issue. Instead of implementing a new API layer, like, what was the, what was the key factor that said, no, we're not going to create an API specifically to solve this. We're going to create an entire layer, right? So, what was, what was that key factor?\n   277→\n   278→[Speaker 2]\n   279→So? We couldn't have a build a single. And I can say the thing is what I thought for this. Is? We weren't just have one fixture problem here. So our dashboards? Need change frequently? Because our product manager kept adding new combination of fields, filters, and related resources? If we, when we just restrain point for everybody, listen. We have ended up creating and maintaining multiple composite and endpoints over time, like repeating development, testing documentation, work every time. So with graphql, uh, we could just.\n   280→\n   281→And I can say that we were creating a new backend point every time there are a requirement. And Logics, uh, I can say the UA requirement shifted and give the backend knowledge centralized. While still reducing over fetching and under fetching, so deciding factor wasn't performance alone. It was long term adopority, I can say.\n   282→\n   283→[Speaker 1]\n   284→Right. Okay, well, that's just. I guess that didn't come out when you were talking about it earlier. Um. Okay. Cool! Um. So, let's go ahead and move over to the, uh. Coding part of this. Do you have the Live code link?\n   285→\n   286→[Speaker 2]\n   287→Yes, yes, I do have. Okay.\n   288→\n   289→[Speaker 1]\n   290→Um.\n   291→\n   292→[Speaker 3]\n   293→Sorry,\n   294→\n   295→[Speaker 2]\n   296→Ben,\n   297→\n   298→[Speaker 1]\n   299→No worries.\n   300→\n   301→[Speaker 3]\n   302→Are you\n   303→\n   304→[Speaker 1]\n   305→Going to be using, uh, JavaScript, today?\n   306→\n   307→[Speaker 2]\n   308→Uh, Java,\n   309→\n   310→[Speaker 1]\n   311→Java, okay?\n   312→\n   313→All right.\n   314→\n   315→[Speaker 2]\n   316→Give me one second.\n   317→\n   318→[Speaker 3]\n   319→Digital,\n   320→\n   321→[Speaker 2]\n   322→Okay?\n   323→\n   324→[Speaker 1]\n   325→Yep, looks like you're in, oh. Kicked me out, God dang it! All right.\n   326→\n   327→So, I pasted the prompt up here. Um. Go ahead and give it a read. Um.\n   328→\n   329→[Speaker 3]\n   330→Represents\n   331→\n   332→[Speaker 2]\n   333→A question.\n   334→\n   335→[Speaker 3]\n   336→So, we have\n   337→\n   338→[Speaker 2]\n   339→An array of seeds. Also, cities outwarded up, right? So, one represents.\n   340→\n   341→So sleep is occupied and zero reference. It is empty.\n   342→\n   343→So, what we can do is? For each seat, we can store the distance for the from the nearest ones to left side. If there are no? Right on the left? So you can keep it as Infinity or large number.\n   344→\n   345→So, then one right, low lock now, so what we can do is? Uh, from each seat, we can store distance from nearest one. Right side. So again, if there is no one on the right? Uh, keep it as Infinity.\n   346→\n   347→So command distance I can say for each mtcp 0. So, find the minimum of left distance and right distance, so that's the distance to the call closest person. Also the coolest person. We can drag the sheep that maximize the minimum distance.\n   348→\n   349→[Speaker 1]\n   350→Okay. Go ahead and coat it up.\n   351→\n   352→[Speaker 3]\n   353→What\n   354→\n   355→[Speaker 2]\n   356→We can do is we can have a class now.\n   357→\n   358→[Speaker 3]\n   359→I'm saying, like\n   360→\n   361→[Speaker 2]\n   362→The oblique.\n   363→\n   364→[Speaker 3]\n   365→Maximize\n   366→\n   367→[Speaker 2]\n   368→Distance.\n   369→\n   370→Glue just like this, you can say. Them. Inside this, we can have a method.\n   371→\n   372→You can find.\n   373→\n   374→[Speaker 3]\n   375→So, image.\n   376→\n   377→[Speaker 2]\n   378→Just equals.\n   379→\n   380→[Speaker 3]\n   381→You\n   382→\n   383→[Speaker 2]\n   384→Can sound like this.\n   385→\n   386→[Speaker 3]\n   387→And what\n   388→\n   389→[Speaker 2]\n   390→Will be like that?\n   391→\n   392→And last for. 2 divided equals minus.\n   393→\n   394→It's done.\n   395→\n   396→It's, it's not.\n   397→\n   398→[Speaker 3]\n   399→+ 2.\n   400→\n   401→[Speaker 2]\n   402→What we can do is here. You don't need to have this.\n   403→\n   404→[Speaker 3]\n   405→-1.\n   406→\n   407→[Speaker 2]\n   408→So, fill right?\n   409→\n   410→[Speaker 3]\n   411→Um, find the best seat.\n   412→\n   413→So,\n   414→\n   415→[Speaker 2]\n   416→Now what we can do is?\n   417→\n   418→Uh, in this C, it is equals to minus 1. On Max distance equals to -1.\n   419→\n   420→[Speaker 3]\n   421→Sheets of y\n   422→\n   423→[Speaker 2]\n   424→=?\n   425→\n   426→So, paying people? Support again.\n   427→\n   428→Uh, yeah, it should work, I think.\n   429→\n   430→[Speaker 1]\n   431→All right. Let's take a look through it.\n   432→\n   433→[Speaker 3]\n   434→Um,\n   435→\n   436→[Speaker 1]\n   437→All right, so? Starting at line 21.22, so. Tell me about the things your initial initializing and why you're initializing them.\n   438→\n   439→[Speaker 2]\n   440→So, the thing here? We store the number of seats.\n   441→\n   442→Okay, sure. Then, we we allocate two arrows arrays to pole, like, for each position on the distance to nearest top, quite seed on the left.\n   443→\n   444→[Speaker 1]\n   445→So, the what is the left distance and right distance store?\n   446→\n   447→[Speaker 2]\n   448→Uh, it allocates two arrows to hold.\n   449→\n   450→[Speaker 1]\n   451→Yeah.\n   452→\n   453→[Speaker 2]\n   454→Like for each question. The distance for the distance to nearest occupied shade around itself.\n   455→\n   456→And, and right, for the right distance, okay, and it's\n   457→\n   458→[Speaker 1]\n   459→From. So, like, what is the left distance is the distance from the last person?\n   460→\n   461→[Speaker 2]\n   462→Sorry. And\n   463→\n   464→[Speaker 1]\n   465→So the left distance array stores the distance from the last laughs person.\n   466→\n   467→[Speaker 2]\n   468→Uh, the distance I can say from the last left person you are asking, or yes for\n   469→\n   470→[Speaker 1]\n   471→The for the left distance array. What it, what is it? What are the numbers that storing represent?\n   472→\n   473→[Speaker 2]\n   474→It's gonna be. Get the story. Uh, represent is for the left distance array. It remains, like, how far is the close occupied the left, uh, including, like, uh, in my own position if it's occupied?\n   475→\n   476→[Speaker 1]\n   477→Okay. And what's the leftmost value going to be?\n   478→\n   479→So, the\n   480→\n   481→[Speaker 2]\n   482→Lefts are most valuable. It's gonna be like? I can say here if you see. Now, the leftmost value will be like, uh, it's something like zero, I can say. Uh.\n   483→\n   484→[Speaker 1]\n   485→Why would the leftmost value be zero? Why would the leftmost value be zero?\n   486→\n   487→[Speaker 2]\n   488→Yeah, I understand.\n   489→\n   490→[Speaker 1]\n   491→Yeah, but why? Why is the leftmost value zero? I'm asking so. You said the leftmost value in the left distance array is going to be zero.\n   492→\n   493→[Speaker 2]\n   494→Why is\n   495→\n   496→[Speaker 1]\n   497→It going to be zero?\n   498→\n   499→[Speaker 2]\n   500→That's because. The index 0. But the city is occupied one, so just. Distance of the closest portion on the left is zero. Like, you are already sitting there.\n   501→\n   502→[Speaker 1]\n   503→Right. So, if someone's sitting there, then it's zero.\n   504→\n   505→[Speaker 2]\n   506→So, if someone sitting there, that's zero. Yeah, what if no one's\n   507→\n   508→[Speaker 1]\n   509→Sitting there?\n   510→\n   511→[Speaker 2]\n   512→So if nobody is sitting there, I can say the value gonna be. Uh, if we can say, there is. No one here occupied. Say to the left of the current position.\n   513→\n   514→[Speaker 1]\n   515→Right. So then, what would the value be? So, the value\n   516→\n   517→[Speaker 2]\n   518→Gonna be like?\n   519→\n   520→It will be the last large number, so no person found on the left, right?\n   521→\n   522→[Speaker 1]\n   523→Sure.\n   524→\n   525→[Speaker 2]\n   526→So we can say the well, if nobody is there, we can mention it as Infinity.\n   527→\n   528→[Speaker 1]\n   529→Okay.\n   530→\n   531→[Speaker 2]\n   532→So, you usually n plus one. So, like, we use a larger number instead of mass.\n   533→\n   534→[Speaker 1]\n   535→Okay. Makes sense. All right now. Walk me through what the.\n   536→\n   537→[Speaker 3]\n   538→Um. The loop on line 27 does.\n   539→\n   540→7.7.\n   541→\n   542→[Speaker 2]\n   543→So, uh, it's start scanning from the left length. So, see if the current seat is occupied. I'll update the last operator I and distance to Lost. To and discuss the left occupied CT 0, so. So, if the current state is empty, so the distance to the nearest left occupiest is, uh, is like a minus last one of the pipe. So, and if if none has been seen last, half point is minus infinity. So this becomes a large a very large number so effectively. You can say no left.\n   544→\n   545→[Speaker 1]\n   546→Okay. And so, what are you setting the values to if there's somebody sitting in the seat then?\n   547→\n   548→[Speaker 2]\n   549→So the values if somebody? Should be in the seat eyes. I can say.\n   550→\n   551→Like, we are storing like some in left to the right past. Now, we have lost occurate equals so far. Occupations left distance of five. We are having a zero, right? Also, we are having a zero in.\n   552→\n   553→[Speaker 1]\n   554→If there's a person in the seat, then it'll be a zero distance.\n   555→\n   556→All right. So then? I think that makes sense, and then you're saying that the right to left is similar in the way it works. Correct?\n   557→\n   558→[Speaker 2]\n   559→Uh, yes.\n   560→\n   561→[Speaker 1]\n   562→Okay, so then walk me through what the loop on line 54 does.\n   563→\n   564→[Speaker 2]\n   565→154, I can see.\n   566→\n   567→So here, what happens is? If it gets over all c's to choose the best empty one.\n   568→\n   569→[Speaker 1]\n   570→Right, how does it do that?\n   571→\n   572→But how does it? How does it figure that out?\n   573→\n   574→[Speaker 2]\n   575→Uh, so it only counts as entities. The thing is. So for?\n   576→\n   577→[Speaker 3]\n   578→Uh,\n   579→\n   580→[Speaker 2]\n   581→I the distance to the closest person is the minimum of left and the right distance. And if the seat closed person distance? Is better than any scene so forth. If it is, so far, we can record it, right?\n   582→\n   583→[Speaker 1]\n   584→So then real quick? Can you show me what the? Um, the left array. And the right array would look like. For the example here. At the top. So, on line 13 and 14, if you could just fill those two in? For the example I gave you.\n   585→\n   586→[Speaker 3]\n   587→So, you\n   588→\n   589→[Speaker 2]\n   590→Want me to? I should do like?\n   591→\n   592→[Speaker 1]\n   593→I mean, you should be able to fill it out. By just the pseudo, you should know how the pseudocode works so you can just fill in these arrays for me so that I understand exactly what's going to be here. Right?\n   594→\n   595→[Speaker 3]\n   596→So left, right\n   597→\n   598→[Speaker 2]\n   599→Pass? I can say.\n   600→\n   601→[Speaker 3]\n   602→So\n   603→\n   604→[Speaker 2]\n   605→It could be zero.\n   606→\n   607→Then we have 51 - 0. Then I equals to 2 minus 4.\n   608→\n   609→Right equals to?\n   610→\n   611→So, you want me to show how I got these values?\n   612→\n   613→[Speaker 1]\n   614→No, it makes sense. Um, can you do it again for? This array.\n   615→\n   616→[Speaker 2]\n   617→0, 0, 1, 0.\n   618→\n   619→Yeah,\n   620→\n   621→[Speaker 1]\n   622→Uh, you can start filling it in.\n   623→\n   624→[Speaker 2]\n   625→Push, it will be 11.\n   626→\n   627→So T - 0 and?\n   628→\n   629→0, {comma}, 1.\n   630→\n   631→And 8 minus 5 in V3.\n   632→\n   633→You hear what TV can do is?\n   634→\n   635→And we have a -4.\n   636→\n   637→Yeah, can you see this? Ben,\n   638→\n   639→[Speaker 1]\n   640→Yeah. So what's the right? Answer in this scenario.\n   641→\n   642→[Speaker 3]\n   643→Uh,\n   644→\n   645→[Speaker 2]\n   646→Give me one second. I didn't hear your problem.\n   647→\n   648→[Speaker 1]\n   649→What is that can be the answer?\n   650→\n   651→[Speaker 2]\n   652→So I can say. Both are right.\n   653→\n   654→[Speaker 1]\n   655→Both are right.\n   656→\n   657→[Speaker 3]\n   658→Yeah.\n   659→\n   660→So?\n   661→\n   662→[Speaker 1]\n   663→Why is the best seat index zero?\n   664→\n   665→[Speaker 2]\n   666→I can say that.\n   667→\n   668→[Speaker 3]\n   669→See.\n   670→\n   671→[Speaker 2]\n   672→Your code is, it is because of how the distance, uh. In left distance and right distance come out when you take. So interesting question math dot mean lab distance of I comma right distance of I?\n   673→\n   674→So I can say, uh, let's check index 0 left distance of 0 equals to. Infinity. Uh, and right distance of 0 equals to 2 and\n   675→\n   676→[Speaker 3]\n   677→The\n   678→\n   679→[Speaker 2]\n   680→Nearest equation of math dot Min, uh, infinity comma to equation 2.\n   681→\n   682→The max level distance is and both index 0 and index 7 have it. Uh, if you are? Is, then it will pick the first seat or then reaches the Mac resistance with season at zero.\n   683→\n   684→[Speaker 1]\n   685→So? I'm not asking why your code does, and I'm asking why you coded it to do that.\n   686→\n   687→[Speaker 2]\n   688→I\n   689→\n   690→[Speaker 3]\n   691→Can say that.\n   692→\n   693→[Speaker 2]\n   694→That we. That's what. We get. We get the best seat, right? So, if you want to pick the right most one in a time? So change greater than to greater than or equal to, or if you want.\n   695→\n   696→[Speaker 1]\n   697→Yes, but okay, I'm just curious. I'm not curious about how I would change the code to make it happen. I'm just curious why that is the case. Like, why did we code it that way?\n   698→\n   699→[Speaker 2]\n   700→So?\n   701→\n   702→I can say that.\n   703→\n   704→Give me one second. Let me think about it.\n   705→\n   706→[Speaker 1]\n   707→Yeah, it's fine. I think we're actually out of time. Um,\n   708→\n   709→[Speaker 2]\n   710→I don't know. Give me a second.\n   711→\n   712→Uh, I I'll finish the answer, uh, maybe it's happening. And the reason, it's correct. That's why we are actually tied to how we normally write. Is find Max Loops. So why fix index 0? I can say we start with Max distance equals to minus one. Uh, as soon as we find the nearest empty seat with the nearest bigger than Max distance RV update. So once, uh, we set math Christians to a certain value, uh, we never replace it. We see the same value again because the condition is greater than or not greater than or equals to. That means, uh, I can say the first ship that hits the max distance becomes based. Letter seeds have the same Max range, how we ignore them. So, why, if you ask me why it's correct the way as this, uh, the deliberate default choice, uh, in a lot of fine match problems? Speaking of first occurrence of the max respectable and awards extra time breaking walks.\n   713→\n   714→Yeah, so\n   715→\n   716→[Speaker 1]\n   717→You'd basically just followed a standard fine Max that you, you already know how to code up.\n   718→\n   719→[Speaker 2]\n   720→Yes, okay, that's right.\n   721→\n   722→[Speaker 1]\n   723→Cool, all right? Well, we are out of time.\n   724→\n   725→[Speaker 2]\n   726→Um,\n   727→\n   728→[Speaker 1]\n   729→We are already actually technically over time. Is there any questions you have for me real quick before I go?\n   730→\n   731→[Speaker 2]\n   732→Uh, okay. Did you work on, uh, any development that means any product development part?\n   733→\n   734→[Speaker 1]\n   735→Did I ever do product development?\n   736→\n   737→[Speaker 2]\n   738→Yes,\n   739→\n   740→[Speaker 1]\n   741→Um, I have done a lot of product development. Yes, I've back in my time in Alexa in primary.\n   742→\n   743→[Speaker 2]\n   744→How did you gather the feedback from the customers if you? If you work on something that? Uh, that you, you're welcome.\n   745→\n   746→[Speaker 1]\n   747→How do I gather feedback? Well, it depends on who my customers are. You know, key number one is to understand your customers. Um, so when I was in Prime air primarily, I would go talk to the maintenance technicians. I would just walk into their labs and bug them. For when I worked in Alexa. A lot of times, we had entire teams that were dedicated to going and collecting user feedback, uh, be it via surveys or consuming emails that people sent in about things that they didn't like. So, there it really does depend, but it is important that you figure out how to get in contact with your customers, no matter what it is that you're building.\n   748→\n   749→Thanks, take it then. Yeah. Cool, all right. Well, good luck with the rest of your interviews. Thank you so much.\n   750→\n   751→Oh my God.\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious.

My computer was muted.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nAll\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight. So, how's your day been so far?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIt went very well, but the worst thing happened is, uh, before I have. I shared my mic, so that's why I didn't take the call. So, yeah, it's been a bit of worry for me, but I hope maybe he will take the call. Oh,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYou, you were. You weren't able to make it to your first interview.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, yes,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, don't worry about it. I'll, um. I'll ping the recruiter and make sure that they. They\n\n[Speaker 2]\nKnow what's\n\n[Speaker 1]\nGoing on?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay, let\n\n[Speaker 1]\nMe let me do that for you. Real quick, um? So, just give me one second here.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, okay. Hi, I'm a software engineer with around creation of experience designing and developing a scalable responsive applications. So, I specialize in react and rest graph apis and have good hands-on experience, are in Docker, kubernetes, and AWS, and building cicd pipelines to take care of from medium access and genius, so I can say, uh, I have strong background in oops, microservices, and real time. Even driven systems are using camera along with SQL, SQL, and no SQL databases, Etc.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nOkay.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nCool. Thank you. Um, all right. So let me introduce myself, um? My name is Ben. Uh, I am a senior software developer at Amazon on the asbx golden path team. I've been in Amazon for about eight years. Um. While I've been in Amazon, I've been in a few different places, uh, I've gone from working on Alexa. To working on prime air. So, like the the Drone delivery program? To working on operator tooling to make you know operations that Amazon easier. And now I am. At the golden path team, where we kind of build out recommendations for how folks should be building microservices, async jobs, genai applications, Etc throughout the company. And then pushing on teams in order to build things that will allow them to actually have the recommended tool set to complete their jobs.\n\nVery broad. So? With that in mind. Yeah, so. Um, the way this is going to be working. I'm going to just be asking you a bunch of questions. Um, I'm going to save. We're going to basically go. We're gonna go through two different topics, and then about halfway through. I'm gonna go ahead and stop, and we're going to switch over, so I give you time to do the coding question.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nOkay, um?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nIf you see if you hear me typing, um? That's just because my keyboard is loud, and I'm very sorry for that, um. But y'all. Also, I have you on the screen over here, and I have the second screen that I'm taking notes on over here. So I am paying attention. I'm just not looking at the camera.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay, cool, all right,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo? Let's go ahead and dive in. So, can you tell me about a time when you needed a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job well?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, so, uh, if we think about situation, uh, one example. Want to say is? I didn't get, uh. So, the thing is.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nI didn't get to exactly what you\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWere asking.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm. No, don't feel bad, telling me that you don't understand what I'm asking. I'm highly caffeinated, so I'm sure I'm talking too fast.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI again, this is. It's chill, um, so? What I basically want to know is. I,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI\n\n[Speaker 1]\nNeed to understand a time that you were like looking into a problem, right? And you realized that you didn't know what was going on right, and you needed to like, figure out you needed to learn a lot more in order to actually figure out what was happening in this situation. It could have been, you know, like there was a bug that you didn't know what was happening. It could be something like.\n\nHe didn't know anything about graphql, so you had to like dive in to figure out how that worked Kafka. For example, if you didn't know how it worked, but you needed to implement it. So, does that make more sense?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nOkay, so?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIf, uh, so the solution for this, I can say, is. Let me think of an example for this, uh? While working at Wells Fargo on backend microservices.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI can say Microservice for processing real-time banking transaction. So I noticed that some transactions for, uh, intermittently failing without clear Allen block logs. So this was very critical because?\n\nEver. A small failure rate could impact customer trust here, so the task was to identify the root cause and ensure the service can reliably without data loss. So, our failed transactions?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nInitially, I had no clear starting point, because, uh, the logs were awake here. And there were multiple upstreams and Downstream systems involved, right? So? Were begin, like replicating the issue in a lower environment and enabling detailed debug logging to capture more context. So, I learned more about how our Kafka event. Extremely work with the transaction microservices since I had. Previously. Uh, work in a management. So, and the thing is, uh, another one is, uh, I analyzed a message payloads and processing patterns and discovered this certain rate payloads always issue in the capital consumer. So, which wasn't being logged? So, I collaborated with the devops in to deploy enhanced logging to production for a short window. Uh, which confirmed the same issue in live traffic. So, uh, once I identified. A research.\n\nUh, and sorry, and implemented a fixed to handle the edge case. Gracefully, along with unit tests to prevent regressions. So, then the result was like a fixed registered failure transaction in that service from around two percent to zero percent. So I also updated a logging strategy to capture. Informato, as it details in future instance. So the incident became a knowledge sharing session for the team, so others could troubleshoot similar streaming issues more effectively. Yeah, that's. Think I can say,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll right, let's dive into that a little bit. So was the errors being thrown, and, and you'll have to excuse me if I didn't catch this? Was the errors being thrown? By Kafka, or was it inside of the compute for the Kafka consumers?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, I can say it was. Inside with the Kappa consumers.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, so the Kafka consumers were throwing the air. What kind of tech stack do the Kafka consumers run on top of?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo this? So I can say. So?\n\nExpect the use. I can say, like, uh, Kafka consumers are back and work like a Java 11. The users spring and? Uh, spring, springboard, and spring.\n\nSo, you asked about the text type only, right? Yeah, so, like\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThe the consumers, I understand, they're running Java spring boot, uh, their Java spring boot services, are they running? Like, what's the compute that they're running on top of? Is it a cloud consumers? It looks like you guys used AWS, but is it what is it running on top of?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUh.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo? At the top, I can say. I can say in that scenario. No AWS is said to instances running Docker containers like springboot microservices. Like, so, Computing this how it was done actually in some setup services, could also run on AWS cases. Clusters are hosted on AWS. Instead of just running them direct on Ely. Uh, then the setup, like the storage, is also like a processor, transaction, or data persisted in post SQL running. On AWS RDS artifacts locks that? Then also monitoring was done on cloudwatch for AWS level Matrix grafana and Prometheus first level Matrix and Kappa consumer of a log monitoring.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nOkay,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo either self managed Kafka on easy to Amazon. Amazon msk was used.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, so the Kafka itself was running on a managed ec2 instance, but the compute for the consumers were running on eks and Docker containers. Okay, so the eks Docker containers were where the logs were not getting read from because they wasn't proper error messaging. Right? So, what is the? What is the thing that you did in order to improve the error logging? Was it just? Was there an exception being thrown and nothing was being logged for it. Did you actually have to change the? Um, the logging strategy, where the log's not being published to cloudwatch at all, like, what was the actual solution to the problem?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, so exactly, uh?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhat\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI did to improve the error logging was? Was like to enable debugger, and it is logging here in spring cap. The configuration are temporarily for everything consumer group, so I would capture stack traces and method level of for failing messages. So, grab the message processing logic in a trade catch block, especially around the deceleration and transformation. All steps long,\n\n[Speaker 3]\nThe\n\n[Speaker 2]\nFull exception stack and Trace here. And the message header.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, so let me see if I understand correctly you. There was an exception that you could see in logs, but you couldn't root cause it. And so, what you did is you turned on the debugger. In production so that you could go ahead and get the full stack trace of what was going on. Right?\n\nIs that, am I understanding that? Okay, so? How did that work because usually when you attach a debugger to Java processes? It actually halts the process, right? So, like, was this, actually, the debugger being attached, or were you just having it dump extra logs?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo actually. Uh, I didn't get this actually one.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, the way Java did, yeah, Java debuggers generally stop. The process when it finds an exception, right? If you said debug points.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nRight? So\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYou, you said, debug points in a production environment?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYes, and then.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nBut didn't that impact? The customer whose call you stopped? With the debugger.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nOkay\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNow! I can say I'm actually a point, and so actually, when I said enabling, uh, deblogging, right, I meant like, uh, switching springboard? So, like on locker Kappa consumer classes, this is not interactive brother. It's just making application output, uh, much more. What logs so we can see the method, cause parameters, and stack traces without stopping the process. So, attaching a remote debug? Head to production. Can pass threats are caused by modes and impacts. SNS for customers like, not acceptable for banking transactions, so it also possess security issues, right? So, if the remote debugger Port is export? So, what I actually did in this case is, uh, updated kubernetes deployment, uh, to set a temporary logging configuration?\n\nAnd added a Target targeted logging. Inside the message processing or try catch so I could dump the exception by full stack price and nonsense to message metadata and deploy that content to production, or for a limited time, captured the logs in LK and rolled back into. Forward.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, so let me see if I understand he didn't actually attach a debugger. You turned on debug level, logging in your logger, and then you added additional debug logs to a try catch block. Understood. All right. So then? That way. There it was, not an interactive debugger. It was just a debug level logging. Understood yes? All right, that makes sense. And so. What did you learn from the the debug level logging you basically? You said you dumped the entire stack Trace out?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUm,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nDid you end up adding logs to the the service so that you could figure these things out in the future, but without having to go in and do debugging logging or is the is the standard operating procedure to go in and activate debug logging when you see issues?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, so. So I learned actually was like once I had the root cause, uh, no, I did. I did not want the team to have safely to debug everything, right? So some sometimes something they went wrong? So, what I did actually learn and change it from it? Is that relaying only on generic exceptions? Makes troubleshooting slow and reactive, right? So, debugging level logging in production should be the last, uh, shot here. So, not a standard practice because? It's noisy and can impact log injection, or like some storage cost. And then, I added, structured in full level locks in Kafka consumer error handling code. So now! Always capture exception type and messages, uh, the relevant message key odd headers. So, consumer group and partition like this. So, this way, we we get enough context from most future instance without needing to enable the debug right. So, like, uh? In guidelines for all our Kafka consumers and share it with the team. So now, every new consumer service must include. This contextual error logs by default, a debug logging in production is still possible, but only. Use temporary and deeper tracing is absolutely necessary. So, basically, from this, I held for a long term like improved or default logging. So, the next single book could be diagnated from normal info logs without extra steps.\n\nOkay.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI think it makes sense. All right, let's move on to the next question. Um. So, can you describe a time? When you needed to influence a peer who had a differing opinion about a shared goal.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, if you want me to tell time that I influenced it up here.\n\nSo, let me think of an example. So, uh, one example I can see is, uh, I can say at Wells Fargo only. Be here working on new feature for the customer dashboard that require integrating both rfql and rest kps. So, my PA billiard we would stick? The rest for Simplicity. While I felt that a hybrid approach like using graphql for complex Mr data. And rest. For a simpler input, it would be better. So the task what we needed to agree on API strategy here before starting implementation. Since both back and service contracts and front-end queries would depend on it. All that actions I took was, like, I first acknowledge my peers concerns about complexity and team learning with graphql, so I gathered metrics and real examples for our current rest endpoints are showing that fetching nested data often required three to four round trips. Words, so I have created a small proof of concept. Showing that some dashboards data fetching in my stream. So, we reviewed this side by side in a technical design meeting along with the trace trade-off in caching, error handling, and schema maintenance. So I propose the com, a compromise here, like, adopt a graphql for data, heavy composite queries. Uh, keep rest for single or resource endpoints. So, the result was the team agreed to hybrid model. This registered damage dashboard loads. Seconds, and by 30 percent while keeping implementation complexity are manageable. My peers? Later acknowledge that.\n\nAnd. I can say that seeing real performance gauge and clear maintenance plan help change their prospect too. So, in this case, this approach becomes the reference pattern for other types building complex customer facing UV components. Meant this, so I have learned that influencing peer isn't about winning an argument, right? It's just about finding common ground through data prototypes and help with their concerns.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nMakes sense. So, how did you alleviate? Wait, what were their main concerns? About graphql.\n\nSo, yeah, what were they?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay, so gracias consons or layer, so a constant and consensual so? There was. And we. Then there was a learning team for the team, right? So not everything was familiar with graphql queries, like a resolve and implementation. So they worried it. Uh, it would slow the team down at the start.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, like there\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWas an increased complexity. Actually, uh, setting up graphics or adds another layer on the.\n\nExisting resting processor, so we have. And there was a secure like there was some security Councils to here. So, specific endpoints are more flexible, but that means. They can potentially request more data than internet.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI'm definitely I'm very familiar with graphql, um. So, what was your did they not have any concerns over the long-term maintenance of maintaining both rest endpoints and graphql endpoints?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI can say, uh, when coming. Um. So? This part. And. The thing is, uh, one of the biggest concern. Uh, in one of my page. Maintenance and cost of supporting both rest and graph rank points. Their point was that over time, we could end up with duplicate logic in two different API layers, which could increase technical depth like required more regression testing and. Duplicate onboarding for new developers,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThey were also concerned about documentation here. If they understand the Rascal contracts, uh, we aren't keeping. So,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThen why, why use if the main concern is having two different Tech Stacks? Why was there an alternate option to just create, um, rest a rest endpoint specifically to solve the query patterns of the heavy doubt data? Quests, like, why did you need graphql instead of a bespoke rest API?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo I can say that.\n\nThe reason why? Editor was actually. There was actually. If the only multiple cost to get the needed data like, we could keep the stack purely restocurrency. Team might still choose graphql instead of only few recipes that are its flexibility, like lines can Define exactly what fields they need without back and\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHaving to\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCreate a new endpoint for every variant. And so. Like, instead of creating say like a customer details. And all these basically call these things can handle all those through a single schema graph. Yeah,\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSo is,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, the I understand the reason why you would want a graphql endpoint because you can just fetch whatever data you want. Not all of the data. But the point you made at the beginning was that you implemented it because it would allow you to reduce multiple round-trip calls, right? So, why did you not just create an API that would solve specifically? Um, that round trip call issue. Instead of implementing a new API layer, like, what was the, what was the key factor that said, no, we're not going to create an API specifically to solve this. We're going to create an entire layer, right? So, what was, what was that key factor?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo? We couldn't have a build a single. And I can say the thing is what I thought for this. Is? We weren't just have one fixture problem here. So our dashboards? Need change frequently? Because our product manager kept adding new combination of fields, filters, and related resources? If we, when we just restrain point for everybody, listen. We have ended up creating and maintaining multiple composite and endpoints over time, like repeating development, testing documentation, work every time. So with graphql, uh, we could just.\n\nAnd I can say that we were creating a new backend point every time there are a requirement. And Logics, uh, I can say the UA requirement shifted and give the backend knowledge centralized. While still reducing over fetching and under fetching, so deciding factor wasn't performance alone. It was long term adopority, I can say.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight. Okay, well, that's just. I guess that didn't come out when you were talking about it earlier. Um. Okay. Cool! Um. So, let's go ahead and move over to the, uh. Coding part of this. Do you have the Live code link?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYes, yes, I do have. Okay.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSorry,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nBen,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nNo worries.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nAre you\n\n[Speaker 1]\nGoing to be using, uh, JavaScript, today?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, Java,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nJava, okay?\n\nAll right.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nGive me one second.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nDigital,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYep, looks like you're in, oh. Kicked me out, God dang it! All right.\n\nSo, I pasted the prompt up here. Um. Go ahead and give it a read. Um.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nRepresents\n\n[Speaker 2]\nA question.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSo, we have\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAn array of seeds. Also, cities outwarded up, right? So, one represents.\n\nSo sleep is occupied and zero reference. It is empty.\n\nSo, what we can do is? For each seat, we can store the distance for the from the nearest ones to left side. If there are no? Right on the left? So you can keep it as Infinity or large number.\n\nSo, then one right, low lock now, so what we can do is? Uh, from each seat, we can store distance from nearest one. Right side. So again, if there is no one on the right? Uh, keep it as Infinity.\n\nSo command distance I can say for each mtcp 0. So, find the minimum of left distance and right distance, so that's the distance to the call closest person. Also the coolest person. We can drag the sheep that maximize the minimum distance.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay. Go ahead and coat it up.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nWhat\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWe can do is we can have a class now.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nI'm saying, like\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThe oblique.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nMaximize\n\n[Speaker 2]\nDistance.\n\nGlue just like this, you can say. Them. Inside this, we can have a method.\n\nYou can find.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSo, image.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nJust equals.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nYou\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCan sound like this.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nAnd what\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWill be like that?\n\nAnd last for. 2 divided equals minus.\n\nIt's done.\n\nIt's, it's not.\n\n[Speaker 3]\n+ 2.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWhat we can do is here. You don't need to have this.\n\n[Speaker 3]\n-1.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, fill right?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUm, find the best seat.\n\nSo,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNow what we can do is?\n\nUh, in this C, it is equals to minus 1. On Max distance equals to -1.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSheets of y\n\n[Speaker 2]\n=?\n\nSo, paying people? Support again.\n\nUh, yeah, it should work, I think.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll right. Let's take a look through it.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUm,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll right, so? Starting at line 21.22, so. Tell me about the things your initial initializing and why you're initializing them.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, the thing here? We store the number of seats.\n\nOkay, sure. Then, we we allocate two arrows arrays to pole, like, for each position on the distance to nearest top, quite seed on the left.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, the what is the left distance and right distance store?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, it allocates two arrows to hold.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nLike for each question. The distance for the distance to nearest occupied shade around itself.\n\nAnd, and right, for the right distance, okay, and it's\n\n[Speaker 1]\nFrom. So, like, what is the left distance is the distance from the last person?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSorry. And\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo the left distance array stores the distance from the last laughs person.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, the distance I can say from the last left person you are asking, or yes for\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThe for the left distance array. What it, what is it? What are the numbers that storing represent?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIt's gonna be. Get the story. Uh, represent is for the left distance array. It remains, like, how far is the close occupied the left, uh, including, like, uh, in my own position if it's occupied?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay. And what's the leftmost value going to be?\n\nSo, the\n\n[Speaker 2]\nLefts are most valuable. It's gonna be like? I can say here if you see. Now, the leftmost value will be like, uh, it's something like zero, I can say. Uh.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhy would the leftmost value be zero? Why would the leftmost value be zero?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, I understand.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, but why? Why is the leftmost value zero? I'm asking so. You said the leftmost value in the left distance array is going to be zero.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWhy is\n\n[Speaker 1]\nIt going to be zero?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThat's because. The index 0. But the city is occupied one, so just. Distance of the closest portion on the left is zero. Like, you are already sitting there.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight. So, if someone's sitting there, then it's zero.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, if someone sitting there, that's zero. Yeah, what if no one's\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSitting there?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo if nobody is sitting there, I can say the value gonna be. Uh, if we can say, there is. No one here occupied. Say to the left of the current position.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight. So then, what would the value be? So, the value\n\n[Speaker 2]\nGonna be like?\n\nIt will be the last large number, so no person found on the left, right?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSure.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo we can say the well, if nobody is there, we can mention it as Infinity.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, you usually n plus one. So, like, we use a larger number instead of mass.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay. Makes sense. All right now. Walk me through what the.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUm. The loop on line 27 does.\n\n7.7.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, uh, it's start scanning from the left length. So, see if the current seat is occupied. I'll update the last operator I and distance to Lost. To and discuss the left occupied CT 0, so. So, if the current state is empty, so the distance to the nearest left occupiest is, uh, is like a minus last one of the pipe. So, and if if none has been seen last, half point is minus infinity. So this becomes a large a very large number so effectively. You can say no left.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay. And so, what are you setting the values to if there's somebody sitting in the seat then?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo the values if somebody? Should be in the seat eyes. I can say.\n\nLike, we are storing like some in left to the right past. Now, we have lost occurate equals so far. Occupations left distance of five. We are having a zero, right? Also, we are having a zero in.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nIf there's a person in the seat, then it'll be a zero distance.\n\nAll right. So then? I think that makes sense, and then you're saying that the right to left is similar in the way it works. Correct?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, yes.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, so then walk me through what the loop on line 54 does.\n\n[Speaker 2]\n154, I can see.\n\nSo here, what happens is? If it gets over all c's to choose the best empty one.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight, how does it do that?\n\nBut how does it? How does it figure that out?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, so it only counts as entities. The thing is. So for?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI the distance to the closest person is the minimum of left and the right distance. And if the seat closed person distance? Is better than any scene so forth. If it is, so far, we can record it, right?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo then real quick? Can you show me what the? Um, the left array. And the right array would look like. For the example here. At the top. So, on line 13 and 14, if you could just fill those two in? For the example I gave you.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSo, you\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWant me to? I should do like?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI mean, you should be able to fill it out. By just the pseudo, you should know how the pseudocode works so you can just fill in these arrays for me so that I understand exactly what's going to be here. Right?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSo left, right\n\n[Speaker 2]\nPass? I can say.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSo\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIt could be zero.\n\nThen we have 51 - 0. Then I equals to 2 minus 4.\n\nRight equals to?\n\nSo, you want me to show how I got these values?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nNo, it makes sense. Um, can you do it again for? This array.\n\n[Speaker 2]\n0, 0, 1, 0.\n\nYeah,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh, you can start filling it in.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nPush, it will be 11.\n\nSo T - 0 and?\n\n0, {comma}, 1.\n\nAnd 8 minus 5 in V3.\n\nYou hear what TV can do is?\n\nAnd we have a -4.\n\nYeah, can you see this? Ben,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah. So what's the right? Answer in this scenario.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nGive me one second. I didn't hear your problem.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhat is that can be the answer?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo I can say. Both are right.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nBoth are right.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nYeah.\n\nSo?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhy is the best seat index zero?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI can say that.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSee.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYour code is, it is because of how the distance, uh. In left distance and right distance come out when you take. So interesting question math dot mean lab distance of I comma right distance of I?\n\nSo I can say, uh, let's check index 0 left distance of 0 equals to. Infinity. Uh, and right distance of 0 equals to 2 and\n\n[Speaker 3]\nThe\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNearest equation of math dot Min, uh, infinity comma to equation 2.\n\nThe max level distance is and both index 0 and index 7 have it. Uh, if you are? Is, then it will pick the first seat or then reaches the Mac resistance with season at zero.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo? I'm not asking why your code does, and I'm asking why you coded it to do that.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI\n\n[Speaker 3]\nCan say that.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThat we. That's what. We get. We get the best seat, right? So, if you want to pick the right most one in a time? So change greater than to greater than or equal to, or if you want.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYes, but okay, I'm just curious. I'm not curious about how I would change the code to make it happen. I'm just curious why that is the case. Like, why did we code it that way?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo?\n\nI can say that.\n\nGive me one second. Let me think about it.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, it's fine. I think we're actually out of time. Um,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI don't know. Give me a second.\n\nUh, I I'll finish the answer, uh, maybe it's happening. And the reason, it's correct. That's why we are actually tied to how we normally write. Is find Max Loops. So why fix index 0? I can say we start with Max distance equals to minus one. Uh, as soon as we find the nearest empty seat with the nearest bigger than Max distance RV update. So once, uh, we set math Christians to a certain value, uh, we never replace it. We see the same value again because the condition is greater than or not greater than or equals to. That means, uh, I can say the first ship that hits the max distance becomes based. Letter seeds have the same Max range, how we ignore them. So, why, if you ask me why it's correct the way as this, uh, the deliberate default choice, uh, in a lot of fine match problems? Speaking of first occurrence of the max respectable and awards extra time breaking walks.\n\nYeah, so\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYou'd basically just followed a standard fine Max that you, you already know how to code up.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYes, okay, that's right.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nCool, all right? Well, we are out of time.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWe are already actually technically over time. Is there any questions you have for me real quick before I go?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, okay. Did you work on, uh, any development that means any product development part?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nDid I ever do product development?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYes,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm, I have done a lot of product development. Yes, I've back in my time in Alexa in primary.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nHow did you gather the feedback from the customers if you? If you work on something that? Uh, that you, you're welcome.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHow do I gather feedback? Well, it depends on who my customers are. You know, key number one is to understand your customers. Um, so when I was in Prime air primarily, I would go talk to the maintenance technicians. I would just walk into their labs and bug them. For when I worked in Alexa. A lot of times, we had entire teams that were dedicated to going and collecting user feedback, uh, be it via surveys or consuming emails that people sent in about things that they didn't like. So, there it really does depend, but it is important that you figure out how to get in contact with your customers, no matter what it is that you're building.\n\nThanks, take it then. Yeah. Cool, all right. Well, good luck with the rest of your interviews. Thank you so much.\n\nOh my God.","numLines":751,"startLine":1,"totalLines":751}}}

My computer was muted.\n     9→\n    10→[Speaker 2]\n    11→Yeah.\n    12→\n    13→[Speaker 3]\n    14→All\n    15→\n    16→[Speaker 1]\n    17→Right. So, how's your day been so far?\n    18→\n    19→[Speaker 2]\n    20→It went very well, but the worst thing happened is, uh, before I have. I shared my mic, so that's why I didn't take the call. So, yeah, it's been a bit of worry for me, but I hope maybe he will take the call. Oh,\n    21→\n    22→[Speaker 1]\n    23→You, you were. You weren't able to make it to your first interview.\n    24→\n    25→[Speaker 2]\n    26→Yeah, yes,\n    27→\n    28→[Speaker 1]\n    29→Okay, don't worry about it. I'll, um. I'll ping the recruiter and make sure that they. They\n    30→\n    31→[Speaker 2]\n    32→Know what's\n    33→\n    34→[Speaker 1]\n    35→Going on?\n    36→\n    37→[Speaker 2]\n    38→Okay, let\n    39→\n    40→[Speaker 1]\n    41→Me let me do that for you. Real quick, um? So, just give me one second here.\n    42→\n    43→[Speaker 2]\n    44→Uh, okay. Hi, I'm a software engineer with around creation of experience designing and developing a scalable responsive applications. So, I specialize in react and rest graph apis and have good hands-on experience, are in Docker, kubernetes, and AWS, and building cicd pipelines to take care of from medium access and genius, so I can say, uh, I have strong background in oops, microservices, and real time. Even driven systems are using camera along with SQL, SQL, and no SQL databases, Etc.\n    45→\n    46→[Speaker 3]\n    47→Okay.\n    48→\n    49→[Speaker 1]\n    50→Cool. Thank you. Um, all right. So let me introduce myself, um? My name is Ben. Uh, I am a senior software developer at Amazon on the asbx golden path team. I've been in Amazon for about eight years. Um. While I've been in Amazon, I've been in a few different places, uh, I've gone from working on Alexa. To working on prime air. So, like the the Drone delivery program? To working on operator tooling to make you know operations that Amazon easier. And now I am. At the golden path team, where we kind of build out recommendations for how folks should be building microservices, async jobs, genai applications, Etc throughout the company. And then pushing on teams in order to build things that will allow them to actually have the recommended tool set to complete their jobs.\n    51→\n    52→Very broad. So? With that in mind. Yeah, so. Um, the way this is going to be working. I'm going to just be asking you a bunch of questions. Um, I'm going to save. We're going to basically go. We're gonna go through two different topics, and then about halfway through. I'm gonna go ahead and stop, and we're going to switch over, so I give you time to do the coding question.\n    53→\n    54→[Speaker 3]\n    55→Okay, um?\n    56→\n    57→[Speaker 1]\n    58→If you see if you hear me typing, um? That's just because my keyboard is loud, and I'm very sorry for that, um. But y'all. Also, I have you on the screen over here, and I have the second screen that I'm taking notes on over here. So I am paying attention. I'm just not looking at the camera.\n    59→\n    60→[Speaker 2]\n    61→Okay, cool, all right,\n    62→\n    63→[Speaker 1]\n    64→So? Let's go ahead and dive in. So, can you tell me about a time when you needed a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job well?\n    65→\n    66→[Speaker 2]\n    67→Uh, so, uh, if we think about situation, uh, one example. Want to say is? I didn't get, uh. So, the thing is.\n    68→\n    69→[Speaker 3]\n    70→I didn't get to exactly what you\n    71→\n    72→[Speaker 2]\n    73→Were asking.\n    74→\n    75→[Speaker 1]\n    76→Um. No, don't feel bad, telling me that you don't understand what I'm asking. I'm highly caffeinated, so I'm sure I'm talking too fast.\n    77→\n    78→[Speaker 2]\n    79→Um,\n    80→\n    81→[Speaker 1]\n    82→I again, this is. It's chill, um, so? What I basically want to know is. I,\n    83→\n    84→[Speaker 2]\n    85→I\n    86→\n    87→[Speaker 1]\n    88→Need to understand a time that you were like looking into a problem, right? And you realized that you didn't know what was going on right, and you needed to like, figure out you needed to learn a lot more in order to actually figure out what was happening in this situation. It could have been, you know, like there was a bug that you didn't know what was happening. It could be something like.\n    89→\n    90→He didn't know anything about graphql, so you had to like dive in to figure out how that worked Kafka. For example, if you didn't know how it worked, but you needed to implement it. So, does that make more sense?\n    91→\n    92→[Speaker 2]\n    93→Yeah, that makes sense.\n    94→\n    95→[Speaker 3]\n    96→Okay, so?\n    97→\n    98→[Speaker 1]\n    99→Uh,\n   100→\n   101→[Speaker 2]\n   102→If, uh, so the solution for this, I can say, is. Let me think of an example for this, uh? While working at Wells Fargo on backend microservices.\n   103→\n   104→[Speaker 1]\n   105→Uh,\n   106→\n   107→[Speaker 2]\n   108→I can say Microservice for processing real-time banking transaction. So I noticed that some transactions for, uh, intermittently failing without clear Allen block logs. So this was very critical because?\n   109→\n   110→Ever. A small failure rate could impact customer trust here, so the task was to identify the root cause and ensure the service can reliably without data loss. So, our failed transactions?\n   111→\n   112→[Speaker 1]\n   113→So,\n   114→\n   115→[Speaker 2]\n   116→Initially, I had no clear starting point, because, uh, the logs were awake here. And there were multiple upstreams and Downstream systems involved, right? So? Were begin, like replicating the issue in a lower environment and enabling detailed debug logging to capture more context. So, I learned more about how our Kafka event. Extremely work with the transaction microservices since I had. Previously. Uh, work in a management. So, and the thing is, uh, another one is, uh, I analyzed a message payloads and processing patterns and discovered this certain rate payloads always issue in the capital consumer. So, which wasn't being logged? So, I collaborated with the devops in to deploy enhanced logging to production for a short window. Uh, which confirmed the same issue in live traffic. So, uh, once I identified. A research.\n   117→\n   118→Uh, and sorry, and implemented a fixed to handle the edge case. Gracefully, along with unit tests to prevent regressions. So, then the result was like a fixed registered failure transaction in that service from around two percent to zero percent. So I also updated a logging strategy to capture. Informato, as it details in future instance. So the incident became a knowledge sharing session for the team, so others could troubleshoot similar streaming issues more effectively. Yeah, that's. Think I can say,\n   119→\n   120→[Speaker 1]\n   121→All right, let's dive into that a little bit. So was the errors being thrown, and, and you'll have to excuse me if I didn't catch this? Was the errors being thrown? By Kafka, or was it inside of the compute for the Kafka consumers?\n   122→\n   123→[Speaker 2]\n   124→Uh, I can say it was. Inside with the Kappa consumers.\n   125→\n   126→[Speaker 1]\n   127→Okay, so the Kafka consumers were throwing the air. What kind of tech stack do the Kafka consumers run on top of?\n   128→\n   129→[Speaker 2]\n   130→So this? So I can say. So?\n   131→\n   132→Expect the use. I can say, like, uh, Kafka consumers are back and work like a Java 11. The users spring and? Uh, spring, springboard, and spring.\n   133→\n   134→So, you asked about the text type only, right? Yeah, so, like\n   135→\n   136→[Speaker 1]\n   137→The the consumers, I understand, they're running Java spring boot, uh, their Java spring boot services, are they running? Like, what's the compute that they're running on top of? Is it a cloud consumers? It looks like you guys used AWS, but is it what is it running on top of?\n   138→\n   139→[Speaker 3]\n   140→Uh.\n   141→\n   142→[Speaker 2]\n   143→So? At the top, I can say. I can say in that scenario. No AWS is said to instances running Docker containers like springboot microservices. Like, so, Computing this how it was done actually in some setup services, could also run on AWS cases. Clusters are hosted on AWS. Instead of just running them direct on Ely. Uh, then the setup, like the storage, is also like a processor, transaction, or data persisted in post SQL running. On AWS RDS artifacts locks that? Then also monitoring was done on cloudwatch for AWS level Matrix grafana and Prometheus first level Matrix and Kappa consumer of a log monitoring.\n   144→\n   145→[Speaker 3]\n   146→Okay,\n   147→\n   148→[Speaker 2]\n   149→So either self managed Kafka on easy to Amazon. Amazon msk was used.\n   150→\n   151→[Speaker 1]\n   152→Okay, so the Kafka itself was running on a managed ec2 instance, but the compute for the consumers were running on eks and Docker containers. Okay, so the eks Docker containers were where the logs were not getting read from because they wasn't proper error messaging. Right? So, what is the? What is the thing that you did in order to improve the error logging? Was it just? Was there an exception being thrown and nothing was being logged for it. Did you actually have to change the? Um, the logging strategy, where the log's not being published to cloudwatch at all, like, what was the actual solution to the problem?\n   153→\n   154→[Speaker 2]\n   155→So, so exactly, uh?\n   156→\n   157→[Speaker 1]\n   158→What\n   159→\n   160→[Speaker 2]\n   161→I did to improve the error logging was? Was like to enable debugger, and it is logging here in spring cap. The configuration are temporarily for everything consumer group, so I would capture stack traces and method level of for failing messages. So, grab the message processing logic in a trade catch block, especially around the deceleration and transformation. All steps long,\n   162→\n   163→[Speaker 3]\n   164→The\n   165→\n   166→[Speaker 2]\n   167→Full exception stack and Trace here. And the message header.\n   168→\n   169→[Speaker 1]\n   170→So, so let me see if I understand correctly you. There was an exception that you could see in logs, but you couldn't root cause it. And so, what you did is you turned on the debugger. In production so that you could go ahead and get the full stack trace of what was going on. Right?\n   171→\n   172→Is that, am I understanding that? Okay, so? How did that work because usually when you attach a debugger to Java processes? It actually halts the process, right? So, like, was this, actually, the debugger being attached, or were you just having it dump extra logs?\n   173→\n   174→[Speaker 2]\n   175→So actually. Uh, I didn't get this actually one.\n   176→\n   177→[Speaker 1]\n   178→So, the way Java did, yeah, Java debuggers generally stop. The process when it finds an exception, right? If you said debug points.\n   179→\n   180→[Speaker 3]\n   181→Right? So\n   182→\n   183→[Speaker 1]\n   184→You, you said, debug points in a production environment?\n   185→\n   186→[Speaker 2]\n   187→Yes, and then.\n   188→\n   189→[Speaker 1]\n   190→But didn't that impact? The customer whose call you stopped? With the debugger.\n   191→\n   192→[Speaker 2]\n   193→So?\n   194→\n   195→[Speaker 3]\n   196→Okay\n   197→\n   198→[Speaker 2]\n   199→Now! I can say I'm actually a point, and so actually, when I said enabling, uh, deblogging, right, I meant like, uh, switching springboard? So, like on locker Kappa consumer classes, this is not interactive brother. It's just making application output, uh, much more. What logs so we can see the method, cause parameters, and stack traces without stopping the process. So, attaching a remote debug? Head to production. Can pass threats are caused by modes and impacts. SNS for customers like, not acceptable for banking transactions, so it also possess security issues, right? So, if the remote debugger Port is export? So, what I actually did in this case is, uh, updated kubernetes deployment, uh, to set a temporary logging configuration?\n   200→\n   201→And added a Target targeted logging. Inside the message processing or try catch so I could dump the exception by full stack price and nonsense to message metadata and deploy that content to production, or for a limited time, captured the logs in LK and rolled back into. Forward.\n   202→\n   203→[Speaker 1]\n   204→So, so let me see if I understand he didn't actually attach a debugger. You turned on debug level, logging in your logger, and then you added additional debug logs to a try catch block. Understood. All right. So then? That way. There it was, not an interactive debugger. It was just a debug level logging. Understood yes? All right, that makes sense. And so. What did you learn from the the debug level logging you basically? You said you dumped the entire stack Trace out?\n   205→\n   206→[Speaker 3]\n   207→Um,\n   208→\n   209→[Speaker 1]\n   210→Did you end up adding logs to the the service so that you could figure these things out in the future, but without having to go in and do debugging logging or is the is the standard operating procedure to go in and activate debug logging when you see issues?\n   211→\n   212→[Speaker 2]\n   213→Uh, so. So I learned actually was like once I had the root cause, uh, no, I did. I did not want the team to have safely to debug everything, right? So some sometimes something they went wrong? So, what I did actually learn and change it from it? Is that relaying only on generic exceptions? Makes troubleshooting slow and reactive, right? So, debugging level logging in production should be the last, uh, shot here. So, not a standard practice because? It's noisy and can impact log injection, or like some storage cost. And then, I added, structured in full level locks in Kafka consumer error handling code. So now! Always capture exception type and messages, uh, the relevant message key odd headers. So, consumer group and partition like this. So, this way, we we get enough context from most future instance without needing to enable the debug right. So, like, uh? In guidelines for all our Kafka consumers and share it with the team. So now, every new consumer service must include. This contextual error logs by default, a debug logging in production is still possible, but only. Use temporary and deeper tracing is absolutely necessary. So, basically, from this, I held for a long term like improved or default logging. So, the next single book could be diagnated from normal info logs without extra steps.\n   214→\n   215→Okay.\n   216→\n   217→[Speaker 1]\n   218→I think it makes sense. All right, let's move on to the next question. Um. So, can you describe a time? When you needed to influence a peer who had a differing opinion about a shared goal.\n   219→\n   220→[Speaker 2]\n   221→So, if you want me to tell time that I influenced it up here.\n   222→\n   223→So, let me think of an example. So, uh, one example I can see is, uh, I can say at Wells Fargo only. Be here working on new feature for the customer dashboard that require integrating both rfql and rest kps. So, my PA billiard we would stick? The rest for Simplicity. While I felt that a hybrid approach like using graphql for complex Mr data. And rest. For a simpler input, it would be better. So the task what we needed to agree on API strategy here before starting implementation. Since both back and service contracts and front-end queries would depend on it. All that actions I took was, like, I first acknowledge my peers concerns about complexity and team learning with graphql, so I gathered metrics and real examples for our current rest endpoints are showing that fetching nested data often required three to four round trips. Words, so I have created a small proof of concept. Showing that some dashboards data fetching in my stream. So, we reviewed this side by side in a technical design meeting along with the trace trade-off in caching, error handling, and schema maintenance. So I propose the com, a compromise here, like, adopt a graphql for data, heavy composite queries. Uh, keep rest for single or resource endpoints. So, the result was the team agreed to hybrid model. This registered damage dashboard loads. Seconds, and by 30 percent while keeping implementation complexity are manageable. My peers? Later acknowledge that.\n   224→\n   225→And. I can say that seeing real performance gauge and clear maintenance plan help change their prospect too. So, in this case, this approach becomes the reference pattern for other types building complex customer facing UV components. Meant this, so I have learned that influencing peer isn't about winning an argument, right? It's just about finding common ground through data prototypes and help with their concerns.\n   226→\n   227→[Speaker 1]\n   228→Makes sense. So, how did you alleviate? Wait, what were their main concerns? About graphql.\n   229→\n   230→So, yeah, what were they?\n   231→\n   232→[Speaker 2]\n   233→Okay, so gracias consons or layer, so a constant and consensual so? There was. And we. Then there was a learning team for the team, right? So not everything was familiar with graphql queries, like a resolve and implementation. So they worried it. Uh, it would slow the team down at the start.\n   234→\n   235→[Speaker 1]\n   236→Okay, like there\n   237→\n   238→[Speaker 2]\n   239→Was an increased complexity. Actually, uh, setting up graphics or adds another layer on the.\n   240→\n   241→Existing resting processor, so we have. And there was a secure like there was some security Councils to here. So, specific endpoints are more flexible, but that means. They can potentially request more data than internet.\n   242→\n   243→[Speaker 1]\n   244→I'm definitely I'm very familiar with graphql, um. So, what was your did they not have any concerns over the long-term maintenance of maintaining both rest endpoints and graphql endpoints?\n   245→\n   246→[Speaker 2]\n   247→I can say, uh, when coming. Um. So? This part. And. The thing is, uh, one of the biggest concern. Uh, in one of my page. Maintenance and cost of supporting both rest and graph rank points. Their point was that over time, we could end up with duplicate logic in two different API layers, which could increase technical depth like required more regression testing and. Duplicate onboarding for new developers,\n   248→\n   249→[Speaker 1]\n   250→So\n   251→\n   252→[Speaker 2]\n   253→They were also concerned about documentation here. If they understand the Rascal contracts, uh, we aren't keeping. So,\n   254→\n   255→[Speaker 1]\n   256→Then why, why use if the main concern is having two different Tech Stacks? Why was there an alternate option to just create, um, rest a rest endpoint specifically to solve the query patterns of the heavy doubt data? Quests, like, why did you need graphql instead of a bespoke rest API?\n   257→\n   258→[Speaker 2]\n   259→So I can say that.\n   260→\n   261→The reason why? Editor was actually. There was actually. If the only multiple cost to get the needed data like, we could keep the stack purely restocurrency. Team might still choose graphql instead of only few recipes that are its flexibility, like lines can Define exactly what fields they need without back and\n   262→\n   263→[Speaker 1]\n   264→Having to\n   265→\n   266→[Speaker 2]\n   267→Create a new endpoint for every variant. And so. Like, instead of creating say like a customer details. And all these basically call these things can handle all those through a single schema graph. Yeah,\n   268→\n   269→[Speaker 3]\n   270→So is,\n   271→\n   272→[Speaker 2]\n   273→Yeah.\n   274→\n   275→[Speaker 1]\n   276→So, the I understand the reason why you would want a graphql endpoint because you can just fetch whatever data you want. Not all of the data. But the point you made at the beginning was that you implemented it because it would allow you to reduce multiple round-trip calls, right? So, why did you not just create an API that would solve specifically? Um, that round trip call issue. Instead of implementing a new API layer, like, what was the, what was the key factor that said, no, we're not going to create an API specifically to solve this. We're going to create an entire layer, right? So, what was, what was that key factor?\n   277→\n   278→[Speaker 2]\n   279→So? We couldn't have a build a single. And I can say the thing is what I thought for this. Is? We weren't just have one fixture problem here. So our dashboards? Need change frequently? Because our product manager kept adding new combination of fields, filters, and related resources? If we, when we just restrain point for everybody, listen. We have ended up creating and maintaining multiple composite and endpoints over time, like repeating development, testing documentation, work every time. So with graphql, uh, we could just.\n   280→\n   281→And I can say that we were creating a new backend point every time there are a requirement. And Logics, uh, I can say the UA requirement shifted and give the backend knowledge centralized. While still reducing over fetching and under fetching, so deciding factor wasn't performance alone. It was long term adopority, I can say.\n   282→\n   283→[Speaker 1]\n   284→Right. Okay, well, that's just. I guess that didn't come out when you were talking about it earlier. Um. Okay. Cool! Um. So, let's go ahead and move over to the, uh. Coding part of this. Do you have the Live code link?\n   285→\n   286→[Speaker 2]\n   287→Yes, yes, I do have. Okay.\n   288→\n   289→[Speaker 1]\n   290→Um.\n   291→\n   292→[Speaker 3]\n   293→Sorry,\n   294→\n   295→[Speaker 2]\n   296→Ben,\n   297→\n   298→[Speaker 1]\n   299→No worries.\n   300→\n   301→[Speaker 3]\n   302→Are you\n   303→\n   304→[Speaker 1]\n   305→Going to be using, uh, JavaScript, today?\n   306→\n   307→[Speaker 2]\n   308→Uh, Java,\n   309→\n   310→[Speaker 1]\n   311→Java, okay?\n   312→\n   313→All right.\n   314→\n   315→[Speaker 2]\n   316→Give me one second.\n   317→\n   318→[Speaker 3]\n   319→Digital,\n   320→\n   321→[Speaker 2]\n   322→Okay?\n   323→\n   324→[Speaker 1]\n   325→Yep, looks like you're in, oh. Kicked me out, God dang it! All right.\n   326→\n   327→So, I pasted the prompt up here. Um. Go ahead and give it a read. Um.\n   328→\n   329→[Speaker 3]\n   330→Represents\n   331→\n   332→[Speaker 2]\n   333→A question.\n   334→\n   335→[Speaker 3]\n   336→So, we have\n   337→\n   338→[Speaker 2]\n   339→An array of seeds. Also, cities outwarded up, right? So, one represents.\n   340→\n   341→So sleep is occupied and zero reference. It is empty.\n   342→\n   343→So, what we can do is? For each seat, we can store the distance for the from the nearest ones to left side. If there are no? Right on the left? So you can keep it as Infinity or large number.\n   344→\n   345→So, then one right, low lock now, so what we can do is? Uh, from each seat, we can store distance from nearest one. Right side. So again, if there is no one on the right? Uh, keep it as Infinity.\n   346→\n   347→So command distance I can say for each mtcp 0. So, find the minimum of left distance and right distance, so that's the distance to the call closest person. Also the coolest person. We can drag the sheep that maximize the minimum distance.\n   348→\n   349→[Speaker 1]\n   350→Okay. Go ahead and coat it up.\n   351→\n   352→[Speaker 3]\n   353→What\n   354→\n   355→[Speaker 2]\n   356→We can do is we can have a class now.\n   357→\n   358→[Speaker 3]\n   359→I'm saying, like\n   360→\n   361→[Speaker 2]\n   362→The oblique.\n   363→\n   364→[Speaker 3]\n   365→Maximize\n   366→\n   367→[Speaker 2]\n   368→Distance.\n   369→\n   370→Glue just like this, you can say. Them. Inside this, we can have a method.\n   371→\n   372→You can find.\n   373→\n   374→[Speaker 3]\n   375→So, image.\n   376→\n   377→[Speaker 2]\n   378→Just equals.\n   379→\n   380→[Speaker 3]\n   381→You\n   382→\n   383→[Speaker 2]\n   384→Can sound like this.\n   385→\n   386→[Speaker 3]\n   387→And what\n   388→\n   389→[Speaker 2]\n   390→Will be like that?\n   391→\n   392→And last for. 2 divided equals minus.\n   393→\n   394→It's done.\n   395→\n   396→It's, it's not.\n   397→\n   398→[Speaker 3]\n   399→+ 2.\n   400→\n   401→[Speaker 2]\n   402→What we can do is here. You don't need to have this.\n   403→\n   404→[Speaker 3]\n   405→-1.\n   406→\n   407→[Speaker 2]\n   408→So, fill right?\n   409→\n   410→[Speaker 3]\n   411→Um, find the best seat.\n   412→\n   413→So,\n   414→\n   415→[Speaker 2]\n   416→Now what we can do is?\n   417→\n   418→Uh, in this C, it is equals to minus 1. On Max distance equals to -1.\n   419→\n   420→[Speaker 3]\n   421→Sheets of y\n   422→\n   423→[Speaker 2]\n   424→=?\n   425→\n   426→So, paying people? Support again.\n   427→\n   428→Uh, yeah, it should work, I think.\n   429→\n   430→[Speaker 1]\n   431→All right. Let's take a look through it.\n   432→\n   433→[Speaker 3]\n   434→Um,\n   435→\n   436→[Speaker 1]\n   437→All right, so? Starting at line 21.22, so. Tell me about the things your initial initializing and why you're initializing them.\n   438→\n   439→[Speaker 2]\n   440→So, the thing here? We store the number of seats.\n   441→\n   442→Okay, sure. Then, we we allocate two arrows arrays to pole, like, for each position on the distance to nearest top, quite seed on the left.\n   443→\n   444→[Speaker 1]\n   445→So, the what is the left distance and right distance store?\n   446→\n   447→[Speaker 2]\n   448→Uh, it allocates two arrows to hold.\n   449→\n   450→[Speaker 1]\n   451→Yeah.\n   452→\n   453→[Speaker 2]\n   454→Like for each question. The distance for the distance to nearest occupied shade around itself.\n   455→\n   456→And, and right, for the right distance, okay, and it's\n   457→\n   458→[Speaker 1]\n   459→From. So, like, what is the left distance is the distance from the last person?\n   460→\n   461→[Speaker 2]\n   462→Sorry. And\n   463→\n   464→[Speaker 1]\n   465→So the left distance array stores the distance from the last laughs person.\n   466→\n   467→[Speaker 2]\n   468→Uh, the distance I can say from the last left person you are asking, or yes for\n   469→\n   470→[Speaker 1]\n   471→The for the left distance array. What it, what is it? What are the numbers that storing represent?\n   472→\n   473→[Speaker 2]\n   474→It's gonna be. Get the story. Uh, represent is for the left distance array. It remains, like, how far is the close occupied the left, uh, including, like, uh, in my own position if it's occupied?\n   475→\n   476→[Speaker 1]\n   477→Okay. And what's the leftmost value going to be?\n   478→\n   479→So, the\n   480→\n   481→[Speaker 2]\n   482→Lefts are most valuable. It's gonna be like? I can say here if you see. Now, the leftmost value will be like, uh, it's something like zero, I can say. Uh.\n   483→\n   484→[Speaker 1]\n   485→Why would the leftmost value be zero? Why would the leftmost value be zero?\n   486→\n   487→[Speaker 2]\n   488→Yeah, I understand.\n   489→\n   490→[Speaker 1]\n   491→Yeah, but why? Why is the leftmost value zero? I'm asking so. You said the leftmost value in the left distance array is going to be zero.\n   492→\n   493→[Speaker 2]\n   494→Why is\n   495→\n   496→[Speaker 1]\n   497→It going to be zero?\n   498→\n   499→[Speaker 2]\n   500→That's because. The index 0. But the city is occupied one, so just. Distance of the closest portion on the left is zero. Like, you are already sitting there.\n   501→\n   502→[Speaker 1]\n   503→Right. So, if someone's sitting there, then it's zero.\n   504→\n   505→[Speaker 2]\n   506→So, if someone sitting there, that's zero. Yeah, what if no one's\n   507→\n   508→[Speaker 1]\n   509→Sitting there?\n   510→\n   511→[Speaker 2]\n   512→So if nobody is sitting there, I can say the value gonna be. Uh, if we can say, there is. No one here occupied. Say to the left of the current position.\n   513→\n   514→[Speaker 1]\n   515→Right. So then, what would the value be? So, the value\n   516→\n   517→[Speaker 2]\n   518→Gonna be like?\n   519→\n   520→It will be the last large number, so no person found on the left, right?\n   521→\n   522→[Speaker 1]\n   523→Sure.\n   524→\n   525→[Speaker 2]\n   526→So we can say the well, if nobody is there, we can mention it as Infinity.\n   527→\n   528→[Speaker 1]\n   529→Okay.\n   530→\n   531→[Speaker 2]\n   532→So, you usually n plus one. So, like, we use a larger number instead of mass.\n   533→\n   534→[Speaker 1]\n   535→Okay. Makes sense. All right now. Walk me through what the.\n   536→\n   537→[Speaker 3]\n   538→Um. The loop on line 27 does.\n   539→\n   540→7.7.\n   541→\n   542→[Speaker 2]\n   543→So, uh, it's start scanning from the left length. So, see if the current seat is occupied. I'll update the last operator I and distance to Lost. To and discuss the left occupied CT 0, so. So, if the current state is empty, so the distance to the nearest left occupiest is, uh, is like a minus last one of the pipe. So, and if if none has been seen last, half point is minus infinity. So this becomes a large a very large number so effectively. You can say no left.\n   544→\n   545→[Speaker 1]\n   546→Okay. And so, what are you setting the values to if there's somebody sitting in the seat then?\n   547→\n   548→[Speaker 2]\n   549→So the values if somebody? Should be in the seat eyes. I can say.\n   550→\n   551→Like, we are storing like some in left to the right past. Now, we have lost occurate equals so far. Occupations left distance of five. We are having a zero, right? Also, we are having a zero in.\n   552→\n   553→[Speaker 1]\n   554→If there's a person in the seat, then it'll be a zero distance.\n   555→\n   556→All right. So then? I think that makes sense, and then you're saying that the right to left is similar in the way it works. Correct?\n   557→\n   558→[Speaker 2]\n   559→Uh, yes.\n   560→\n   561→[Speaker 1]\n   562→Okay, so then walk me through what the loop on line 54 does.\n   563→\n   564→[Speaker 2]\n   565→154, I can see.\n   566→\n   567→So here, what happens is? If it gets over all c's to choose the best empty one.\n   568→\n   569→[Speaker 1]\n   570→Right, how does it do that?\n   571→\n   572→But how does it? How does it figure that out?\n   573→\n   574→[Speaker 2]\n   575→Uh, so it only counts as entities. The thing is. So for?\n   576→\n   577→[Speaker 3]\n   578→Uh,\n   579→\n   580→[Speaker 2]\n   581→I the distance to the closest person is the minimum of left and the right distance. And if the seat closed person distance? Is better than any scene so forth. If it is, so far, we can record it, right?\n   582→\n   583→[Speaker 1]\n   584→So then real quick? Can you show me what the? Um, the left array. And the right array would look like. For the example here. At the top. So, on line 13 and 14, if you could just fill those two in? For the example I gave you.\n   585→\n   586→[Speaker 3]\n   587→So, you\n   588→\n   589→[Speaker 2]\n   590→Want me to? I should do like?\n   591→\n   592→[Speaker 1]\n   593→I mean, you should be able to fill it out. By just the pseudo, you should know how the pseudocode works so you can just fill in these arrays for me so that I understand exactly what's going to be here. Right?\n   594→\n   595→[Speaker 3]\n   596→So left, right\n   597→\n   598→[Speaker 2]\n   599→Pass? I can say.\n   600→\n   601→[Speaker 3]\n   602→So\n   603→\n   604→[Speaker 2]\n   605→It could be zero.\n   606→\n   607→Then we have 51 - 0. Then I equals to 2 minus 4.\n   608→\n   609→Right equals to?\n   610→\n   611→So, you want me to show how I got these values?\n   612→\n   613→[Speaker 1]\n   614→No, it makes sense. Um, can you do it again for? This array.\n   615→\n   616→[Speaker 2]\n   617→0, 0, 1, 0.\n   618→\n   619→Yeah,\n   620→\n   621→[Speaker 1]\n   622→Uh, you can start filling it in.\n   623→\n   624→[Speaker 2]\n   625→Push, it will be 11.\n   626→\n   627→So T - 0 and?\n   628→\n   629→0, {comma}, 1.\n   630→\n   631→And 8 minus 5 in V3.\n   632→\n   633→You hear what TV can do is?\n   634→\n   635→And we have a -4.\n   636→\n   637→Yeah, can you see this? Ben,\n   638→\n   639→[Speaker 1]\n   640→Yeah. So what's the right? Answer in this scenario.\n   641→\n   642→[Speaker 3]\n   643→Uh,\n   644→\n   645→[Speaker 2]\n   646→Give me one second. I didn't hear your problem.\n   647→\n   648→[Speaker 1]\n   649→What is that can be the answer?\n   650→\n   651→[Speaker 2]\n   652→So I can say. Both are right.\n   653→\n   654→[Speaker 1]\n   655→Both are right.\n   656→\n   657→[Speaker 3]\n   658→Yeah.\n   659→\n   660→So?\n   661→\n   662→[Speaker 1]\n   663→Why is the best seat index zero?\n   664→\n   665→[Speaker 2]\n   666→I can say that.\n   667→\n   668→[Speaker 3]\n   669→See.\n   670→\n   671→[Speaker 2]\n   672→Your code is, it is because of how the distance, uh. In left distance and right distance come out when you take. So interesting question math dot mean lab distance of I comma right distance of I?\n   673→\n   674→So I can say, uh, let's check index 0 left distance of 0 equals to. Infinity. Uh, and right distance of 0 equals to 2 and\n   675→\n   676→[Speaker 3]\n   677→The\n   678→\n   679→[Speaker 2]\n   680→Nearest equation of math dot Min, uh, infinity comma to equation 2.\n   681→\n   682→The max level distance is and both index 0 and index 7 have it. Uh, if you are? Is, then it will pick the first seat or then reaches the Mac resistance with season at zero.\n   683→\n   684→[Speaker 1]\n   685→So? I'm not asking why your code does, and I'm asking why you coded it to do that.\n   686→\n   687→[Speaker 2]\n   688→I\n   689→\n   690→[Speaker 3]\n   691→Can say that.\n   692→\n   693→[Speaker 2]\n   694→That we. That's what. We get. We get the best seat, right? So, if you want to pick the right most one in a time? So change greater than to greater than or equal to, or if you want.\n   695→\n   696→[Speaker 1]\n   697→Yes, but okay, I'm just curious. I'm not curious about how I would change the code to make it happen. I'm just curious why that is the case. Like, why did we code it that way?\n   698→\n   699→[Speaker 2]\n   700→So?\n   701→\n   702→I can say that.\n   703→\n   704→Give me one second. Let me think about it.\n   705→\n   706→[Speaker 1]\n   707→Yeah, it's fine. I think we're actually out of time. Um,\n   708→\n   709→[Speaker 2]\n   710→I don't know. Give me a second.\n   711→\n   712→Uh, I I'll finish the answer, uh, maybe it's happening. And the reason, it's correct. That's why we are actually tied to how we normally write. Is find Max Loops. So why fix index 0? I can say we start with Max distance equals to minus one. Uh, as soon as we find the nearest empty seat with the nearest bigger than Max distance RV update. So once, uh, we set math Christians to a certain value, uh, we never replace it. We see the same value again because the condition is greater than or not greater than or equals to. That means, uh, I can say the first ship that hits the max distance becomes based. Letter seeds have the same Max range, how we ignore them. So, why, if you ask me why it's correct the way as this, uh, the deliberate default choice, uh, in a lot of fine match problems? Speaking of first occurrence of the max respectable and awards extra time breaking walks.\n   713→\n   714→Yeah, so\n   715→\n   716→[Speaker 1]\n   717→You'd basically just followed a standard fine Max that you, you already know how to code up.\n   718→\n   719→[Speaker 2]\n   720→Yes, okay, that's right.\n   721→\n   722→[Speaker 1]\n   723→Cool, all right? Well, we are out of time.\n   724→\n   725→[Speaker 2]\n   726→Um,\n   727→\n   728→[Speaker 1]\n   729→We are already actually technically over time. Is there any questions you have for me real quick before I go?\n   730→\n   731→[Speaker 2]\n   732→Uh, okay. Did you work on, uh, any development that means any product development part?\n   733→\n   734→[Speaker 1]\n   735→Did I ever do product development?\n   736→\n   737→[Speaker 2]\n   738→Yes,\n   739→\n   740→[Speaker 1]\n   741→Um, I have done a lot of product development. Yes, I've back in my time in Alexa in primary.\n   742→\n   743→[Speaker 2]\n   744→How did you gather the feedback from the customers if you? If you work on something that? Uh, that you, you're welcome.\n   745→\n   746→[Speaker 1]\n   747→How do I gather feedback? Well, it depends on who my customers are. You know, key number one is to understand your customers. Um, so when I was in Prime air primarily, I would go talk to the maintenance technicians. I would just walk into their labs and bug them. For when I worked in Alexa. A lot of times, we had entire teams that were dedicated to going and collecting user feedback, uh, be it via surveys or consuming emails that people sent in about things that they didn't like. So, there it really does depend, but it is important that you figure out how to get in contact with your customers, no matter what it is that you're building.\n   748→\n   749→Thanks, take it then. Yeah. Cool, all right. Well, good luck with the rest of your interviews. Thank you so much.\n   750→\n   751→Oh my God.\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious.

My computer was muted.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nAll\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight. So, how's your day been so far?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIt went very well, but the worst thing happened is, uh, before I have. I shared my mic, so that's why I didn't take the call. So, yeah, it's been a bit of worry for me, but I hope maybe he will take the call. Oh,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYou, you were. You weren't able to make it to your first interview.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, yes,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, don't worry about it. I'll, um. I'll ping the recruiter and make sure that they. They\n\n[Speaker 2]\nKnow what's\n\n[Speaker 1]\nGoing on?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay, let\n\n[Speaker 1]\nMe let me do that for you. Real quick, um? So, just give me one second here.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, okay. Hi, I'm a software engineer with around creation of experience designing and developing a scalable responsive applications. So, I specialize in react and rest graph apis and have good hands-on experience, are in Docker, kubernetes, and AWS, and building cicd pipelines to take care of from medium access and genius, so I can say, uh, I have strong background in oops, microservices, and real time. Even driven systems are using camera along with SQL, SQL, and no SQL databases, Etc.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nOkay.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nCool. Thank you. Um, all right. So let me introduce myself, um? My name is Ben. Uh, I am a senior software developer at Amazon on the asbx golden path team. I've been in Amazon for about eight years. Um. While I've been in Amazon, I've been in a few different places, uh, I've gone from working on Alexa. To working on prime air. So, like the the Drone delivery program? To working on operator tooling to make you know operations that Amazon easier. And now I am. At the golden path team, where we kind of build out recommendations for how folks should be building microservices, async jobs, genai applications, Etc throughout the company. And then pushing on teams in order to build things that will allow them to actually have the recommended tool set to complete their jobs.\n\nVery broad. So? With that in mind. Yeah, so. Um, the way this is going to be working. I'm going to just be asking you a bunch of questions. Um, I'm going to save. We're going to basically go. We're gonna go through two different topics, and then about halfway through. I'm gonna go ahead and stop, and we're going to switch over, so I give you time to do the coding question.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nOkay, um?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nIf you see if you hear me typing, um? That's just because my keyboard is loud, and I'm very sorry for that, um. But y'all. Also, I have you on the screen over here, and I have the second screen that I'm taking notes on over here. So I am paying attention. I'm just not looking at the camera.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay, cool, all right,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo? Let's go ahead and dive in. So, can you tell me about a time when you needed a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job well?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, so, uh, if we think about situation, uh, one example. Want to say is? I didn't get, uh. So, the thing is.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nI didn't get to exactly what you\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWere asking.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm. No, don't feel bad, telling me that you don't understand what I'm asking. I'm highly caffeinated, so I'm sure I'm talking too fast.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI again, this is. It's chill, um, so? What I basically want to know is. I,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI\n\n[Speaker 1]\nNeed to understand a time that you were like looking into a problem, right? And you realized that you didn't know what was going on right, and you needed to like, figure out you needed to learn a lot more in order to actually figure out what was happening in this situation. It could have been, you know, like there was a bug that you didn't know what was happening. It could be something like.\n\nHe didn't know anything about graphql, so you had to like dive in to figure out how that worked Kafka. For example, if you didn't know how it worked, but you needed to implement it. So, does that make more sense?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nOkay, so?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIf, uh, so the solution for this, I can say, is. Let me think of an example for this, uh? While working at Wells Fargo on backend microservices.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI can say Microservice for processing real-time banking transaction. So I noticed that some transactions for, uh, intermittently failing without clear Allen block logs. So this was very critical because?\n\nEver. A small failure rate could impact customer trust here, so the task was to identify the root cause and ensure the service can reliably without data loss. So, our failed transactions?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nInitially, I had no clear starting point, because, uh, the logs were awake here. And there were multiple upstreams and Downstream systems involved, right? So? Were begin, like replicating the issue in a lower environment and enabling detailed debug logging to capture more context. So, I learned more about how our Kafka event. Extremely work with the transaction microservices since I had. Previously. Uh, work in a management. So, and the thing is, uh, another one is, uh, I analyzed a message payloads and processing patterns and discovered this certain rate payloads always issue in the capital consumer. So, which wasn't being logged? So, I collaborated with the devops in to deploy enhanced logging to production for a short window. Uh, which confirmed the same issue in live traffic. So, uh, once I identified. A research.\n\nUh, and sorry, and implemented a fixed to handle the edge case. Gracefully, along with unit tests to prevent regressions. So, then the result was like a fixed registered failure transaction in that service from around two percent to zero percent. So I also updated a logging strategy to capture. Informato, as it details in future instance. So the incident became a knowledge sharing session for the team, so others could troubleshoot similar streaming issues more effectively. Yeah, that's. Think I can say,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll right, let's dive into that a little bit. So was the errors being thrown, and, and you'll have to excuse me if I didn't catch this? Was the errors being thrown? By Kafka, or was it inside of the compute for the Kafka consumers?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, I can say it was. Inside with the Kappa consumers.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, so the Kafka consumers were throwing the air. What kind of tech stack do the Kafka consumers run on top of?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo this? So I can say. So?\n\nExpect the use. I can say, like, uh, Kafka consumers are back and work like a Java 11. The users spring and? Uh, spring, springboard, and spring.\n\nSo, you asked about the text type only, right? Yeah, so, like\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThe the consumers, I understand, they're running Java spring boot, uh, their Java spring boot services, are they running? Like, what's the compute that they're running on top of? Is it a cloud consumers? It looks like you guys used AWS, but is it what is it running on top of?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUh.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo? At the top, I can say. I can say in that scenario. No AWS is said to instances running Docker containers like springboot microservices. Like, so, Computing this how it was done actually in some setup services, could also run on AWS cases. Clusters are hosted on AWS. Instead of just running them direct on Ely. Uh, then the setup, like the storage, is also like a processor, transaction, or data persisted in post SQL running. On AWS RDS artifacts locks that? Then also monitoring was done on cloudwatch for AWS level Matrix grafana and Prometheus first level Matrix and Kappa consumer of a log monitoring.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nOkay,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo either self managed Kafka on easy to Amazon. Amazon msk was used.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, so the Kafka itself was running on a managed ec2 instance, but the compute for the consumers were running on eks and Docker containers. Okay, so the eks Docker containers were where the logs were not getting read from because they wasn't proper error messaging. Right? So, what is the? What is the thing that you did in order to improve the error logging? Was it just? Was there an exception being thrown and nothing was being logged for it. Did you actually have to change the? Um, the logging strategy, where the log's not being published to cloudwatch at all, like, what was the actual solution to the problem?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, so exactly, uh?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhat\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI did to improve the error logging was? Was like to enable debugger, and it is logging here in spring cap. The configuration are temporarily for everything consumer group, so I would capture stack traces and method level of for failing messages. So, grab the message processing logic in a trade catch block, especially around the deceleration and transformation. All steps long,\n\n[Speaker 3]\nThe\n\n[Speaker 2]\nFull exception stack and Trace here. And the message header.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, so let me see if I understand correctly you. There was an exception that you could see in logs, but you couldn't root cause it. And so, what you did is you turned on the debugger. In production so that you could go ahead and get the full stack trace of what was going on. Right?\n\nIs that, am I understanding that? Okay, so? How did that work because usually when you attach a debugger to Java processes? It actually halts the process, right? So, like, was this, actually, the debugger being attached, or were you just having it dump extra logs?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo actually. Uh, I didn't get this actually one.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, the way Java did, yeah, Java debuggers generally stop. The process when it finds an exception, right? If you said debug points.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nRight? So\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYou, you said, debug points in a production environment?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYes, and then.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nBut didn't that impact? The customer whose call you stopped? With the debugger.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nOkay\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNow! I can say I'm actually a point, and so actually, when I said enabling, uh, deblogging, right, I meant like, uh, switching springboard? So, like on locker Kappa consumer classes, this is not interactive brother. It's just making application output, uh, much more. What logs so we can see the method, cause parameters, and stack traces without stopping the process. So, attaching a remote debug? Head to production. Can pass threats are caused by modes and impacts. SNS for customers like, not acceptable for banking transactions, so it also possess security issues, right? So, if the remote debugger Port is export? So, what I actually did in this case is, uh, updated kubernetes deployment, uh, to set a temporary logging configuration?\n\nAnd added a Target targeted logging. Inside the message processing or try catch so I could dump the exception by full stack price and nonsense to message metadata and deploy that content to production, or for a limited time, captured the logs in LK and rolled back into. Forward.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, so let me see if I understand he didn't actually attach a debugger. You turned on debug level, logging in your logger, and then you added additional debug logs to a try catch block. Understood. All right. So then? That way. There it was, not an interactive debugger. It was just a debug level logging. Understood yes? All right, that makes sense. And so. What did you learn from the the debug level logging you basically? You said you dumped the entire stack Trace out?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUm,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nDid you end up adding logs to the the service so that you could figure these things out in the future, but without having to go in and do debugging logging or is the is the standard operating procedure to go in and activate debug logging when you see issues?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, so. So I learned actually was like once I had the root cause, uh, no, I did. I did not want the team to have safely to debug everything, right? So some sometimes something they went wrong? So, what I did actually learn and change it from it? Is that relaying only on generic exceptions? Makes troubleshooting slow and reactive, right? So, debugging level logging in production should be the last, uh, shot here. So, not a standard practice because? It's noisy and can impact log injection, or like some storage cost. And then, I added, structured in full level locks in Kafka consumer error handling code. So now! Always capture exception type and messages, uh, the relevant message key odd headers. So, consumer group and partition like this. So, this way, we we get enough context from most future instance without needing to enable the debug right. So, like, uh? In guidelines for all our Kafka consumers and share it with the team. So now, every new consumer service must include. This contextual error logs by default, a debug logging in production is still possible, but only. Use temporary and deeper tracing is absolutely necessary. So, basically, from this, I held for a long term like improved or default logging. So, the next single book could be diagnated from normal info logs without extra steps.\n\nOkay.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI think it makes sense. All right, let's move on to the next question. Um. So, can you describe a time? When you needed to influence a peer who had a differing opinion about a shared goal.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, if you want me to tell time that I influenced it up here.\n\nSo, let me think of an example. So, uh, one example I can see is, uh, I can say at Wells Fargo only. Be here working on new feature for the customer dashboard that require integrating both rfql and rest kps. So, my PA billiard we would stick? The rest for Simplicity. While I felt that a hybrid approach like using graphql for complex Mr data. And rest. For a simpler input, it would be better. So the task what we needed to agree on API strategy here before starting implementation. Since both back and service contracts and front-end queries would depend on it. All that actions I took was, like, I first acknowledge my peers concerns about complexity and team learning with graphql, so I gathered metrics and real examples for our current rest endpoints are showing that fetching nested data often required three to four round trips. Words, so I have created a small proof of concept. Showing that some dashboards data fetching in my stream. So, we reviewed this side by side in a technical design meeting along with the trace trade-off in caching, error handling, and schema maintenance. So I propose the com, a compromise here, like, adopt a graphql for data, heavy composite queries. Uh, keep rest for single or resource endpoints. So, the result was the team agreed to hybrid model. This registered damage dashboard loads. Seconds, and by 30 percent while keeping implementation complexity are manageable. My peers? Later acknowledge that.\n\nAnd. I can say that seeing real performance gauge and clear maintenance plan help change their prospect too. So, in this case, this approach becomes the reference pattern for other types building complex customer facing UV components. Meant this, so I have learned that influencing peer isn't about winning an argument, right? It's just about finding common ground through data prototypes and help with their concerns.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nMakes sense. So, how did you alleviate? Wait, what were their main concerns? About graphql.\n\nSo, yeah, what were they?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay, so gracias consons or layer, so a constant and consensual so? There was. And we. Then there was a learning team for the team, right? So not everything was familiar with graphql queries, like a resolve and implementation. So they worried it. Uh, it would slow the team down at the start.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, like there\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWas an increased complexity. Actually, uh, setting up graphics or adds another layer on the.\n\nExisting resting processor, so we have. And there was a secure like there was some security Councils to here. So, specific endpoints are more flexible, but that means. They can potentially request more data than internet.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI'm definitely I'm very familiar with graphql, um. So, what was your did they not have any concerns over the long-term maintenance of maintaining both rest endpoints and graphql endpoints?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI can say, uh, when coming. Um. So? This part. And. The thing is, uh, one of the biggest concern. Uh, in one of my page. Maintenance and cost of supporting both rest and graph rank points. Their point was that over time, we could end up with duplicate logic in two different API layers, which could increase technical depth like required more regression testing and. Duplicate onboarding for new developers,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThey were also concerned about documentation here. If they understand the Rascal contracts, uh, we aren't keeping. So,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThen why, why use if the main concern is having two different Tech Stacks? Why was there an alternate option to just create, um, rest a rest endpoint specifically to solve the query patterns of the heavy doubt data? Quests, like, why did you need graphql instead of a bespoke rest API?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo I can say that.\n\nThe reason why? Editor was actually. There was actually. If the only multiple cost to get the needed data like, we could keep the stack purely restocurrency. Team might still choose graphql instead of only few recipes that are its flexibility, like lines can Define exactly what fields they need without back and\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHaving to\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCreate a new endpoint for every variant. And so. Like, instead of creating say like a customer details. And all these basically call these things can handle all those through a single schema graph. Yeah,\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSo is,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, the I understand the reason why you would want a graphql endpoint because you can just fetch whatever data you want. Not all of the data. But the point you made at the beginning was that you implemented it because it would allow you to reduce multiple round-trip calls, right? So, why did you not just create an API that would solve specifically? Um, that round trip call issue. Instead of implementing a new API layer, like, what was the, what was the key factor that said, no, we're not going to create an API specifically to solve this. We're going to create an entire layer, right? So, what was, what was that key factor?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo? We couldn't have a build a single. And I can say the thing is what I thought for this. Is? We weren't just have one fixture problem here. So our dashboards? Need change frequently? Because our product manager kept adding new combination of fields, filters, and related resources? If we, when we just restrain point for everybody, listen. We have ended up creating and maintaining multiple composite and endpoints over time, like repeating development, testing documentation, work every time. So with graphql, uh, we could just.\n\nAnd I can say that we were creating a new backend point every time there are a requirement. And Logics, uh, I can say the UA requirement shifted and give the backend knowledge centralized. While still reducing over fetching and under fetching, so deciding factor wasn't performance alone. It was long term adopority, I can say.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight. Okay, well, that's just. I guess that didn't come out when you were talking about it earlier. Um. Okay. Cool! Um. So, let's go ahead and move over to the, uh. Coding part of this. Do you have the Live code link?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYes, yes, I do have. Okay.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSorry,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nBen,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nNo worries.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nAre you\n\n[Speaker 1]\nGoing to be using, uh, JavaScript, today?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, Java,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nJava, okay?\n\nAll right.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nGive me one second.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nDigital,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYep, looks like you're in, oh. Kicked me out, God dang it! All right.\n\nSo, I pasted the prompt up here. Um. Go ahead and give it a read. Um.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nRepresents\n\n[Speaker 2]\nA question.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSo, we have\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAn array of seeds. Also, cities outwarded up, right? So, one represents.\n\nSo sleep is occupied and zero reference. It is empty.\n\nSo, what we can do is? For each seat, we can store the distance for the from the nearest ones to left side. If there are no? Right on the left? So you can keep it as Infinity or large number.\n\nSo, then one right, low lock now, so what we can do is? Uh, from each seat, we can store distance from nearest one. Right side. So again, if there is no one on the right? Uh, keep it as Infinity.\n\nSo command distance I can say for each mtcp 0. So, find the minimum of left distance and right distance, so that's the distance to the call closest person. Also the coolest person. We can drag the sheep that maximize the minimum distance.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay. Go ahead and coat it up.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nWhat\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWe can do is we can have a class now.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nI'm saying, like\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThe oblique.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nMaximize\n\n[Speaker 2]\nDistance.\n\nGlue just like this, you can say. Them. Inside this, we can have a method.\n\nYou can find.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSo, image.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nJust equals.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nYou\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCan sound like this.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nAnd what\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWill be like that?\n\nAnd last for. 2 divided equals minus.\n\nIt's done.\n\nIt's, it's not.\n\n[Speaker 3]\n+ 2.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWhat we can do is here. You don't need to have this.\n\n[Speaker 3]\n-1.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, fill right?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUm, find the best seat.\n\nSo,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNow what we can do is?\n\nUh, in this C, it is equals to minus 1. On Max distance equals to -1.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSheets of y\n\n[Speaker 2]\n=?\n\nSo, paying people? Support again.\n\nUh, yeah, it should work, I think.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll right. Let's take a look through it.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUm,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll right, so? Starting at line 21.22, so. Tell me about the things your initial initializing and why you're initializing them.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, the thing here? We store the number of seats.\n\nOkay, sure. Then, we we allocate two arrows arrays to pole, like, for each position on the distance to nearest top, quite seed on the left.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, the what is the left distance and right distance store?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, it allocates two arrows to hold.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nLike for each question. The distance for the distance to nearest occupied shade around itself.\n\nAnd, and right, for the right distance, okay, and it's\n\n[Speaker 1]\nFrom. So, like, what is the left distance is the distance from the last person?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSorry. And\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo the left distance array stores the distance from the last laughs person.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, the distance I can say from the last left person you are asking, or yes for\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThe for the left distance array. What it, what is it? What are the numbers that storing represent?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIt's gonna be. Get the story. Uh, represent is for the left distance array. It remains, like, how far is the close occupied the left, uh, including, like, uh, in my own position if it's occupied?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay. And what's the leftmost value going to be?\n\nSo, the\n\n[Speaker 2]\nLefts are most valuable. It's gonna be like? I can say here if you see. Now, the leftmost value will be like, uh, it's something like zero, I can say. Uh.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhy would the leftmost value be zero? Why would the leftmost value be zero?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, I understand.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, but why? Why is the leftmost value zero? I'm asking so. You said the leftmost value in the left distance array is going to be zero.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWhy is\n\n[Speaker 1]\nIt going to be zero?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThat's because. The index 0. But the city is occupied one, so just. Distance of the closest portion on the left is zero. Like, you are already sitting there.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight. So, if someone's sitting there, then it's zero.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, if someone sitting there, that's zero. Yeah, what if no one's\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSitting there?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo if nobody is sitting there, I can say the value gonna be. Uh, if we can say, there is. No one here occupied. Say to the left of the current position.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight. So then, what would the value be? So, the value\n\n[Speaker 2]\nGonna be like?\n\nIt will be the last large number, so no person found on the left, right?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSure.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo we can say the well, if nobody is there, we can mention it as Infinity.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, you usually n plus one. So, like, we use a larger number instead of mass.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay. Makes sense. All right now. Walk me through what the.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUm. The loop on line 27 does.\n\n7.7.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, uh, it's start scanning from the left length. So, see if the current seat is occupied. I'll update the last operator I and distance to Lost. To and discuss the left occupied CT 0, so. So, if the current state is empty, so the distance to the nearest left occupiest is, uh, is like a minus last one of the pipe. So, and if if none has been seen last, half point is minus infinity. So this becomes a large a very large number so effectively. You can say no left.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay. And so, what are you setting the values to if there's somebody sitting in the seat then?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo the values if somebody? Should be in the seat eyes. I can say.\n\nLike, we are storing like some in left to the right past. Now, we have lost occurate equals so far. Occupations left distance of five. We are having a zero, right? Also, we are having a zero in.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nIf there's a person in the seat, then it'll be a zero distance.\n\nAll right. So then? I think that makes sense, and then you're saying that the right to left is similar in the way it works. Correct?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, yes.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, so then walk me through what the loop on line 54 does.\n\n[Speaker 2]\n154, I can see.\n\nSo here, what happens is? If it gets over all c's to choose the best empty one.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight, how does it do that?\n\nBut how does it? How does it figure that out?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, so it only counts as entities. The thing is. So for?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI the distance to the closest person is the minimum of left and the right distance. And if the seat closed person distance? Is better than any scene so forth. If it is, so far, we can record it, right?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo then real quick? Can you show me what the? Um, the left array. And the right array would look like. For the example here. At the top. So, on line 13 and 14, if you could just fill those two in? For the example I gave you.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSo, you\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWant me to? I should do like?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI mean, you should be able to fill it out. By just the pseudo, you should know how the pseudocode works so you can just fill in these arrays for me so that I understand exactly what's going to be here. Right?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSo left, right\n\n[Speaker 2]\nPass? I can say.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSo\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIt could be zero.\n\nThen we have 51 - 0. Then I equals to 2 minus 4.\n\nRight equals to?\n\nSo, you want me to show how I got these values?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nNo, it makes sense. Um, can you do it again for? This array.\n\n[Speaker 2]\n0, 0, 1, 0.\n\nYeah,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh, you can start filling it in.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nPush, it will be 11.\n\nSo T - 0 and?\n\n0, {comma}, 1.\n\nAnd 8 minus 5 in V3.\n\nYou hear what TV can do is?\n\nAnd we have a -4.\n\nYeah, can you see this? Ben,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah. So what's the right? Answer in this scenario.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nGive me one second. I didn't hear your problem.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhat is that can be the answer?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo I can say. Both are right.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nBoth are right.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nYeah.\n\nSo?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhy is the best seat index zero?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI can say that.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSee.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYour code is, it is because of how the distance, uh. In left distance and right distance come out when you take. So interesting question math dot mean lab distance of I comma right distance of I?\n\nSo I can say, uh, let's check index 0 left distance of 0 equals to. Infinity. Uh, and right distance of 0 equals to 2 and\n\n[Speaker 3]\nThe\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNearest equation of math dot Min, uh, infinity comma to equation 2.\n\nThe max level distance is and both index 0 and index 7 have it. Uh, if you are? Is, then it will pick the first seat or then reaches the Mac resistance with season at zero.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo? I'm not asking why your code does, and I'm asking why you coded it to do that.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI\n\n[Speaker 3]\nCan say that.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThat we. That's what. We get. We get the best seat, right? So, if you want to pick the right most one in a time? So change greater than to greater than or equal to, or if you want.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYes, but okay, I'm just curious. I'm not curious about how I would change the code to make it happen. I'm just curious why that is the case. Like, why did we code it that way?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo?\n\nI can say that.\n\nGive me one second. Let me think about it.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, it's fine. I think we're actually out of time. Um,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI don't know. Give me a second.\n\nUh, I I'll finish the answer, uh, maybe it's happening. And the reason, it's correct. That's why we are actually tied to how we normally write. Is find Max Loops. So why fix index 0? I can say we start with Max distance equals to minus one. Uh, as soon as we find the nearest empty seat with the nearest bigger than Max distance RV update. So once, uh, we set math Christians to a certain value, uh, we never replace it. We see the same value again because the condition is greater than or not greater than or equals to. That means, uh, I can say the first ship that hits the max distance becomes based. Letter seeds have the same Max range, how we ignore them. So, why, if you ask me why it's correct the way as this, uh, the deliberate default choice, uh, in a lot of fine match problems? Speaking of first occurrence of the max respectable and awards extra time breaking walks.\n\nYeah, so\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYou'd basically just followed a standard fine Max that you, you already know how to code up.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYes, okay, that's right.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nCool, all right? Well, we are out of time.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWe are already actually technically over time. Is there any questions you have for me real quick before I go?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, okay. Did you work on, uh, any development that means any product development part?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nDid I ever do product development?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYes,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm, I have done a lot of product development. Yes, I've back in my time in Alexa in primary.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nHow did you gather the feedback from the customers if you? If you work on something that? Uh, that you, you're welcome.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHow do I gather feedback? Well, it depends on who my customers are. You know, key number one is to understand your customers. Um, so when I was in Prime air primarily, I would go talk to the maintenance technicians. I would just walk into their labs and bug them. For when I worked in Alexa. A lot of times, we had entire teams that were dedicated to going and collecting user feedback, uh, be it via surveys or consuming emails that people sent in about things that they didn't like. So, there it really does depend, but it is important that you figure out how to get in contact with your customers, no matter what it is that you're building.\n\nThanks, take it then. Yeah. Cool, all right. Well, good luck with the rest of your interviews. Thank you so much.\n\nOh my God.","numLines":751,"startLine":1,"totalLines":751}}}

The candidate showed practical problem-solving abilities and good understanding of modern development practices. However, there were areas where responses lacked depth and some technical explanations needed clarification.\n\n**Overall Recommendation:** **2 - Inclined No** (Rating Scale: 1=Strong No, 2=Inclined No, 3=Inclined Yes, 4=Strong Yes)\n\n---\n\n## Leadership Principles Assessment\n\n### 1. Learn and Be Curious\n**Rating: 2 - Inclined No**\n\n**Strengths Demonstrated:**\n- Showed willingness to dive deep into complex technical issues (Kafka consumer debugging scenario)\n- Demonstrated learning approach by enabling debug logging to understand root cause of transaction failures\n- Expressed understanding that relying only on generic exceptions makes troubleshooting slow and reactive\n- Created knowledge sharing sessions with team after resolving issues\n\n**Areas of Concern:**\n- When asked clarifying technical questions about the debugging approach, initially confused remote debugging with debug logging, showing potential gaps in technical precision\n- Did not demonstrate proactive learning patterns or examples of seeking out new technologies/methodologies beyond immediate job requirements\n- Limited evidence of curiosity-driven exploration or experimentation with new approaches\n\n**Specific Example from Transcript:**\n> \"Initially, I had no clear starting point, because, uh, the logs were aweak here... I learned more about how our Kafka event extremely work with the transaction microservices since I had previously work in a management.\"\n\n**Missing Elements:**\n- No examples of learning from failures in a systematic way\n- Limited evidence of seeking diverse perspectives or challenging own assumptions\n\n### 2. Earn Trust\n**Rating: 2 - Inclined No** \n\n**Strengths Demonstrated:**\n- Acknowledged when unclear about questions and asked for clarification: \"I didn't get to exactly what you were asking\"\n- Showed transparency in admitting technical confusion initially (debugger vs debug logging)\n- Demonstrated collaborative approach in the peer influence scenario, acknowledging teammate concerns\n- Took responsibility for ensuring team understanding rather than forcing a solution\n\n**Areas of Concern:**\n- Initial confusion about technical implementation details (debugging approach) raised questions about precision in technical communication\n- Limited examples of taking ownership of failures or mistakes\n- Did not provide strong examples of building trust through consistent delivery or reliability\n\n**Specific Example from Transcript:**\n> \"I first acknowledge my peers concerns about complexity and team learning with graphql...

We're gonna go through two different topics, and then about halfway through. I'm gonna go ahead and stop, and we're going to switch over, so I give you time to do the coding question.\n    53→\n    54→[Speaker 3]\n    55→Okay, um?\n    56→\n    57→[Speaker 1]\n    58→If you see if you hear me typing, um? That's just because my keyboard is loud, and I'm very sorry for that, um. But y'all. Also, I have you on the screen over here, and I have the second screen that I'm taking notes on over here. So I am paying attention. I'm just not looking at the camera.\n    59→\n    60→[Speaker 2]\n    61→Okay, cool, all right,\n    62→\n    63→[Speaker 1]\n    64→So? Let's go ahead and dive in. So, can you tell me about a time when you needed a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job well?\n    65→\n    66→[Speaker 2]\n    67→Uh, so, uh, if we think about situation, uh, one example. Want to say is? I didn't get, uh. So, the thing is.\n    68→\n    69→[Speaker 3]\n    70→I didn't get to exactly what you\n    71→\n    72→[Speaker 2]\n    73→Were asking.\n    74→\n    75→[Speaker 1]\n    76→Um. No, don't feel bad, telling me that you don't understand what I'm asking. I'm highly caffeinated, so I'm sure I'm talking too fast.\n    77→\n    78→[Speaker 2]\n    79→Um,\n    80→\n    81→[Speaker 1]\n    82→I again, this is. It's chill, um, so? What I basically want to know is. I,\n    83→\n    84→[Speaker 2]\n    85→I\n    86→\n    87→[Speaker 1]\n    88→Need to understand a time that you were like looking into a problem, right? And you realized that you didn't know what was going on right, and you needed to like, figure out you needed to learn a lot more in order to actually figure out what was happening in this situation. It could have been, you know, like there was a bug that you didn't know what was happening. It could be something like.\n    89→\n    90→He didn't know anything about graphql, so you had to like dive in to figure out how that worked Kafka. For example, if you didn't know how it worked, but you needed to implement it. So, does that make more sense?\n    91→\n    92→[Speaker 2]\n    93→Yeah, that makes sense.\n    94→\n    95→[Speaker 3]\n    96→Okay, so?\n    97→\n    98→[Speaker 1]\n    99→Uh,\n   100→\n   101→[Speaker 2]\n   102→If, uh, so the solution for this, I can say, is. Let me think of an example for this, uh? While working at Wells Fargo on backend microservices.\n   103→\n   104→[Speaker 1]\n   105→Uh,\n   106→\n   107→[Speaker 2]\n   108→I can say Microservice for processing real-time banking transaction. So I noticed that some transactions for, uh, intermittently failing without clear Allen block logs. So this was very critical because?\n   109→\n   110→Ever. A small failure rate could impact customer trust here, so the task was to identify the root cause and ensure the service can reliably without data loss. So, our failed transactions?\n   111→\n   112→[Speaker 1]\n   113→So,\n   114→\n   115→[Speaker 2]\n   116→Initially, I had no clear starting point, because, uh, the logs were awake here. And there were multiple upstreams and Downstream systems involved, right? So? Were begin, like replicating the issue in a lower environment and enabling detailed debug logging to capture more context. So, I learned more about how our Kafka event. Extremely work with the transaction microservices since I had. Previously. Uh, work in a management. So, and the thing is, uh, another one is, uh, I analyzed a message payloads and processing patterns and discovered this certain rate payloads always issue in the capital consumer. So, which wasn't being logged? So, I collaborated with the devops in to deploy enhanced logging to production for a short window. Uh, which confirmed the same issue in live traffic. So, uh, once I identified. A research.\n   117→\n   118→Uh, and sorry, and implemented a fixed to handle the edge case. Gracefully, along with unit tests to prevent regressions. So, then the result was like a fixed registered failure transaction in that service from around two percent to zero percent. So I also updated a logging strategy to capture. Informato, as it details in future instance. So the incident became a knowledge sharing session for the team, so others could troubleshoot similar streaming issues more effectively. Yeah, that's. Think I can say,\n   119→\n   120→[Speaker 1]\n   121→All right, let's dive into that a little bit. So was the errors being thrown, and, and you'll have to excuse me if I didn't catch this? Was the errors being thrown? By Kafka, or was it inside of the compute for the Kafka consumers?\n   122→\n   123→[Speaker 2]\n   124→Uh, I can say it was. Inside with the Kappa consumers.\n   125→\n   126→[Speaker 1]\n   127→Okay, so the Kafka consumers were throwing the air. What kind of tech stack do the Kafka consumers run on top of?\n   128→\n   129→[Speaker 2]\n   130→So this? So I can say. So?\n   131→\n   132→Expect the use. I can say, like, uh, Kafka consumers are back and work like a Java 11. The users spring and? Uh, spring, springboard, and spring.\n   133→\n   134→So, you asked about the text type only, right? Yeah, so, like\n   135→\n   136→[Speaker 1]\n   137→The the consumers, I understand, they're running Java spring boot, uh, their Java spring boot services, are they running? Like, what's the compute that they're running on top of? Is it a cloud consumers? It looks like you guys used AWS, but is it what is it running on top of?\n   138→\n   139→[Speaker 3]\n   140→Uh.\n   141→\n   142→[Speaker 2]\n   143→So? At the top, I can say. I can say in that scenario. No AWS is said to instances running Docker containers like springboot microservices. Like, so, Computing this how it was done actually in some setup services, could also run on AWS cases. Clusters are hosted on AWS. Instead of just running them direct on Ely. Uh, then the setup, like the storage, is also like a processor, transaction, or data persisted in post SQL running. On AWS RDS artifacts locks that? Then also monitoring was done on cloudwatch for AWS level Matrix grafana and Prometheus first level Matrix and Kappa consumer of a log monitoring.\n   144→\n   145→[Speaker 3]\n   146→Okay,\n   147→\n   148→[Speaker 2]\n   149→So either self managed Kafka on easy to Amazon. Amazon msk was used.\n   150→\n   151→[Speaker 1]\n   152→Okay, so the Kafka itself was running on a managed ec2 instance, but the compute for the consumers were running on eks and Docker containers. Okay, so the eks Docker containers were where the logs were not getting read from because they wasn't proper error messaging. Right? So, what is the? What is the thing that you did in order to improve the error logging? Was it just? Was there an exception being thrown and nothing was being logged for it. Did you actually have to change the? Um, the logging strategy, where the log's not being published to cloudwatch at all, like, what was the actual solution to the problem?\n   153→\n   154→[Speaker 2]\n   155→So, so exactly, uh?\n   156→\n   157→[Speaker 1]\n   158→What\n   159→\n   160→[Speaker 2]\n   161→I did to improve the error logging was? Was like to enable debugger, and it is logging here in spring cap. The configuration are temporarily for everything consumer group, so I would capture stack traces and method level of for failing messages. So, grab the message processing logic in a trade catch block, especially around the deceleration and transformation. All steps long,\n   162→\n   163→[Speaker 3]\n   164→The\n   165→\n   166→[Speaker 2]\n   167→Full exception stack and Trace here. And the message header.\n   168→\n   169→[Speaker 1]\n   170→So, so let me see if I understand correctly you. There was an exception that you could see in logs, but you couldn't root cause it. And so, what you did is you turned on the debugger. In production so that you could go ahead and get the full stack trace of what was going on. Right?\n   171→\n   172→Is that, am I understanding that? Okay, so? How did that work because usually when you attach a debugger to Java processes? It actually halts the process, right? So, like, was this, actually, the debugger being attached, or were you just having it dump extra logs?\n   173→\n   174→[Speaker 2]\n   175→So actually. Uh, I didn't get this actually one.\n   176→\n   177→[Speaker 1]\n   178→So, the way Java did, yeah, Java debuggers generally stop. The process when it finds an exception, right? If you said debug points.\n   179→\n   180→[Speaker 3]\n   181→Right? So\n   182→\n   183→[Speaker 1]\n   184→You, you said, debug points in a production environment?\n   185→\n   186→[Speaker 2]\n   187→Yes, and then.\n   188→\n   189→[Speaker 1]\n   190→But didn't that impact? The customer whose call you stopped? With the debugger.\n   191→\n   192→[Speaker 2]\n   193→So?\n   194→\n   195→[Speaker 3]\n   196→Okay\n   197→\n   198→[Speaker 2]\n   199→Now! I can say I'm actually a point, and so actually, when I said enabling, uh, deblogging, right, I meant like, uh, switching springboard? So, like on locker Kappa consumer classes, this is not interactive brother. It's just making application output, uh, much more. What logs so we can see the method, cause parameters, and stack traces without stopping the process. So, attaching a remote debug? Head to production. Can pass threats are caused by modes and impacts. SNS for customers like, not acceptable for banking transactions, so it also possess security issues, right? So, if the remote debugger Port is export? So, what I actually did in this case is, uh, updated kubernetes deployment, uh, to set a temporary logging configuration?\n   200→\n   201→And added a Target targeted logging. Inside the message processing or try catch so I could dump the exception by full stack price and nonsense to message metadata and deploy that content to production, or for a limited time, captured the logs in LK and rolled back into. Forward.\n   202→\n   203→[Speaker 1]\n   204→So, so let me see if I understand he didn't actually attach a debugger. You turned on debug level, logging in your logger, and then you added additional debug logs to a try catch block. Understood. All right. So then? That way. There it was, not an interactive debugger. It was just a debug level logging. Understood yes? All right, that makes sense. And so. What did you learn from the the debug level logging you basically? You said you dumped the entire stack Trace out?\n   205→\n   206→[Speaker 3]\n   207→Um,\n   208→\n   209→[Speaker 1]\n   210→Did you end up adding logs to the the service so that you could figure these things out in the future, but without having to go in and do debugging logging or is the is the standard operating procedure to go in and activate debug logging when you see issues?\n   211→\n   212→[Speaker 2]\n   213→Uh, so. So I learned actually was like once I had the root cause, uh, no, I did. I did not want the team to have safely to debug everything, right? So some sometimes something they went wrong? So, what I did actually learn and change it from it? Is that relaying only on generic exceptions? Makes troubleshooting slow and reactive, right? So, debugging level logging in production should be the last, uh, shot here. So, not a standard practice because? It's noisy and can impact log injection, or like some storage cost. And then, I added, structured in full level locks in Kafka consumer error handling code. So now! Always capture exception type and messages, uh, the relevant message key odd headers. So, consumer group and partition like this. So, this way, we we get enough context from most future instance without needing to enable the debug right. So, like, uh? In guidelines for all our Kafka consumers and share it with the team. So now, every new consumer service must include. This contextual error logs by default, a debug logging in production is still possible, but only. Use temporary and deeper tracing is absolutely necessary. So, basically, from this, I held for a long term like improved or default logging. So, the next single book could be diagnated from normal info logs without extra steps.\n   214→\n   215→Okay.\n   216→\n   217→[Speaker 1]\n   218→I think it makes sense. All right, let's move on to the next question. Um. So, can you describe a time? When you needed to influence a peer who had a differing opinion about a shared goal.\n   219→\n   220→[Speaker 2]\n   221→So, if you want me to tell time that I influenced it up here.\n   222→\n   223→So, let me think of an example. So, uh, one example I can see is, uh, I can say at Wells Fargo only. Be here working on new feature for the customer dashboard that require integrating both rfql and rest kps. So, my PA billiard we would stick? The rest for Simplicity. While I felt that a hybrid approach like using graphql for complex Mr data. And rest. For a simpler input, it would be better. So the task what we needed to agree on API strategy here before starting implementation. Since both back and service contracts and front-end queries would depend on it. All that actions I took was, like, I first acknowledge my peers concerns about complexity and team learning with graphql, so I gathered metrics and real examples for our current rest endpoints are showing that fetching nested data often required three to four round trips. Words, so I have created a small proof of concept. Showing that some dashboards data fetching in my stream. So, we reviewed this side by side in a technical design meeting along with the trace trade-off in caching, error handling, and schema maintenance. So I propose the com, a compromise here, like, adopt a graphql for data, heavy composite queries. Uh, keep rest for single or resource endpoints. So, the result was the team agreed to hybrid model. This registered damage dashboard loads. Seconds, and by 30 percent while keeping implementation complexity are manageable. My peers? Later acknowledge that.\n   224→\n   225→And. I can say that seeing real performance gauge and clear maintenance plan help change their prospect too. So, in this case, this approach becomes the reference pattern for other types building complex customer facing UV components. Meant this, so I have learned that influencing peer isn't about winning an argument, right? It's just about finding common ground through data prototypes and help with their concerns.\n   226→\n   227→[Speaker 1]\n   228→Makes sense. So, how did you alleviate? Wait, what were their main concerns? About graphql.\n   229→\n   230→So, yeah, what were they?\n   231→\n   232→[Speaker 2]\n   233→Okay, so gracias consons or layer, so a constant and consensual so? There was. And we. Then there was a learning team for the team, right? So not everything was familiar with graphql queries, like a resolve and implementation. So they worried it. Uh, it would slow the team down at the start.\n   234→\n   235→[Speaker 1]\n   236→Okay, like there\n   237→\n   238→[Speaker 2]\n   239→Was an increased complexity. Actually, uh, setting up graphics or adds another layer on the.\n   240→\n   241→Existing resting processor, so we have. And there was a secure like there was some security Councils to here. So, specific endpoints are more flexible, but that means. They can potentially request more data than internet.\n   242→\n   243→[Speaker 1]\n   244→I'm definitely I'm very familiar with graphql, um. So, what was your did they not have any concerns over the long-term maintenance of maintaining both rest endpoints and graphql endpoints?\n   245→\n   246→[Speaker 2]\n   247→I can say, uh, when coming. Um. So? This part. And. The thing is, uh, one of the biggest concern. Uh, in one of my page. Maintenance and cost of supporting both rest and graph rank points. Their point was that over time, we could end up with duplicate logic in two different API layers, which could increase technical depth like required more regression testing and. Duplicate onboarding for new developers,\n   248→\n   249→[Speaker 1]\n   250→So\n   251→\n   252→[Speaker 2]\n   253→They were also concerned about documentation here. If they understand the Rascal contracts, uh, we aren't keeping. So,\n   254→\n   255→[Speaker 1]\n   256→Then why, why use if the main concern is having two different Tech Stacks? Why was there an alternate option to just create, um, rest a rest endpoint specifically to solve the query patterns of the heavy doubt data? Quests, like, why did you need graphql instead of a bespoke rest API?\n   257→\n   258→[Speaker 2]\n   259→So I can say that.\n   260→\n   261→The reason why? Editor was actually. There was actually. If the only multiple cost to get the needed data like, we could keep the stack purely restocurrency. Team might still choose graphql instead of only few recipes that are its flexibility, like lines can Define exactly what fields they need without back and\n   262→\n   263→[Speaker 1]\n   264→Having to\n   265→\n   266→[Speaker 2]\n   267→Create a new endpoint for every variant. And so. Like, instead of creating say like a customer details. And all these basically call these things can handle all those through a single schema graph. Yeah,\n   268→\n   269→[Speaker 3]\n   270→So is,\n   271→\n   272→[Speaker 2]\n   273→Yeah.\n   274→\n   275→[Speaker 1]\n   276→So, the I understand the reason why you would want a graphql endpoint because you can just fetch whatever data you want. Not all of the data. But the point you made at the beginning was that you implemented it because it would allow you to reduce multiple round-trip calls, right? So, why did you not just create an API that would solve specifically? Um, that round trip call issue. Instead of implementing a new API layer, like, what was the, what was the key factor that said, no, we're not going to create an API specifically to solve this. We're going to create an entire layer, right? So, what was, what was that key factor?\n   277→\n   278→[Speaker 2]\n   279→So? We couldn't have a build a single. And I can say the thing is what I thought for this. Is? We weren't just have one fixture problem here. So our dashboards? Need change frequently? Because our product manager kept adding new combination of fields, filters, and related resources? If we, when we just restrain point for everybody, listen. We have ended up creating and maintaining multiple composite and endpoints over time, like repeating development, testing documentation, work every time. So with graphql, uh, we could just.\n   280→\n   281→And I can say that we were creating a new backend point every time there are a requirement. And Logics, uh, I can say the UA requirement shifted and give the backend knowledge centralized. While still reducing over fetching and under fetching, so deciding factor wasn't performance alone. It was long term adopority, I can say.\n   282→\n   283→[Speaker 1]\n   284→Right. Okay, well, that's just. I guess that didn't come out when you were talking about it earlier. Um. Okay. Cool! Um. So, let's go ahead and move over to the, uh. Coding part of this. Do you have the Live code link?\n   285→\n   286→[Speaker 2]\n   287→Yes, yes, I do have. Okay.\n   288→\n   289→[Speaker 1]\n   290→Um.\n   291→\n   292→[Speaker 3]\n   293→Sorry,\n   294→\n   295→[Speaker 2]\n   296→Ben,\n   297→\n   298→[Speaker 1]\n   299→No worries.\n   300→\n   301→[Speaker 3]\n   302→Are you\n   303→\n   304→[Speaker 1]\n   305→Going to be using, uh, JavaScript, today?\n   306→\n   307→[Speaker 2]\n   308→Uh, Java,\n   309→\n   310→[Speaker 1]\n   311→Java, okay?\n   312→\n   313→All right.\n   314→\n   315→[Speaker 2]\n   316→Give me one second.\n   317→\n   318→[Speaker 3]\n   319→Digital,\n   320→\n   321→[Speaker 2]\n   322→Okay?\n   323→\n   324→[Speaker 1]\n   325→Yep, looks like you're in, oh. Kicked me out, God dang it! All right.\n   326→\n   327→So, I pasted the prompt up here. Um. Go ahead and give it a read. Um.\n   328→\n   329→[Speaker 3]\n   330→Represents\n   331→\n   332→[Speaker 2]\n   333→A question.\n   334→\n   335→[Speaker 3]\n   336→So, we have\n   337→\n   338→[Speaker 2]\n   339→An array of seeds. Also, cities outwarded up, right? So, one represents.\n   340→\n   341→So sleep is occupied and zero reference. It is empty.\n   342→\n   343→So, what we can do is? For each seat, we can store the distance for the from the nearest ones to left side. If there are no? Right on the left? So you can keep it as Infinity or large number.\n   344→\n   345→So, then one right, low lock now, so what we can do is? Uh, from each seat, we can store distance from nearest one. Right side. So again, if there is no one on the right? Uh, keep it as Infinity.\n   346→\n   347→So command distance I can say for each mtcp 0. So, find the minimum of left distance and right distance, so that's the distance to the call closest person. Also the coolest person. We can drag the sheep that maximize the minimum distance.\n   348→\n   349→[Speaker 1]\n   350→Okay. Go ahead and coat it up.\n   351→\n   352→[Speaker 3]\n   353→What\n   354→\n   355→[Speaker 2]\n   356→We can do is we can have a class now.\n   357→\n   358→[Speaker 3]\n   359→I'm saying, like\n   360→\n   361→[Speaker 2]\n   362→The oblique.\n   363→\n   364→[Speaker 3]\n   365→Maximize\n   366→\n   367→[Speaker 2]\n   368→Distance.\n   369→\n   370→Glue just like this, you can say. Them. Inside this, we can have a method.\n   371→\n   372→You can find.\n   373→\n   374→[Speaker 3]\n   375→So, image.\n   376→\n   377→[Speaker 2]\n   378→Just equals.\n   379→\n   380→[Speaker 3]\n   381→You\n   382→\n   383→[Speaker 2]\n   384→Can sound like this.\n   385→\n   386→[Speaker 3]\n   387→And what\n   388→\n   389→[Speaker 2]\n   390→Will be like that?\n   391→\n   392→And last for. 2 divided equals minus.\n   393→\n   394→It's done.\n   395→\n   396→It's, it's not.\n   397→\n   398→[Speaker 3]\n   399→+ 2.\n   400→\n   401→[Speaker 2]\n   402→What we can do is here. You don't need to have this.\n   403→\n   404→[Speaker 3]\n   405→-1.\n   406→\n   407→[Speaker 2]\n   408→So, fill right?\n   409→\n   410→[Speaker 3]\n   411→Um, find the best seat.\n   412→\n   413→So,\n   414→\n   415→[Speaker 2]\n   416→Now what we can do is?\n   417→\n   418→Uh, in this C, it is equals to minus 1. On Max distance equals to -1.\n   419→\n   420→[Speaker 3]\n   421→Sheets of y\n   422→\n   423→[Speaker 2]\n   424→=?\n   425→\n   426→So, paying people? Support again.\n   427→\n   428→Uh, yeah, it should work, I think.\n   429→\n   430→[Speaker 1]\n   431→All right. Let's take a look through it.\n   432→\n   433→[Speaker 3]\n   434→Um,\n   435→\n   436→[Speaker 1]\n   437→All right, so? Starting at line 21.22, so. Tell me about the things your initial initializing and why you're initializing them.\n   438→\n   439→[Speaker 2]\n   440→So, the thing here? We store the number of seats.\n   441→\n   442→Okay, sure. Then, we we allocate two arrows arrays to pole, like, for each position on the distance to nearest top, quite seed on the left.\n   443→\n   444→[Speaker 1]\n   445→So, the what is the left distance and right distance store?\n   446→\n   447→[Speaker 2]\n   448→Uh, it allocates two arrows to hold.\n   449→\n   450→[Speaker 1]\n   451→Yeah.\n   452→\n   453→[Speaker 2]\n   454→Like for each question. The distance for the distance to nearest occupied shade around itself.\n   455→\n   456→And, and right, for the right distance, okay, and it's\n   457→\n   458→[Speaker 1]\n   459→From. So, like, what is the left distance is the distance from the last person?\n   460→\n   461→[Speaker 2]\n   462→Sorry. And\n   463→\n   464→[Speaker 1]\n   465→So the left distance array stores the distance from the last laughs person.\n   466→\n   467→[Speaker 2]\n   468→Uh, the distance I can say from the last left person you are asking, or yes for\n   469→\n   470→[Speaker 1]\n   471→The for the left distance array. What it, what is it? What are the numbers that storing represent?\n   472→\n   473→[Speaker 2]\n   474→It's gonna be. Get the story. Uh, represent is for the left distance array. It remains, like, how far is the close occupied the left, uh, including, like, uh, in my own position if it's occupied?\n   475→\n   476→[Speaker 1]\n   477→Okay. And what's the leftmost value going to be?\n   478→\n   479→So, the\n   480→\n   481→[Speaker 2]\n   482→Lefts are most valuable. It's gonna be like? I can say here if you see. Now, the leftmost value will be like, uh, it's something like zero, I can say. Uh.\n   483→\n   484→[Speaker 1]\n   485→Why would the leftmost value be zero? Why would the leftmost value be zero?\n   486→\n   487→[Speaker 2]\n   488→Yeah, I understand.\n   489→\n   490→[Speaker 1]\n   491→Yeah, but why? Why is the leftmost value zero? I'm asking so. You said the leftmost value in the left distance array is going to be zero.\n   492→\n   493→[Speaker 2]\n   494→Why is\n   495→\n   496→[Speaker 1]\n   497→It going to be zero?\n   498→\n   499→[Speaker 2]\n   500→That's because. The index 0. But the city is occupied one, so just. Distance of the closest portion on the left is zero. Like, you are already sitting there.\n   501→\n   502→[Speaker 1]\n   503→Right. So, if someone's sitting there, then it's zero.\n   504→\n   505→[Speaker 2]\n   506→So, if someone sitting there, that's zero. Yeah, what if no one's\n   507→\n   508→[Speaker 1]\n   509→Sitting there?\n   510→\n   511→[Speaker 2]\n   512→So if nobody is sitting there, I can say the value gonna be. Uh, if we can say, there is. No one here occupied. Say to the left of the current position.\n   513→\n   514→[Speaker 1]\n   515→Right. So then, what would the value be? So, the value\n   516→\n   517→[Speaker 2]\n   518→Gonna be like?\n   519→\n   520→It will be the last large number, so no person found on the left, right?\n   521→\n   522→[Speaker 1]\n   523→Sure.\n   524→\n   525→[Speaker 2]\n   526→So we can say the well, if nobody is there, we can mention it as Infinity.\n   527→\n   528→[Speaker 1]\n   529→Okay.\n   530→\n   531→[Speaker 2]\n   532→So, you usually n plus one. So, like, we use a larger number instead of mass.\n   533→\n   534→[Speaker 1]\n   535→Okay. Makes sense. All right now. Walk me through what the.\n   536→\n   537→[Speaker 3]\n   538→Um. The loop on line 27 does.\n   539→\n   540→7.7.\n   541→\n   542→[Speaker 2]\n   543→So, uh, it's start scanning from the left length. So, see if the current seat is occupied. I'll update the last operator I and distance to Lost. To and discuss the left occupied CT 0, so. So, if the current state is empty, so the distance to the nearest left occupiest is, uh, is like a minus last one of the pipe. So, and if if none has been seen last, half point is minus infinity. So this becomes a large a very large number so effectively. You can say no left.\n   544→\n   545→[Speaker 1]\n   546→Okay. And so, what are you setting the values to if there's somebody sitting in the seat then?\n   547→\n   548→[Speaker 2]\n   549→So the values if somebody? Should be in the seat eyes. I can say.\n   550→\n   551→Like, we are storing like some in left to the right past. Now, we have lost occurate equals so far. Occupations left distance of five. We are having a zero, right? Also, we are having a zero in.\n   552→\n   553→[Speaker 1]\n   554→If there's a person in the seat, then it'll be a zero distance.\n   555→\n   556→All right. So then? I think that makes sense, and then you're saying that the right to left is similar in the way it works. Correct?\n   557→\n   558→[Speaker 2]\n   559→Uh, yes.\n   560→\n   561→[Speaker 1]\n   562→Okay, so then walk me through what the loop on line 54 does.\n   563→\n   564→[Speaker 2]\n   565→154, I can see.\n   566→\n   567→So here, what happens is? If it gets over all c's to choose the best empty one.\n   568→\n   569→[Speaker 1]\n   570→Right, how does it do that?\n   571→\n   572→But how does it? How does it figure that out?\n   573→\n   574→[Speaker 2]\n   575→Uh, so it only counts as entities. The thing is. So for?\n   576→\n   577→[Speaker 3]\n   578→Uh,\n   579→\n   580→[Speaker 2]\n   581→I the distance to the closest person is the minimum of left and the right distance. And if the seat closed person distance? Is better than any scene so forth. If it is, so far, we can record it, right?\n   582→\n   583→[Speaker 1]\n   584→So then real quick? Can you show me what the? Um, the left array. And the right array would look like. For the example here. At the top. So, on line 13 and 14, if you could just fill those two in? For the example I gave you.\n   585→\n   586→[Speaker 3]\n   587→So, you\n   588→\n   589→[Speaker 2]\n   590→Want me to? I should do like?\n   591→\n   592→[Speaker 1]\n   593→I mean, you should be able to fill it out. By just the pseudo, you should know how the pseudocode works so you can just fill in these arrays for me so that I understand exactly what's going to be here. Right?\n   594→\n   595→[Speaker 3]\n   596→So left, right\n   597→\n   598→[Speaker 2]\n   599→Pass? I can say.\n   600→\n   601→[Speaker 3]\n   602→So\n   603→\n   604→[Speaker 2]\n   605→It could be zero.\n   606→\n   607→Then we have 51 - 0. Then I equals to 2 minus 4.\n   608→\n   609→Right equals to?\n   610→\n   611→So, you want me to show how I got these values?\n   612→\n   613→[Speaker 1]\n   614→No, it makes sense. Um, can you do it again for? This array.\n   615→\n   616→[Speaker 2]\n   617→0, 0, 1, 0.\n   618→\n   619→Yeah,\n   620→\n   621→[Speaker 1]\n   622→Uh, you can start filling it in.\n   623→\n   624→[Speaker 2]\n   625→Push, it will be 11.\n   626→\n   627→So T - 0 and?\n   628→\n   629→0, {comma}, 1.\n   630→\n   631→And 8 minus 5 in V3.\n   632→\n   633→You hear what TV can do is?\n   634→\n   635→And we have a -4.\n   636→\n   637→Yeah, can you see this? Ben,\n   638→\n   639→[Speaker 1]\n   640→Yeah. So what's the right? Answer in this scenario.\n   641→\n   642→[Speaker 3]\n   643→Uh,\n   644→\n   645→[Speaker 2]\n   646→Give me one second. I didn't hear your problem.\n   647→\n   648→[Speaker 1]\n   649→What is that can be the answer?\n   650→\n   651→[Speaker 2]\n   652→So I can say. Both are right.\n   653→\n   654→[Speaker 1]\n   655→Both are right.\n   656→\n   657→[Speaker 3]\n   658→Yeah.\n   659→\n   660→So?\n   661→\n   662→[Speaker 1]\n   663→Why is the best seat index zero?\n   664→\n   665→[Speaker 2]\n   666→I can say that.\n   667→\n   668→[Speaker 3]\n   669→See.\n   670→\n   671→[Speaker 2]\n   672→Your code is, it is because of how the distance, uh. In left distance and right distance come out when you take. So interesting question math dot mean lab distance of I comma right distance of I?\n   673→\n   674→So I can say, uh, let's check index 0 left distance of 0 equals to. Infinity. Uh, and right distance of 0 equals to 2 and\n   675→\n   676→[Speaker 3]\n   677→The\n   678→\n   679→[Speaker 2]\n   680→Nearest equation of math dot Min, uh, infinity comma to equation 2.\n   681→\n   682→The max level distance is and both index 0 and index 7 have it. Uh, if you are? Is, then it will pick the first seat or then reaches the Mac resistance with season at zero.\n   683→\n   684→[Speaker 1]\n   685→So? I'm not asking why your code does, and I'm asking why you coded it to do that.\n   686→\n   687→[Speaker 2]\n   688→I\n   689→\n   690→[Speaker 3]\n   691→Can say that.\n   692→\n   693→[Speaker 2]\n   694→That we. That's what. We get. We get the best seat, right? So, if you want to pick the right most one in a time? So change greater than to greater than or equal to, or if you want.\n   695→\n   696→[Speaker 1]\n   697→Yes, but okay, I'm just curious. I'm not curious about how I would change the code to make it happen. I'm just curious why that is the case. Like, why did we code it that way?\n   698→\n   699→[Speaker 2]\n   700→So?\n   701→\n   702→I can say that.\n   703→\n   704→Give me one second. Let me think about it.\n   705→\n   706→[Speaker 1]\n   707→Yeah, it's fine. I think we're actually out of time. Um,\n   708→\n   709→[Speaker 2]\n   710→I don't know. Give me a second.\n   711→\n   712→Uh, I I'll finish the answer, uh, maybe it's happening. And the reason, it's correct. That's why we are actually tied to how we normally write. Is find Max Loops. So why fix index 0? I can say we start with Max distance equals to minus one. Uh, as soon as we find the nearest empty seat with the nearest bigger than Max distance RV update. So once, uh, we set math Christians to a certain value, uh, we never replace it. We see the same value again because the condition is greater than or not greater than or equals to. That means, uh, I can say the first ship that hits the max distance becomes based. Letter seeds have the same Max range, how we ignore them. So, why, if you ask me why it's correct the way as this, uh, the deliberate default choice, uh, in a lot of fine match problems? Speaking of first occurrence of the max respectable and awards extra time breaking walks.\n   713→\n   714→Yeah, so\n   715→\n   716→[Speaker 1]\n   717→You'd basically just followed a standard fine Max that you, you already know how to code up.\n   718→\n   719→[Speaker 2]\n   720→Yes, okay, that's right.\n   721→\n   722→[Speaker 1]\n   723→Cool, all right? Well, we are out of time.\n   724→\n   725→[Speaker 2]\n   726→Um,\n   727→\n   728→[Speaker 1]\n   729→We are already actually technically over time. Is there any questions you have for me real quick before I go?\n   730→\n   731→[Speaker 2]\n   732→Uh, okay. Did you work on, uh, any development that means any product development part?\n   733→\n   734→[Speaker 1]\n   735→Did I ever do product development?\n   736→\n   737→[Speaker 2]\n   738→Yes,\n   739→\n   740→[Speaker 1]\n   741→Um, I have done a lot of product development. Yes, I've back in my time in Alexa in primary.\n   742→\n   743→[Speaker 2]\n   744→How did you gather the feedback from the customers if you? If you work on something that? Uh, that you, you're welcome.\n   745→\n   746→[Speaker 1]\n   747→How do I gather feedback? Well, it depends on who my customers are. You know, key number one is to understand your customers. Um, so when I was in Prime air primarily, I would go talk to the maintenance technicians. I would just walk into their labs and bug them. For when I worked in Alexa. A lot of times, we had entire teams that were dedicated to going and collecting user feedback, uh, be it via surveys or consuming emails that people sent in about things that they didn't like. So, there it really does depend, but it is important that you figure out how to get in contact with your customers, no matter what it is that you're building.\n   748→\n   749→Thanks, take it then. Yeah. Cool, all right. Well, good luck with the rest of your interviews. Thank you so much.\n   750→\n   751→Oh my God.\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious.

So, how's your day been so far?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIt went very well, but the worst thing happened is, uh, before I have. I shared my mic, so that's why I didn't take the call. So, yeah, it's been a bit of worry for me, but I hope maybe he will take the call. Oh,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYou, you were. You weren't able to make it to your first interview.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, yes,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, don't worry about it. I'll, um. I'll ping the recruiter and make sure that they. They\n\n[Speaker 2]\nKnow what's\n\n[Speaker 1]\nGoing on?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay, let\n\n[Speaker 1]\nMe let me do that for you. Real quick, um? So, just give me one second here.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, okay. Hi, I'm a software engineer with around creation of experience designing and developing a scalable responsive applications. So, I specialize in react and rest graph apis and have good hands-on experience, are in Docker, kubernetes, and AWS, and building cicd pipelines to take care of from medium access and genius, so I can say, uh, I have strong background in oops, microservices, and real time. Even driven systems are using camera along with SQL, SQL, and no SQL databases, Etc.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nOkay.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nCool. Thank you. Um, all right. So let me introduce myself, um? My name is Ben. Uh, I am a senior software developer at Amazon on the asbx golden path team. I've been in Amazon for about eight years. Um. While I've been in Amazon, I've been in a few different places, uh, I've gone from working on Alexa. To working on prime air. So, like the the Drone delivery program? To working on operator tooling to make you know operations that Amazon easier. And now I am. At the golden path team, where we kind of build out recommendations for how folks should be building microservices, async jobs, genai applications, Etc throughout the company. And then pushing on teams in order to build things that will allow them to actually have the recommended tool set to complete their jobs.\n\nVery broad. So? With that in mind. Yeah, so. Um, the way this is going to be working. I'm going to just be asking you a bunch of questions. Um, I'm going to save. We're going to basically go. We're gonna go through two different topics, and then about halfway through. I'm gonna go ahead and stop, and we're going to switch over, so I give you time to do the coding question.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nOkay, um?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nIf you see if you hear me typing, um? That's just because my keyboard is loud, and I'm very sorry for that, um. But y'all. Also, I have you on the screen over here, and I have the second screen that I'm taking notes on over here. So I am paying attention. I'm just not looking at the camera.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay, cool, all right,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo? Let's go ahead and dive in. So, can you tell me about a time when you needed a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job well?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, so, uh, if we think about situation, uh, one example. Want to say is? I didn't get, uh. So, the thing is.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nI didn't get to exactly what you\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWere asking.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm. No, don't feel bad, telling me that you don't understand what I'm asking. I'm highly caffeinated, so I'm sure I'm talking too fast.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI again, this is. It's chill, um, so? What I basically want to know is. I,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI\n\n[Speaker 1]\nNeed to understand a time that you were like looking into a problem, right? And you realized that you didn't know what was going on right, and you needed to like, figure out you needed to learn a lot more in order to actually figure out what was happening in this situation. It could have been, you know, like there was a bug that you didn't know what was happening. It could be something like.\n\nHe didn't know anything about graphql, so you had to like dive in to figure out how that worked Kafka. For example, if you didn't know how it worked, but you needed to implement it. So, does that make more sense?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nOkay, so?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIf, uh, so the solution for this, I can say, is. Let me think of an example for this, uh? While working at Wells Fargo on backend microservices.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI can say Microservice for processing real-time banking transaction. So I noticed that some transactions for, uh, intermittently failing without clear Allen block logs. So this was very critical because?\n\nEver. A small failure rate could impact customer trust here, so the task was to identify the root cause and ensure the service can reliably without data loss. So, our failed transactions?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nInitially, I had no clear starting point, because, uh, the logs were awake here. And there were multiple upstreams and Downstream systems involved, right? So? Were begin, like replicating the issue in a lower environment and enabling detailed debug logging to capture more context. So, I learned more about how our Kafka event. Extremely work with the transaction microservices since I had. Previously. Uh, work in a management. So, and the thing is, uh, another one is, uh, I analyzed a message payloads and processing patterns and discovered this certain rate payloads always issue in the capital consumer. So, which wasn't being logged? So, I collaborated with the devops in to deploy enhanced logging to production for a short window. Uh, which confirmed the same issue in live traffic. So, uh, once I identified. A research.\n\nUh, and sorry, and implemented a fixed to handle the edge case. Gracefully, along with unit tests to prevent regressions. So, then the result was like a fixed registered failure transaction in that service from around two percent to zero percent. So I also updated a logging strategy to capture. Informato, as it details in future instance. So the incident became a knowledge sharing session for the team, so others could troubleshoot similar streaming issues more effectively. Yeah, that's. Think I can say,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll right, let's dive into that a little bit. So was the errors being thrown, and, and you'll have to excuse me if I didn't catch this? Was the errors being thrown? By Kafka, or was it inside of the compute for the Kafka consumers?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, I can say it was. Inside with the Kappa consumers.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, so the Kafka consumers were throwing the air. What kind of tech stack do the Kafka consumers run on top of?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo this? So I can say. So?\n\nExpect the use. I can say, like, uh, Kafka consumers are back and work like a Java 11. The users spring and? Uh, spring, springboard, and spring.\n\nSo, you asked about the text type only, right? Yeah, so, like\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThe the consumers, I understand, they're running Java spring boot, uh, their Java spring boot services, are they running? Like, what's the compute that they're running on top of? Is it a cloud consumers? It looks like you guys used AWS, but is it what is it running on top of?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUh.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo? At the top, I can say. I can say in that scenario. No AWS is said to instances running Docker containers like springboot microservices. Like, so, Computing this how it was done actually in some setup services, could also run on AWS cases. Clusters are hosted on AWS. Instead of just running them direct on Ely. Uh, then the setup, like the storage, is also like a processor, transaction, or data persisted in post SQL running. On AWS RDS artifacts locks that? Then also monitoring was done on cloudwatch for AWS level Matrix grafana and Prometheus first level Matrix and Kappa consumer of a log monitoring.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nOkay,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo either self managed Kafka on easy to Amazon. Amazon msk was used.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, so the Kafka itself was running on a managed ec2 instance, but the compute for the consumers were running on eks and Docker containers. Okay, so the eks Docker containers were where the logs were not getting read from because they wasn't proper error messaging. Right? So, what is the? What is the thing that you did in order to improve the error logging? Was it just? Was there an exception being thrown and nothing was being logged for it. Did you actually have to change the? Um, the logging strategy, where the log's not being published to cloudwatch at all, like, what was the actual solution to the problem?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, so exactly, uh?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhat\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI did to improve the error logging was? Was like to enable debugger, and it is logging here in spring cap. The configuration are temporarily for everything consumer group, so I would capture stack traces and method level of for failing messages. So, grab the message processing logic in a trade catch block, especially around the deceleration and transformation. All steps long,\n\n[Speaker 3]\nThe\n\n[Speaker 2]\nFull exception stack and Trace here. And the message header.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, so let me see if I understand correctly you. There was an exception that you could see in logs, but you couldn't root cause it. And so, what you did is you turned on the debugger. In production so that you could go ahead and get the full stack trace of what was going on. Right?\n\nIs that, am I understanding that? Okay, so? How did that work because usually when you attach a debugger to Java processes? It actually halts the process, right? So, like, was this, actually, the debugger being attached, or were you just having it dump extra logs?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo actually. Uh, I didn't get this actually one.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, the way Java did, yeah, Java debuggers generally stop. The process when it finds an exception, right? If you said debug points.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nRight? So\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYou, you said, debug points in a production environment?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYes, and then.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nBut didn't that impact? The customer whose call you stopped? With the debugger.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nOkay\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNow! I can say I'm actually a point, and so actually, when I said enabling, uh, deblogging, right, I meant like, uh, switching springboard? So, like on locker Kappa consumer classes, this is not interactive brother. It's just making application output, uh, much more. What logs so we can see the method, cause parameters, and stack traces without stopping the process. So, attaching a remote debug? Head to production. Can pass threats are caused by modes and impacts. SNS for customers like, not acceptable for banking transactions, so it also possess security issues, right? So, if the remote debugger Port is export? So, what I actually did in this case is, uh, updated kubernetes deployment, uh, to set a temporary logging configuration?\n\nAnd added a Target targeted logging. Inside the message processing or try catch so I could dump the exception by full stack price and nonsense to message metadata and deploy that content to production, or for a limited time, captured the logs in LK and rolled back into. Forward.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, so let me see if I understand he didn't actually attach a debugger. You turned on debug level, logging in your logger, and then you added additional debug logs to a try catch block. Understood. All right. So then? That way. There it was, not an interactive debugger. It was just a debug level logging. Understood yes? All right, that makes sense. And so. What did you learn from the the debug level logging you basically? You said you dumped the entire stack Trace out?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUm,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nDid you end up adding logs to the the service so that you could figure these things out in the future, but without having to go in and do debugging logging or is the is the standard operating procedure to go in and activate debug logging when you see issues?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, so. So I learned actually was like once I had the root cause, uh, no, I did. I did not want the team to have safely to debug everything, right? So some sometimes something they went wrong? So, what I did actually learn and change it from it? Is that relaying only on generic exceptions? Makes troubleshooting slow and reactive, right? So, debugging level logging in production should be the last, uh, shot here. So, not a standard practice because? It's noisy and can impact log injection, or like some storage cost. And then, I added, structured in full level locks in Kafka consumer error handling code. So now! Always capture exception type and messages, uh, the relevant message key odd headers. So, consumer group and partition like this. So, this way, we we get enough context from most future instance without needing to enable the debug right. So, like, uh? In guidelines for all our Kafka consumers and share it with the team. So now, every new consumer service must include. This contextual error logs by default, a debug logging in production is still possible, but only. Use temporary and deeper tracing is absolutely necessary. So, basically, from this, I held for a long term like improved or default logging. So, the next single book could be diagnated from normal info logs without extra steps.\n\nOkay.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI think it makes sense. All right, let's move on to the next question. Um. So, can you describe a time? When you needed to influence a peer who had a differing opinion about a shared goal.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, if you want me to tell time that I influenced it up here.\n\nSo, let me think of an example. So, uh, one example I can see is, uh, I can say at Wells Fargo only. Be here working on new feature for the customer dashboard that require integrating both rfql and rest kps. So, my PA billiard we would stick? The rest for Simplicity. While I felt that a hybrid approach like using graphql for complex Mr data. And rest. For a simpler input, it would be better. So the task what we needed to agree on API strategy here before starting implementation. Since both back and service contracts and front-end queries would depend on it. All that actions I took was, like, I first acknowledge my peers concerns about complexity and team learning with graphql, so I gathered metrics and real examples for our current rest endpoints are showing that fetching nested data often required three to four round trips. Words, so I have created a small proof of concept. Showing that some dashboards data fetching in my stream. So, we reviewed this side by side in a technical design meeting along with the trace trade-off in caching, error handling, and schema maintenance. So I propose the com, a compromise here, like, adopt a graphql for data, heavy composite queries. Uh, keep rest for single or resource endpoints. So, the result was the team agreed to hybrid model. This registered damage dashboard loads. Seconds, and by 30 percent while keeping implementation complexity are manageable. My peers? Later acknowledge that.\n\nAnd. I can say that seeing real performance gauge and clear maintenance plan help change their prospect too. So, in this case, this approach becomes the reference pattern for other types building complex customer facing UV components. Meant this, so I have learned that influencing peer isn't about winning an argument, right? It's just about finding common ground through data prototypes and help with their concerns.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nMakes sense. So, how did you alleviate? Wait, what were their main concerns? About graphql.\n\nSo, yeah, what were they?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay, so gracias consons or layer, so a constant and consensual so? There was. And we. Then there was a learning team for the team, right? So not everything was familiar with graphql queries, like a resolve and implementation. So they worried it. Uh, it would slow the team down at the start.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, like there\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWas an increased complexity. Actually, uh, setting up graphics or adds another layer on the.\n\nExisting resting processor, so we have. And there was a secure like there was some security Councils to here. So, specific endpoints are more flexible, but that means. They can potentially request more data than internet.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI'm definitely I'm very familiar with graphql, um. So, what was your did they not have any concerns over the long-term maintenance of maintaining both rest endpoints and graphql endpoints?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI can say, uh, when coming. Um. So? This part. And. The thing is, uh, one of the biggest concern. Uh, in one of my page. Maintenance and cost of supporting both rest and graph rank points. Their point was that over time, we could end up with duplicate logic in two different API layers, which could increase technical depth like required more regression testing and. Duplicate onboarding for new developers,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThey were also concerned about documentation here. If they understand the Rascal contracts, uh, we aren't keeping. So,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThen why, why use if the main concern is having two different Tech Stacks? Why was there an alternate option to just create, um, rest a rest endpoint specifically to solve the query patterns of the heavy doubt data? Quests, like, why did you need graphql instead of a bespoke rest API?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo I can say that.\n\nThe reason why? Editor was actually. There was actually. If the only multiple cost to get the needed data like, we could keep the stack purely restocurrency. Team might still choose graphql instead of only few recipes that are its flexibility, like lines can Define exactly what fields they need without back and\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHaving to\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCreate a new endpoint for every variant. And so. Like, instead of creating say like a customer details. And all these basically call these things can handle all those through a single schema graph. Yeah,\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSo is,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, the I understand the reason why you would want a graphql endpoint because you can just fetch whatever data you want. Not all of the data. But the point you made at the beginning was that you implemented it because it would allow you to reduce multiple round-trip calls, right? So, why did you not just create an API that would solve specifically? Um, that round trip call issue. Instead of implementing a new API layer, like, what was the, what was the key factor that said, no, we're not going to create an API specifically to solve this. We're going to create an entire layer, right? So, what was, what was that key factor?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo? We couldn't have a build a single. And I can say the thing is what I thought for this. Is? We weren't just have one fixture problem here. So our dashboards? Need change frequently? Because our product manager kept adding new combination of fields, filters, and related resources? If we, when we just restrain point for everybody, listen. We have ended up creating and maintaining multiple composite and endpoints over time, like repeating development, testing documentation, work every time. So with graphql, uh, we could just.\n\nAnd I can say that we were creating a new backend point every time there are a requirement. And Logics, uh, I can say the UA requirement shifted and give the backend knowledge centralized. While still reducing over fetching and under fetching, so deciding factor wasn't performance alone. It was long term adopority, I can say.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight. Okay, well, that's just. I guess that didn't come out when you were talking about it earlier. Um. Okay. Cool! Um. So, let's go ahead and move over to the, uh. Coding part of this. Do you have the Live code link?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYes, yes, I do have. Okay.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSorry,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nBen,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nNo worries.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nAre you\n\n[Speaker 1]\nGoing to be using, uh, JavaScript, today?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, Java,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nJava, okay?\n\nAll right.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nGive me one second.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nDigital,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYep, looks like you're in, oh. Kicked me out, God dang it! All right.\n\nSo, I pasted the prompt up here. Um. Go ahead and give it a read. Um.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nRepresents\n\n[Speaker 2]\nA question.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSo, we have\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAn array of seeds. Also, cities outwarded up, right? So, one represents.\n\nSo sleep is occupied and zero reference. It is empty.\n\nSo, what we can do is? For each seat, we can store the distance for the from the nearest ones to left side. If there are no? Right on the left? So you can keep it as Infinity or large number.\n\nSo, then one right, low lock now, so what we can do is? Uh, from each seat, we can store distance from nearest one. Right side. So again, if there is no one on the right? Uh, keep it as Infinity.\n\nSo command distance I can say for each mtcp 0. So, find the minimum of left distance and right distance, so that's the distance to the call closest person. Also the coolest person. We can drag the sheep that maximize the minimum distance.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay. Go ahead and coat it up.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nWhat\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWe can do is we can have a class now.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nI'm saying, like\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThe oblique.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nMaximize\n\n[Speaker 2]\nDistance.\n\nGlue just like this, you can say. Them. Inside this, we can have a method.\n\nYou can find.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSo, image.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nJust equals.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nYou\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCan sound like this.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nAnd what\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWill be like that?\n\nAnd last for. 2 divided equals minus.\n\nIt's done.\n\nIt's, it's not.\n\n[Speaker 3]\n+ 2.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWhat we can do is here. You don't need to have this.\n\n[Speaker 3]\n-1.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, fill right?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUm, find the best seat.\n\nSo,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNow what we can do is?\n\nUh, in this C, it is equals to minus 1. On Max distance equals to -1.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSheets of y\n\n[Speaker 2]\n=?\n\nSo, paying people? Support again.\n\nUh, yeah, it should work, I think.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll right. Let's take a look through it.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUm,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll right, so? Starting at line 21.22, so. Tell me about the things your initial initializing and why you're initializing them.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, the thing here? We store the number of seats.\n\nOkay, sure. Then, we we allocate two arrows arrays to pole, like, for each position on the distance to nearest top, quite seed on the left.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, the what is the left distance and right distance store?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, it allocates two arrows to hold.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nLike for each question. The distance for the distance to nearest occupied shade around itself.\n\nAnd, and right, for the right distance, okay, and it's\n\n[Speaker 1]\nFrom. So, like, what is the left distance is the distance from the last person?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSorry. And\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo the left distance array stores the distance from the last laughs person.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, the distance I can say from the last left person you are asking, or yes for\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThe for the left distance array. What it, what is it? What are the numbers that storing represent?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIt's gonna be. Get the story. Uh, represent is for the left distance array. It remains, like, how far is the close occupied the left, uh, including, like, uh, in my own position if it's occupied?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay. And what's the leftmost value going to be?\n\nSo, the\n\n[Speaker 2]\nLefts are most valuable. It's gonna be like? I can say here if you see. Now, the leftmost value will be like, uh, it's something like zero, I can say. Uh.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhy would the leftmost value be zero? Why would the leftmost value be zero?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, I understand.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, but why? Why is the leftmost value zero? I'm asking so. You said the leftmost value in the left distance array is going to be zero.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWhy is\n\n[Speaker 1]\nIt going to be zero?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThat's because. The index 0. But the city is occupied one, so just. Distance of the closest portion on the left is zero. Like, you are already sitting there.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight. So, if someone's sitting there, then it's zero.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, if someone sitting there, that's zero. Yeah, what if no one's\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSitting there?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo if nobody is sitting there, I can say the value gonna be. Uh, if we can say, there is. No one here occupied. Say to the left of the current position.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight. So then, what would the value be? So, the value\n\n[Speaker 2]\nGonna be like?\n\nIt will be the last large number, so no person found on the left, right?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSure.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo we can say the well, if nobody is there, we can mention it as Infinity.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, you usually n plus one. So, like, we use a larger number instead of mass.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay. Makes sense. All right now. Walk me through what the.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUm. The loop on line 27 does.\n\n7.7.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, uh, it's start scanning from the left length. So, see if the current seat is occupied. I'll update the last operator I and distance to Lost. To and discuss the left occupied CT 0, so. So, if the current state is empty, so the distance to the nearest left occupiest is, uh, is like a minus last one of the pipe. So, and if if none has been seen last, half point is minus infinity. So this becomes a large a very large number so effectively. You can say no left.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay. And so, what are you setting the values to if there's somebody sitting in the seat then?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo the values if somebody? Should be in the seat eyes. I can say.\n\nLike, we are storing like some in left to the right past. Now, we have lost occurate equals so far. Occupations left distance of five. We are having a zero, right? Also, we are having a zero in.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nIf there's a person in the seat, then it'll be a zero distance.\n\nAll right. So then? I think that makes sense, and then you're saying that the right to left is similar in the way it works. Correct?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, yes.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, so then walk me through what the loop on line 54 does.\n\n[Speaker 2]\n154, I can see.\n\nSo here, what happens is? If it gets over all c's to choose the best empty one.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight, how does it do that?\n\nBut how does it? How does it figure that out?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, so it only counts as entities. The thing is. So for?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI the distance to the closest person is the minimum of left and the right distance. And if the seat closed person distance? Is better than any scene so forth. If it is, so far, we can record it, right?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo then real quick? Can you show me what the? Um, the left array. And the right array would look like. For the example here. At the top. So, on line 13 and 14, if you could just fill those two in? For the example I gave you.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSo, you\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWant me to? I should do like?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI mean, you should be able to fill it out. By just the pseudo, you should know how the pseudocode works so you can just fill in these arrays for me so that I understand exactly what's going to be here. Right?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSo left, right\n\n[Speaker 2]\nPass? I can say.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSo\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIt could be zero.\n\nThen we have 51 - 0. Then I equals to 2 minus 4.\n\nRight equals to?\n\nSo, you want me to show how I got these values?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nNo, it makes sense. Um, can you do it again for? This array.\n\n[Speaker 2]\n0, 0, 1, 0.\n\nYeah,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh, you can start filling it in.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nPush, it will be 11.\n\nSo T - 0 and?\n\n0, {comma}, 1.\n\nAnd 8 minus 5 in V3.\n\nYou hear what TV can do is?\n\nAnd we have a -4.\n\nYeah, can you see this? Ben,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah. So what's the right? Answer in this scenario.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nUh,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nGive me one second. I didn't hear your problem.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhat is that can be the answer?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo I can say. Both are right.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nBoth are right.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nYeah.\n\nSo?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhy is the best seat index zero?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI can say that.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nSee.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYour code is, it is because of how the distance, uh. In left distance and right distance come out when you take. So interesting question math dot mean lab distance of I comma right distance of I?\n\nSo I can say, uh, let's check index 0 left distance of 0 equals to. Infinity. Uh, and right distance of 0 equals to 2 and\n\n[Speaker 3]\nThe\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNearest equation of math dot Min, uh, infinity comma to equation 2.\n\nThe max level distance is and both index 0 and index 7 have it. Uh, if you are? Is, then it will pick the first seat or then reaches the Mac resistance with season at zero.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo? I'm not asking why your code does, and I'm asking why you coded it to do that.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI\n\n[Speaker 3]\nCan say that.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThat we. That's what. We get. We get the best seat, right? So, if you want to pick the right most one in a time? So change greater than to greater than or equal to, or if you want.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYes, but okay, I'm just curious. I'm not curious about how I would change the code to make it happen. I'm just curious why that is the case. Like, why did we code it that way?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo?\n\nI can say that.\n\nGive me one second. Let me think about it.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, it's fine. I think we're actually out of time. Um,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI don't know. Give me a second.\n\nUh, I I'll finish the answer, uh, maybe it's happening. And the reason, it's correct. That's why we are actually tied to how we normally write. Is find Max Loops. So why fix index 0? I can say we start with Max distance equals to minus one. Uh, as soon as we find the nearest empty seat with the nearest bigger than Max distance RV update. So once, uh, we set math Christians to a certain value, uh, we never replace it. We see the same value again because the condition is greater than or not greater than or equals to. That means, uh, I can say the first ship that hits the max distance becomes based. Letter seeds have the same Max range, how we ignore them. So, why, if you ask me why it's correct the way as this, uh, the deliberate default choice, uh, in a lot of fine match problems? Speaking of first occurrence of the max respectable and awards extra time breaking walks.\n\nYeah, so\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYou'd basically just followed a standard fine Max that you, you already know how to code up.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYes, okay, that's right.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nCool, all right? Well, we are out of time.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWe are already actually technically over time. Is there any questions you have for me real quick before I go?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, okay. Did you work on, uh, any development that means any product development part?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nDid I ever do product development?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYes,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm, I have done a lot of product development. Yes, I've back in my time in Alexa in primary.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nHow did you gather the feedback from the customers if you? If you work on something that? Uh, that you, you're welcome.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHow do I gather feedback? Well, it depends on who my customers are. You know, key number one is to understand your customers. Um, so when I was in Prime air primarily, I would go talk to the maintenance technicians. I would just walk into their labs and bug them. For when I worked in Alexa. A lot of times, we had entire teams that were dedicated to going and collecting user feedback, uh, be it via surveys or consuming emails that people sent in about things that they didn't like. So, there it really does depend, but it is important that you figure out how to get in contact with your customers, no matter what it is that you're building.\n\nThanks, take it then. Yeah. Cool, all right. Well, good luck with the rest of your interviews. Thank you so much.\n\nOh my God.","numLines":751,"startLine":1,"totalLines":751}}}

Yes,\n     3→\n     4→[Speaker 2]\n     5→It is, how are you doing? I\n     6→\n     7→[Speaker 1]\n     8→Was doing hard today. Nice to meet you.\n     9→\n    10→[Speaker 2]\n    11→Nice to meet you, too, all right. Give me a second here, just getting situated.\n    12→\n    13→Um, just opening up.\n    14→\n    15→[Speaker 1]\n    16→Can you hear me okay?\n    17→\n    18→[Speaker 2]\n    19→Yeah, your your voice is a little echoey, but I think it'll be okay.\n    20→\n    21→Um, alrighty. Cool! So, let's go ahead and get started. It looks like I am your last interview for the day, so I hope the other interviews have been going well.\n    22→\n    23→[Speaker 1]\n    24→Yeah, thank you.\n    25→\n    26→[Speaker 3]\n    27→All\n    28→\n    29→[Speaker 1]\n    30→Right.\n    31→\n    32→[Speaker 2]\n    33→So? The way I like to do this. Everyone should be doing the same. Now, I'm going to ask you some just questions about yourself and about some experiences you've had in work. And then, about halfway through, I'm going to cut over, and I'm going to ask you a coding question, so I'm going to try to keep tight on the timelines there. I like to say it about five minutes at the end just to answer any questions you might have for me. Um, but let's go ahead and just do introductions. So, tell me a little about yourself.\n    34→\n    35→[Speaker 1]\n    36→I come from Aerospace industry background, so I did mechanical engineering when I was in undergrad, worked at Boeing and lock kit, and decided to pursue computer science, so I went to school for full time. And here I am.\n    37→\n    38→[Speaker 2]\n    39→All right. Oh, sorry, I dropped something. I got my pen on the floor. Yeah, no worries, all right. Um, so, yeah, my name is Ben. I'm a senior software engineer, uh, with Amazon. I've been here for, um, about eight years. Um, I've worked in a variety of different places. I started off in Alexa. And then I actually moved over to, uh, prime air, the the Drone delivery company, where I was working with the drones. So, a little bit of Aerospace? From there, I moved into operator tooling. So, building out tools so that people could handle their own calls easier. Um, and then finally moving over to. The golden path team, which is where I am now, where we kind of just make recommendations about. How you should be building services at Amazon? You know, based off of the use cases you're trying to accomplish? So awesome!\n    40→\n    41→[Speaker 1]\n    42→Yeah.\n    43→\n    44→[Speaker 2]\n    45→Sorry, I'm getting slacks. Let me. Okay, no worries, this? Yeah, I'm just gonna update this to people. Leave me alone! Cool! All right. So? I, I'm just going to go ahead and jump in to make sure I give you as much time as possible. Um, so? Can you, uh, tell me about a time? When you needed a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job well. This does not have to have anything to do with software. By the way, feel free to use examples from, you know, your time in Aerospace.\n    46→\n    47→[Speaker 1]\n    48→Okay. Yeah, so yeah, yeah. I was told that, like, I could use notes, right? So, oh yeah, absolutely.\n    49→\n    50→[Speaker 2]\n    51→I don't care.\n    52→\n    53→[Speaker 1]\n    54→So I will use this example, uh, from my second job in Charleston, Boeing, Charleston, uh. So there was a project, uh, there was a project for, uh, typically for earlier career people because where you, uh, you can, like, work. Then you actually give you a charge, like a charge line, like up to maybe, like a couple hours, because in aerospace industry like you charge, you have to like, log in your time. You know, like, six minute increment time also like, yeah, sure.\n    55→\n    56→A couple hours. So, like, on a weekly basis to work on this, like a project that's outside of your like, uh, like you're like a discipline, or yeah. And so, I mean, things like, uh, like some of the, uh, tests that projects include, like quadcopters, like building it, or I mean, obviously, they give you some, like tools, so, uh, but? The project that I was working on was, uh, it was to utilize air drag of the aircraft, uh, to enhance efficiency because Air Track each bed offered because it's gonna air more air direct will, uh, increase fuel.\n    57→\n    58→[Speaker 2]\n    59→Yeah, yeah, so?\n    60→\n    61→[Speaker 1]\n    62→Uh, so there was a local team in Charleston or consisted of like, early, like early trigger people. And there was a like product development team in, like Southern California, so we were supposed to accordion with them. So, the objective was to. To design the like engine, whether it can be just. It's very open, and it can be electrical or pure mechanical, and you just have to place the engine, uh, in like a certain location to maximize it. So it's very like, mostly disciplinary, like a project, and it event to, uh, for the when you hit the team meeting. We actually decide to just make it a pure mechanical, so it ended up actually being like a pure gear design type type.\n    63→\n    64→Team, and it's very specialized work for, like, a care design, a pure mechanical in general. So, we, for the first couple meetings there was no progress, and we just keep postponing and we will try to like fighting experts slash subject matter expertise as me or, and one day, I was looking through the like the list of the subject layer experts, and I found one guy.\n    65→\n    66→Uh, like the mechanical engineer like working in Arizona, and he had like a pay. At Boeing, you can see they were like profile of, like people, always their experience if they updated. And then I reached out to him, and he turned out that years many years of experience, so designing gears in general, uh. So I started a meeting with him, and I had some I, and he explained, and yeah, he transferred some of the like.\n    67→\n    68→A follow-up meeting with him and trying to gain more knowledge. And then, eventually, he provided some, uh, like some template, for which could be useful for our project. And then, uh, when I received when I received the template I shared with the team, and also I was going through a template line by line, uh, it was the Excel template, by the way, line by line. And then I was asked I, I'll call him up, or even like, send him a message. If you find any questions and I even tailored me, tailor it to.\n    69→\n    70→There, we made a good progress and. Uh, we were able to coordinate with the project development team in Southern California, and we made sure the design and we were fine. We were able to finalize the engine engine like a placemat, uh, in the aircraft, and uh, but I ended up transferring to, uh, like different team like internal transfer to us. I did not get a chance to like continue working on that, uh, but? When I was there, like, we made a significant like, uh, yeah, I mean progress, uh, because of that, like a template, and some of them, I'll transfer, and, uh, what I heard after I left, uh, maybe a couple like, maybe about a year later, was that the project? Like, go very well, and they were actually even thinking about, like having a like contract official contract with NASA.\n    71→\n    72→[Speaker 2]\n    73→That's pretty cool. All right, so. Now, so once you now that you've completed the project, is there anything that you would do differently? What were the key learnings you got from this experience?\n    74→\n    75→[Speaker 1]\n    76→I would say, definitely like any, like, major work. It's not something you can do it individually alone. Uh, so I highly, uh. Of value, like a teamwork, or I mean, even more so after that experience, and especially, uh. Also diversity as well because I mean, we nobody had experience with Social Security desires, so and but we found someone like with that experience, so it definitely helped helped us, like along the way. So there was a very crucial and lastly, in terms of, uh, while I do it differently. Maybe I was like trying to more proactively? Maybe going through the list of like a people on the directories and try to find someone sooner instead of just keep like staying in the limbo because we look, we kind of missed it. Like, quite a bit of time. Just yeah, like being on your side. Undecisive. So, yeah,\n    77→\n    78→[Speaker 2]\n    79→That makes sense. Did you learn anything about gear design like from this, or did you mostly rely on this other guy? I'm kind of. I'm kind of curious.\n    80→\n    81→[Speaker 1]\n    82→Complex. It's like going back to college like machine design work for mechanical engineering, like using the textbook. But yeah, sometimes. I mean, if, uh, I, I have a like, I have a belief like, uh, any jobs, especially in big corporate. I feel like, it's, uh, like, even if people without background, uh, can be like taught and learnable, uh, given, like, enough time and training, but for gear design. In my opinion, I mean, that's not something you can really. Like, yeah, be like, learned in like a in like a?\n    83→\n    84→Something which I am grateful for, but I mean trying to do it from scratch. Yeah, there's no\n    85→\n    86→[Speaker 2]\n    87→Way.\n    88→\n    89→Yeah. Did you have to machine it, or were you like? So, it sounds like you actually had to machine the gear specifically for the task, rather than being able to find something that worked off the shelf. Is that right?\n    90→\n    91→[Speaker 1]\n    92→No everything's, just. So, I mean, everything's kind of like. Especially though I did a structural analysis, uh, yeah, most, I mean, it's just a inferior computer like doing design and analysis pretty much so nothing, uh? And so on, but I mean, I mentioned machine design because that's one of the college courses here, where they actually teach you like a little bit about, like a gear design like, yeah, there's like a bunch of like values, and like, uh, each kind of like reference material as well, like so when you want to design something like it was kind of like a gear. So yeah, there's like all this, like a peace ratio for the gears and all that stuff. Yeah, inside the boat, which is great reference.\n    93→\n    94→[Speaker 2]\n    95→Cool. I think that makes a lot of sense to me. Um. Awesome! That's so fun. That's a fun, little story. I, uh, I love all the soul side projects you can get done. All right. So let's, let's move on to the next one here. Can you describe a time? When you needed to influence a peer who had a differing opinion on a shared goal.\n    96→\n    97→[Speaker 1]\n    98→Yeah, I'll use an example for, like, from my uh graduate class for computer science so? I was taking a classical data structures and software design class, and there was a group project at the end with a total group of like two people, uh. So, just so, just me, and like, like, a partner. Also, it was the software design project with, uh, so the data was, uh, like massive covid-19 data, and we were, uh, we were supposed to follow the design specifications uh, such as like antier architecture, and there were some requirements for, like each data.\n    99→\n   100→By meeting all those specification requirements there, so I just had a more bandwidth. So, because my partner was like working full time and he was taking two classes, which was yeah, which was insane. Yeah, so I jumped on it, and I purchased, like architect and system design, and I went through the details and came up with the uml diagram for the, uh, for the project, and I split up the work, and we like continued working and my.\n   101→\n   102→Over engineer everything. So, yeah, we have some. Yeah, we have some discussion on uml diagram and he wants to get change and I'll reach because I mean, I wanted his inputs as well, so that was totally okay. But there was a strong disagreement on data structure, because in one of the like, a data and data analysis requirement, uh, zip like, there's a data pertains to like zip code or for, like, Kobe, like United data, and this, like, set of data, just doesn't doesn't.\n   103→\n   104→A partner keep insisting that we should use streamlab and, but we don't, because it doesn't have to be sorry. We don't have to stream a hashmap, it's like a faster because stream app for lookup is like log n of time like, yeah, time, complexity, uh. So, what I did was I barked up as? I, I just marked up that we need to revisit later. If there's a if it takes a hit on performance, because like that application. A lot takes like couple minutes to actually get working, and there's a time limit about the project, because if if you exceed the time, or you get zero on the functionality portion, because it's like 30 of the like, overall grade. So, ah, yeah, so? Like a merch, all the files, and uh, able to get it working, and we were able to. I mean, it was, at that point. It was more of optional whether to keep the data structure as is, uh, keep it as treatment or versus, uh, like a hashmat, so, but I. In general. Like, uh, like, every time I have some disagreement, or like, I want to like, convey, like, what I, what, I think, and I want the other party to like, compete, what, I think, and we try to have a healthy discussion. And I mean, it's not really about, like, a like, an ego battle. In my opinion, I just want to, uh, personally speaking, like, oh, I mean, I'm totally fine. Like, if somebody has a better idea, I mean, as long as it's I just, it's just available like, who's, like, right, and better? I mean, that's all I really care about. So, for your assistance, it was just just.\n   105→\n   106→That I was, like, right, for sure. I'll definitely, uh, yeah, voice. Yeah, I would definitely like, yeah, like, voice up about, uh, my stance, and try to, uh, convince, uh, the other party on that.\n   107→\n   108→[Speaker 2]\n   109→Makes sense.\n   110→\n   111→[Speaker 1]\n   112→So\n   113→\n   114→[Speaker 2]\n   115→Then? The so just a I'm just going to summarize a little bit here to make sure I understand. Like you, there was. You built this data structure program to analyze a bunch of data and basically the you were worried that the data structure of the day wanted to use wasn't going to be effective enough or rather efficient enough to complete the analysis of all the data in time because you were using one structure over the other. Yeah, and then in the end it, were you able to run it against the test server? I assume there's a test server to verify that it did, in fact, run in time. It\n   116→\n   117→[Speaker 1]\n   118→Was a pure static, uh, like, I mean, like, nothing like, I mean, it was just like a like, static, like project. So, like,\n   119→\n   120→[Speaker 2]\n   121→Okay, yeah,\n   122→\n   123→[Speaker 1]\n   124→Internet or anything, but the data was, like, humongous, uh. So, I was, my main worry was, it's gonna like, probably serve as a bottleneck for that, like using data structure, but but I didn't really. I could have measured it, uh, but I know Java, like, uh, there's like time, like, excuses. It's not that accurate, but I could have done it. But at that point. I mean, we were just happy with that, because yeah, I mean, we could tell.\n   125→\n   126→Very finicky, so my partner again willing to change, keep changing stuff, and then you start finicky. And then he just later realized that apologized to me, because, yeah, because it just stopped working. So, we had to roll it back to the previous version working version and then just move. Move on.\n   127→\n   128→[Speaker 2]\n   129→Okay, well, it sounds like you were able to like support your teammate, uh? Didn't agree with what he was doing, but it ended up working out because you guys had a, you know, a good working relationship because of it, and so you were able to work through it. Okay, that that makes sense to me, makes it makes a lot of sense. And so then. I'm guessing you guys passed that, uh? That course, for sure.\n   130→\n   131→[Speaker 1]\n   132→Yeah, I mean, because almost like a perfect score, I mean, we got some points to accept for, like, something like, very minority, but we got almost like close to hundreds.\n   133→\n   134→[Speaker 2]\n   135→I like that. All right, um? So? Can you answer one more question for me?\n   136→\n   137→Can you give me an example of a tough or critical piece of feedback that you've received?\n   138→\n   139→Let\n   140→\n   141→[Speaker 1]\n   142→Me see.\n   143→\n   144→I'm not sure if it really falls under critical. I mean, all it's kind of a mixed up critical slash, uh, like disagreement, uh, but I'll go ahead. And yeah, use this example. So this was, uh, this was my second job, like in the Charleston again. Also, the main job was the factory support slash material review board. So, whenever there's like damage, or like down performers like, part like, uh, for the airframe part, uh, I, as an analyst, had to like, review the repair option and?\n   145→\n   146→Existing repair option or come up with, like, better repair option as, like, send it, uh, send a repair package to the shop. Yeah, so there's a there's an area called flight line where, like all the aircraft is already assembled and ready to be like delivered to the aircraft and. The job came from the flight line area and the engineer from there. Like, uh, reached out to me in urgent manner, saying that it's like, there's a damage, and they're like secondary panel like secondary panel, each still serviceable, like without the like, a secondary part, but still, like, oh, I mean, we are selling the brand new aircraft. So, I mean, the parks there had Fair to be, like, yeah, brand new, and like, tfx free, right? So, and so, I had to analyze or like and review the damage, but, uh. But the engineer, like? Call who reached out to me, told me that there's a prior like analysis on similar damage in similar location, and he, he thinks it's like good to go without, like a like, extensive repair. Uh, so I actually got a chance to look at the repair thoroughly, and I compare it to my, uh, my the damage that I'm like, currently like, analyzing, and realized that it's not, uh? Like, although it's similar like a damage and like a similar location, but the damage that I was analyzing was that the like? The most critical like location where, like the I mean, any damage in the location. It's not like feasible to repair, so, uh, when I reach out to the when I, I mean, after I run through analysis, and uh, got back to him, and he was a little bit like, uh, like a little bit like argument tip about that. He, he thought that. A prior repair analysis follows like a very similar to mine, and he said he thought he could get by. So I had to actually had to, uh, I mean, after, um, after exhausting all my all the options from my side. I set up a meeting with my lead and my manager, and then I informed like this situation, and then even, uh, and against the engine from the fly line to yeah, uh, come to this meeting, and I explained my findings and allowances and. Is repairable, so I, and then obviously he was not happy with it, but he had to go with it, but I did. Uh, provide the option so. So, unfortunately, we have to scrap the part, right? But, uh, I suggest I propose the solution that we could actually borrow that part from the one of the aircraft inside the inner, because that part is interchangeable. So, so there's no, uh, delay, or anything like that, we just, uh, yeah, borrowed it from there and then. So basically, uh. Uh, safety and quality is the top priority, because I mean, in the long term, sense, like, imagine that panel gets placed and ends. What if it falls like down the road, then maybe hit somebody? I mean, the company will be liable for like a lawsuit, so I pretty much like mitigate the possibility of like low suit for the company. And yeah, so.\n   147→\n   148→[Speaker 2]\n   149→Nice so! So, it sounds like you ended up doing the right thing for the company and to make sure that the team was, you know, working together. So, that sounds all good to me.\n   150→\n   151→[Speaker 1]\n   152→Cool.\n   153→\n   154→[Speaker 2]\n   155→Thank you, um. Those are all the questions I have. Do you have the Live code link?\n   156→\n   157→[Speaker 1]\n   158→Sure. Yep.\n   159→\n   160→[Speaker 2]\n   161→All right. Um.\n   162→\n   163→Sorry, I have to sign in.\n   164→\n   165→[Speaker 1]\n   166→Yeah, I'll refresher when it's ready. Yeah, it says session is currently closed. Just okay,\n   167→\n   168→[Speaker 2]\n   169→Are you using Java?\n   170→\n   171→[Speaker 1]\n   172→Yes,\n   173→\n   174→[Speaker 2]\n   175→All right.\n   176→\n   177→[Speaker 1]\n   178→So, I'm just going to paste the\n   179→\n   180→[Speaker 2]\n   181→Interview question here.\n   182→\n   183→[Speaker 1]\n   184→Okay, I see the question, uh, so print of view of a binary tree is seen from below 583.\n   185→\n   186→22, 25.\n   187→\n   188→5, 10, 3, 12, so are we just skipping? Note 20 and like node eight?\n   189→\n   190→[Speaker 2]\n   191→So? If you can picture this, you're you're viewing the tree from below and looking straight up, right? So? Um, if I am in? This position. Oh,\n   192→\n   193→[Speaker 1]\n   194→That's not the pipe\n   195→\n   196→[Speaker 2]\n   197→This position right here, right where I put that pipe? If you look straight up, you can see the 10. And the 10 is actually blocking your view of the eight, right? Yep, and so that's why you are. It's not that you're skipping the eight. It's that you cannot see the eight from your vantage point, right? Okay.\n   198→\n   199→[Speaker 1]\n   200→What about 20? Is it? Is that the same as like a three blocking 20 correct? Okay. Oh, this is interesting. Question, yeah, let me think a little bit.\n   201→\n   202→Yeah, I'm just, uh, like labeling the nodes like this index. So, yeah, see if I can, like, here, find some like a hint search pattern.\n   203→\n   204→Five.\n   205→\n   206→Okay, I think, uh. I guess the reason why the output is like, that is, because for if there's like. So, for instance, for eight, if there's a?\n   207→\n   208→If there's a node on the right? I mean, if you have children like or right children and right, children has like left children then.\n   209→\n   210→You omit this one. I guess for the rude as well. So if there's a children and then?\n   211→\n   212→Left children, and then there's. Left Right into this right left, okay? Left, right, right left?\n   213→\n   214→So, what's\n   215→\n   216→[Speaker 2]\n   217→The approach you're thinking about taking? Just help me understand where you're at. Yeah,\n   218→\n   219→[Speaker 1]\n   220→Just so, maybe run through, like, uh, just like maybe one of the like, the graph traversal algorithm, and then, uh, so if it has?\n   221→\n   222→If it has like a like, one of their children, for instance. If so, this one has like a so eight has right children, and this children has, uh, eight children on the other side. Then, you omit this, uh.\n   223→\n   224→This one so? For 20, let's say, even like, let's say, if, like, uh, the branch of like three and ten doesn't exist. But for, let's say, like a 2020, like a, uh? Like, like, children on each left. So, basically, this one has. 20th, right, children. And there's opposite, uh, there's the children in the opposite direction, which is left. So then we apply 20, but I mean, am I missing something, uh, in terms of like solving it or? Well, I think that\n   225→\n   226→[Speaker 2]\n   227→The you can solve this really with any either either of the graph traversals, right?\n   228→\n   229→[Speaker 1]\n   230→Okay it,\n   231→\n   232→[Speaker 2]\n   233→It really is, you know, you can do whatever. Um. I think the important piece to keep track of right is, how do you? Keep track of if something else? Is lower in the tree and in the same. Like position. Vertically, right?\n   234→\n   235→So, what I mean by that is like? If I, if I pretended, for example, that, uh, this position here was zero. And this position is one, and this position is two. How do I? All I really want to know, is, is something else? What is the lowest thing in position one? Right?\n   236→\n   237→Same thing is true for, like? Minus one, right?\n   238→\n   239→[Speaker 1]\n   240→So?\n   241→\n   242→[Speaker 2]\n   243→But which would be three, and then this would be, you know, minus two. The the alignment's not working out very well, but you understand what I'm saying. Um. I think that might be an easier way for you to think about. How do you maintain State as you Traverse the tree?\n   244→\n   245→[Speaker 1]\n   246→I guess, like I, I guess, so we can do like? Keep trackable levels, right?\n   247→\n   248→[Speaker 2]\n   249→You could keep track of levels. Yeah,\n   250→\n   251→[Speaker 1]\n   252→Your level so?\n   253→\n   254→I think if it has, yeah, I think my challenge is that, how should I like, uh, output, like, in such a way that, like, it starts from 5, 10, 3, 20 to 25, so I mean, initially, I don't think there's an inner Trevor traversal pre-order and post, like, called post order, but? Has to be in order. Doesn't seem like.\n   255→\n   256→Because in order, you'll be like five eight.\n   257→\n   258→822.\n   259→\n   260→Zero negative one?\n   261→\n   262→Uh, at least our International. I'll just set up to like skeleton code.\n   263→\n   264→Is there any like specific property of the tree that I need to come for, or um? I don't.\n   265→\n   266→[Speaker 2]\n   267→I don't really think so. I think that what you so a good approach that you might be able to take right is? Keeping when you're doing, or which, which traversal? Or do you plan on using?\n   268→\n   269→[Speaker 1]\n   270→Maybe in order to travel travel for like ptfs because I mean the order matters, right, right? So?\n   271→\n   272→[Speaker 2]\n   273→It's, it's really the the things that matter, right, are the level each note is at and the vertical distance? From the root of each. Uh, or horizontal distance from the root of each. Node so that you can figure out whatever the lowest level one is at that horizontal distance is the one that you want to print, right?\n   274→\n   275→[Speaker 1]\n   276→Sorry, could you repeat it one more time? Yeah,\n   277→\n   278→[Speaker 2]\n   279→So if we're looking at the example above, right?\n   280→\n   281→When we, when we Traverse the entire graph and process every node, we're going to have two different values that would be at negative two. Right. That would be eight and ten. Correct?\n   282→\n   283→Yep, okay. So, since we have both 8 and 10 in the negative two, uh, distance from the root? We then need to process which one is on a lower level.\n   284→\n   285→And so, by processing which one is on a lower level, you just need to keep track of the depth. Um. Of the node in the tree. Right,\n   286→\n   287→[Speaker 1]\n   288→Why would it be so that? Why would it like eight and ten be like a negative two? Uh, because it's the distance from the root, right? Oh, sorry,\n   289→\n   290→[Speaker 2]\n   291→It would be it would be negative one, sorry.\n   292→\n   293→[Speaker 1]\n   294→I was,\n   295→\n   296→[Speaker 2]\n   297→I was, uh, I was misspeaking there, but yes, they would both be in the negative one slot. Um, and so you just need to apply eight,\n   298→\n   299→[Speaker 1]\n   300→Uh, I mean. So, the distance from eight to I mean from the root to eight is negative one and then distance from the like. A root to 10 is would be two right negative two, I guess.\n   301→\n   302→[Speaker 2]\n   303→So, if you, if I look at this? Um. There are. There are a couple values in the way there. There's the. There's the. There's the three, and then there's the ten, right? So, this is at root position zero, right?\n   304→\n   305→[Speaker 1]\n   306→Yep,\n   307→\n   308→[Speaker 2]\n   309→The eight we move one to the left, so we'll call it minus one. Okay, the three. Is? These, the three moves back to the right. So, it is at root position zero.\n   310→\n   311→[Speaker 1]\n   312→Okay, because it's negative one, plus one, right, yes. And then,\n   313→\n   314→[Speaker 2]\n   315→10 moves back to the left. So, it's at root position, negative one.\n   316→\n   317→[Speaker 1]\n   318→Okay,\n   319→\n   320→[Speaker 2]\n   321→So now I can see. V like, if I look at position? What I see is I'm gonna have. And I'm gonna have ten. If I look at position? I'm gonna have two values, right? I'm gonna have eight, and I'm gonna have three. Correct? Yep, and so now. Basically, if I look at both of these values. The determining factor for which one to print? Is just going to be. Come on!\n   322→\n   323→[Speaker 1]\n   324→Sorry, I did this wrong. It says 20\n   325→\n   326→[Speaker 2]\n   327→And 3, and this is 8 and 10, yeah, so 20 and 3 are at position zero. Right?\n   328→\n   329→And so I need to pick which one is lower, which is three. And then I do the same thing for this one. So eight and ten are both at position negative one, not one negative one. And the 10 will win because it is a lower than eight.\n   330→\n   331→[Speaker 1]\n   332→Does that make sense? For negative value, I guess so, the?\n   333→\n   334→[Speaker 2]\n   335→The reason? That this one works right is eight and ten are both in. If you look at the horizontal distance from the root, right? So, like, side to side? They're, they're both in position negative one away from the root. Like, if you picture drawing a wine straight down from 20, you're gonna hit 20 and three. So, if I go one to the left and I draw a straight line, I'm going to hit 8 and I'm going to hit 10. So they're at position negative one. So what I really since I what I want to do is print the view from below? What I need to do is understand. Which of those nodes is the lowest so that I'll actually be seeing it? All right, because the. In this example is covering the eight, so you won't see it.\n   336→\n   337→[Speaker 1]\n   338→Okay, it's the lowest right.\n   339→\n   340→[Speaker 2]\n   341→The lowest one wins. Yeah.\n   342→\n   343→Does that make more sense?\n   344→\n   345→[Speaker 1]\n   346→Yeah, okay.\n   347→\n   348→[Speaker 2]\n   349→And I\n   350→\n   351→[Speaker 1]\n   352→Guess for five, yeah, let me just finish. Yeah, I guess here, probably, and for five would be negative two.\n   353→\n   354→22b1. 25 bit 2, so if over to fill up this?\n   355→\n   356→Bring it 2.\n   357→\n   358→Navigate to five.\n   359→\n   360→22, so 22. Two equals. 0.5.\n   361→\n   362→0.5.\n   363→\n   364→Five, ten, three, okay, wow.\n   365→\n   366→So I. Yeah, get the distance.\n   367→\n   368→And then, maybe there's got to be helpful help for helper function. Yeah, so. And let me.\n   369→\n   370→[Speaker 2]\n   371→There. There's not really a helper function that gives you depth of a node. Um. For trees, but I think you can just. Um. You know you. You can basically keep track of that yourself. Based off of how you're doing your traversal, right?\n   372→\n   373→[Speaker 1]\n   374→Yeah, I'm just like DFS, and then, uh, like so, uh? If it's left, you do like, and then I would probably put it in the like, uh out, can I have a global variable like a hashmere where I can keep like a try? Yeah, sure.\n   375→\n   376→Um. What I can do for\n   377→\n   378→[Speaker 2]\n   379→You here is. I can give you the. Um. This is the definition. Of a node.\n   380→\n   381→[Speaker 1]\n   382→Okay, so.\n   383→\n   384→Oops!\n   385→\n   386→If it's true.\n   387→\n   388→Well, this has to be. Integer, because we. We have to calculate.\n   389→\n   390→So, if node equals no, and we'll return.\n   391→\n   392→Resolved, initially decided to zero.\n   393→\n   394→I would add like another argument argument called value so we can keep track of the. Value as? For each recursive call, and then you can either increment or decrement. So, when node equals null, it's.\n   395→\n   396→It will return value. To initially decide, so I have to change this to. Uh.\n   397→\n   398→So,\n   399→\n   400→[Speaker 3]\n   401→Person equals DFS\n   402→\n   403→[Speaker 1]\n   404→Load stuff left.\n   405→\n   406→Okay, so because we start from the airport with each each, the distance from? Or to like a root to root of zero, so initially set it at zero, and then you run the left. And. Take from at. Then Pastor heshmer. And then you when you go to write. Increment. By one, then hashmap and.\n   407→\n   408→I think this should calculate.\n   409→\n   410→Horizontal distance. I just have to. Figure out. How to?\n   411→\n   412→To put it into the hashmer.\n   413→\n   414→John left, and then you trimmer by one. And then are you Trappers right, and you increment by one?\n   415→\n   416→You don't really need to return at this point, so I'll get rid of this. Then, when you hit. You just return. Facetus.\n   417→\n   418→Get the distance, get the horizontal map, and then. Does this. So, since you're doing a DFS?\n   419→\n   420→[Speaker 2]\n   421→How do you make sure you're not overriding a value in map.put? With something that's a higher level than it right, because you might go really deep on one side. And then. If you later process something else that was. You know above it, but your DFS hit it later. Then, how did you make sure that it didn't override the value?\n   422→\n   423→[Speaker 1]\n   424→Does that\n   425→\n   426→[Speaker 2]\n   427→Make sense? Okay.\n   428→\n   429→[Speaker 1]\n   430→I have to. I have to like, keep kind of like a visit like visited node, right?\n   431→\n   432→Nodes visit.\n   433→\n   434→Yeah, I'm gonna use hash set to keep track of the note, whether it's visited or not. So if?\n   435→\n   436→Visit that add. Note that we put.\n   437→\n   438→Did you already visited so then? It's not. It's just going to return.\n   439→\n   440→So?\n   441→\n   442→[Speaker 2]\n   443→The it's not necessarily about visiting a node again, right? It's about visiting. A vertical location. So, in in the example that you have? Um. What if I? Added in something like this. Let's see if I can make this work. Um. If I add in a 5 and then like a seven? And then I add in. Back here. Um. Of. And or well, another number that hasn't been used yet, and then another one like here. Um, that does, let's say, nine right. So technically, this nine would be covering the 10, but you would process it first.\n   444→\n   445→Right, and so what ended up happening is the nine should be the return value, but the return value is actually going to be 10.\n   446→\n   447→[Speaker 1]\n   448→Kind, I mean.\n   449→\n   450→I'm just. Like relatives in the root first.\n   451→\n   452→So, this is my Approach. I mean, I was tuning this, I mean. This helper function just calculate the oversized distance from the room and then just put it in the map, right? And then I would. Get this. How to extract the values of the map, so it will be like the distance horizontal distance to the\n   453→\n   454→[Speaker 3]\n   455→From? To the root, right, and then?\n   456→\n   457→[Speaker 1]\n   458→Um, if there's a more than like, uh, like, yeah, more than one value, then I will like, decide like, which one to go for, like the first? Is like distance? And.\n   459→\n   460→But I think, uh, maybe this my approach for calculating the distance is now, right, right?\n   461→\n   462→Yes.\n   463→\n   464→[Speaker 2]\n   465→Um. I actually think I think you're on the right track here, but unfortunately, we are just about out of time. Uh, okay, yeah. So, um, I'm gonna just copy this over. Um, and the last little bit of the interview is just for you to ask me any questions that you might have.\n   466→\n   467→[Speaker 1]\n   468→Yeah, sure. So, I watched the culture, like, at Amazon.\n   469→\n   470→[Speaker 2]\n   471→Uh, culture very much depends. Uh, team to team. It is a you know, like, so there's a very you know. We have this concept of two Pizza teams where teams should be small enough that you can feed the entire team with two large pizzas, right? But what that means is that each team effectively becomes. Um, it's a little microcosm of like culture and how it works there. There is some general overarching Amazon culture, but? A lot of your experience at Amazon is determined by the actual team. That you are working with.\n   472→\n   473→[Speaker 1]\n   474→Is literally like a work is really. It really varies from, like, what team you are like, you are in. Oh, there's many teams and I was all right. Yeah,\n   475→\n   476→[Speaker 2]\n   477→There's. There's a very wide variety of what you could be working on and what your daily work will look like, depending on the team that you're on. Even possibly tell you. What it would look like?\n   478→\n   479→[Speaker 1]\n   480→Okay, by the way, so? For someone, or like, who doesn't have any experience, or like, uh, what kind of advice do you have for someone, like, I mean, I obviously got exposure to like large database when I was working in one of the projects like working on, like, uh uh, the like, a network system project, uh, but maybe it's not even at on the like, same scale like, uh, like industrial, like, uh, code things. So, for someone like a new, uh, to the industry, like, what kind of advice do you have for people like me, like?\n   481→\n   482→[Speaker 2]\n   483→Now, it doesn't really. Matter. What you, and in my opinion, most entry-level roles. It doesn't really matter what it is that you have experience in what matters the most is the. The foundational pieces like, you know, you know how to code, you generally know how data structures work. You generally have an idea of like how apis work yada yada. The details of like the databases that are used and like? Different types of calls, a bunch of other stuff. It really is stuff that you can learn on the job, and as long as you can show that you're good at learning. Um, then? That's, that's pretty much the most important piece.\n   484→\n   485→[Speaker 1]\n   486→And. Why Amazon? So, what's your like, favorite part of Amazon, like working for Amazon? I'm not sure, like, Elise, uh, like, favorite part of like working Amazon, um,\n   487→\n   488→[Speaker 2]\n   489→Sometimes there's a little more bureaucracy than I like in order to get things done. Um, it's probably pretty moment main con, the the good thing is, is that you can influence change anywhere in the company. If you do your due diligence and show data, um, so that's always a nice thing.\n   490→\n   491→[Speaker 1]\n   492→Know what kind of like formal training. So, like, yeah, do you guys have? Is it more like, most, like, like, a like, mostly like, uh, people around the job by doing it, or do you guys actually offer? Like, formal training. I mean, I guess I come from Aerospace background, right? So, yeah, like, we have like that structured, like training courses, but I'm not sure about, like, how it works like a basically software, uh, development world?\n   493→\n   494→[Speaker 2]\n   495→You can take formal trainings. I don't think I ever have, so it is definitely entirely up to you how you want to go about learning. Um, so all right, I have to go to my next interview, but talk to you later, bye.\n   496→\n   497→Hello!\n   498→\n   499→[Speaker 3]\n   500→Hello!\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious.

Give me a second here, just getting situated.\n\nUm, just opening up.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nCan you hear me okay?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, your your voice is a little echoey, but I think it'll be okay.\n\nUm, alrighty. Cool! So, let's go ahead and get started. It looks like I am your last interview for the day, so I hope the other interviews have been going well.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, thank you.\n\n[Speaker 3]\nAll\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo? The way I like to do this. Everyone should be doing the same. Now, I'm going to ask you some just questions about yourself and about some experiences you've had in work. And then, about halfway through, I'm going to cut over, and I'm going to ask you a coding question, so I'm going to try to keep tight on the timelines there. I like to say it about five minutes at the end just to answer any questions you might have for me. Um, but let's go ahead and just do introductions. So, tell me a little about yourself.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI come from Aerospace industry background, so I did mechanical engineering when I was in undergrad, worked at Boeing and lock kit, and decided to pursue computer science, so I went to school for full time. And here I am.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAll right. Oh, sorry, I dropped something. I got my pen on the floor. Yeah, no worries, all right. Um, so, yeah, my name is Ben. I'm a senior software engineer, uh, with Amazon. I've been here for, um, about eight years. Um, I've worked in a variety of different places. I started off in Alexa. And then I actually moved over to, uh, prime air, the the Drone delivery company, where I was working with the drones. So, a little bit of Aerospace? From there, I moved into operator tooling. So, building out tools so that people could handle their own calls easier. Um, and then finally moving over to. The golden path team, which is where I am now, where we kind of just make recommendations about. How you should be building services at Amazon? You know, based off of the use cases you're trying to accomplish? So awesome!\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSorry, I'm getting slacks. Let me. Okay, no worries, this? Yeah, I'm just gonna update this to people. Leave me alone! Cool! All right. So? I, I'm just going to go ahead and jump in to make sure I give you as much time as possible. Um, so? Can you, uh, tell me about a time? When you needed a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job well. This does not have to have anything to do with software. By the way, feel free to use examples from, you know, your time in Aerospace.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay. Yeah, so yeah, yeah. I was told that, like, I could use notes, right? So, oh yeah, absolutely.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI don't care.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo I will use this example, uh, from my second job in Charleston, Boeing, Charleston, uh. So there was a project, uh, there was a project for, uh, typically for earlier career people because where you, uh, you can, like, work. Then you actually give you a charge, like a charge line, like up to maybe, like a couple hours, because in aerospace industry like you charge, you have to like, log in your time. You know, like, six minute increment time also like, yeah, sure.\n\nA couple hours. So, like, on a weekly basis to work on this, like a project that's outside of your like, uh, like you're like a discipline, or yeah. And so, I mean, things like, uh, like some of the, uh, tests that projects include, like quadcopters, like building it, or I mean, obviously, they give you some, like tools, so, uh, but? The project that I was working on was, uh, it was to utilize air drag of the aircraft, uh, to enhance efficiency because Air Track each bed offered because it's gonna air more air direct will, uh, increase fuel.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, yeah, so?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh, so there was a local team in Charleston or consisted of like, early, like early trigger people. And there was a like product development team in, like Southern California, so we were supposed to accordion with them. So, the objective was to. To design the like engine, whether it can be just. It's very open, and it can be electrical or pure mechanical, and you just have to place the engine, uh, in like a certain location to maximize it. So it's very like, mostly disciplinary, like a project, and it event to, uh, for the when you hit the team meeting. We actually decide to just make it a pure mechanical, so it ended up actually being like a pure gear design type type.\n\nTeam, and it's very specialized work for, like, a care design, a pure mechanical in general. So, we, for the first couple meetings there was no progress, and we just keep postponing and we will try to like fighting experts slash subject matter expertise as me or, and one day, I was looking through the like the list of the subject layer experts, and I found one guy.\n\nUh, like the mechanical engineer like working in Arizona, and he had like a pay. At Boeing, you can see they were like profile of, like people, always their experience if they updated. And then I reached out to him, and he turned out that years many years of experience, so designing gears in general, uh. So I started a meeting with him, and I had some I, and he explained, and yeah, he transferred some of the like.\n\nA follow-up meeting with him and trying to gain more knowledge. And then, eventually, he provided some, uh, like some template, for which could be useful for our project. And then, uh, when I received when I received the template I shared with the team, and also I was going through a template line by line, uh, it was the Excel template, by the way, line by line. And then I was asked I, I'll call him up, or even like, send him a message. If you find any questions and I even tailored me, tailor it to.\n\nThere, we made a good progress and. Uh, we were able to coordinate with the project development team in Southern California, and we made sure the design and we were fine. We were able to finalize the engine engine like a placemat, uh, in the aircraft, and uh, but I ended up transferring to, uh, like different team like internal transfer to us. I did not get a chance to like continue working on that, uh, but? When I was there, like, we made a significant like, uh, yeah, I mean progress, uh, because of that, like a template, and some of them, I'll transfer, and, uh, what I heard after I left, uh, maybe a couple like, maybe about a year later, was that the project? Like, go very well, and they were actually even thinking about, like having a like contract official contract with NASA.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThat's pretty cool. All right, so. Now, so once you now that you've completed the project, is there anything that you would do differently? What were the key learnings you got from this experience?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI would say, definitely like any, like, major work. It's not something you can do it individually alone. Uh, so I highly, uh. Of value, like a teamwork, or I mean, even more so after that experience, and especially, uh. Also diversity as well because I mean, we nobody had experience with Social Security desires, so and but we found someone like with that experience, so it definitely helped helped us, like along the way. So there was a very crucial and lastly, in terms of, uh, while I do it differently. Maybe I was like trying to more proactively? Maybe going through the list of like a people on the directories and try to find someone sooner instead of just keep like staying in the limbo because we look, we kind of missed it. Like, quite a bit of time. Just yeah, like being on your side. Undecisive. So, yeah,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThat makes sense. Did you learn anything about gear design like from this, or did you mostly rely on this other guy? I'm kind of. I'm kind of curious.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nComplex. It's like going back to college like machine design work for mechanical engineering, like using the textbook. But yeah, sometimes. I mean, if, uh, I, I have a like, I have a belief like, uh, any jobs, especially in big corporate. I feel like, it's, uh, like, even if people without background, uh, can be like taught and learnable, uh, given, like, enough time and training, but for gear design. In my opinion, I mean, that's not something you can really. Like, yeah, be like, learned in like a in like a?\n\nSomething which I am grateful for, but I mean trying to do it from scratch. Yeah, there's no\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWay.\n\nYeah. Did you have to machine it, or were you like? So, it sounds like you actually had to machine the gear specifically for the task, rather than being able to find something that worked off the shelf. Is that right?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nNo everything's, just. So, I mean, everything's kind of like. Especially though I did a structural analysis, uh, yeah, most, I mean, it's just a inferior computer like doing design and analysis pretty much so nothing, uh? And so on, but I mean, I mentioned machine design because that's one of the college courses here, where they actually teach you like a little bit about, like a gear design like, yeah, there's like a bunch of like values, and like, uh, each kind of like reference material as well, like so when you want to design something like it was kind of like a gear. So yeah, there's like all this, like a peace ratio for the gears and all that stuff. Yeah, inside the boat, which is great reference.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCool. I think that makes a lot of sense to me. Um. Awesome! That's so fun. That's a fun, little story. I, uh, I love all the soul side projects you can get done. All right. So let's, let's move on to the next one here. Can you describe a time? When you needed to influence a peer who had a differing opinion on a shared goal.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, I'll use an example for, like, from my uh graduate class for computer science so? I was taking a classical data structures and software design class, and there was a group project at the end with a total group of like two people, uh. So, just so, just me, and like, like, a partner. Also, it was the software design project with, uh, so the data was, uh, like massive covid-19 data, and we were, uh, we were supposed to follow the design specifications uh, such as like antier architecture, and there were some requirements for, like each data.\n\nBy meeting all those specification requirements there, so I just had a more bandwidth. So, because my partner was like working full time and he was taking two classes, which was yeah, which was insane. Yeah, so I jumped on it, and I purchased, like architect and system design, and I went through the details and came up with the uml diagram for the, uh, for the project, and I split up the work, and we like continued working and my.\n\nOver engineer everything. So, yeah, we have some. Yeah, we have some discussion on uml diagram and he wants to get change and I'll reach because I mean, I wanted his inputs as well, so that was totally okay. But there was a strong disagreement on data structure, because in one of the like, a data and data analysis requirement, uh, zip like, there's a data pertains to like zip code or for, like, Kobe, like United data, and this, like, set of data, just doesn't doesn't.\n\nA partner keep insisting that we should use streamlab and, but we don't, because it doesn't have to be sorry. We don't have to stream a hashmap, it's like a faster because stream app for lookup is like log n of time like, yeah, time, complexity, uh. So, what I did was I barked up as? I, I just marked up that we need to revisit later. If there's a if it takes a hit on performance, because like that application. A lot takes like couple minutes to actually get working, and there's a time limit about the project, because if if you exceed the time, or you get zero on the functionality portion, because it's like 30 of the like, overall grade. So, ah, yeah, so? Like a merch, all the files, and uh, able to get it working, and we were able to. I mean, it was, at that point. It was more of optional whether to keep the data structure as is, uh, keep it as treatment or versus, uh, like a hashmat, so, but I. In general. Like, uh, like, every time I have some disagreement, or like, I want to like, convey, like, what I, what, I think, and I want the other party to like, compete, what, I think, and we try to have a healthy discussion. And I mean, it's not really about, like, a like, an ego battle. In my opinion, I just want to, uh, personally speaking, like, oh, I mean, I'm totally fine. Like, if somebody has a better idea, I mean, as long as it's I just, it's just available like, who's, like, right, and better? I mean, that's all I really care about. So, for your assistance, it was just just.\n\nThat I was, like, right, for sure. I'll definitely, uh, yeah, voice. Yeah, I would definitely like, yeah, like, voice up about, uh, my stance, and try to, uh, convince, uh, the other party on that.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nMakes sense.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThen? The so just a I'm just going to summarize a little bit here to make sure I understand. Like you, there was. You built this data structure program to analyze a bunch of data and basically the you were worried that the data structure of the day wanted to use wasn't going to be effective enough or rather efficient enough to complete the analysis of all the data in time because you were using one structure over the other. Yeah, and then in the end it, were you able to run it against the test server? I assume there's a test server to verify that it did, in fact, run in time. It\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWas a pure static, uh, like, I mean, like, nothing like, I mean, it was just like a like, static, like project. So, like,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay, yeah,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nInternet or anything, but the data was, like, humongous, uh. So, I was, my main worry was, it's gonna like, probably serve as a bottleneck for that, like using data structure, but but I didn't really. I could have measured it, uh, but I know Java, like, uh, there's like time, like, excuses. It's not that accurate, but I could have done it. But at that point. I mean, we were just happy with that, because yeah, I mean, we could tell.\n\nVery finicky, so my partner again willing to change, keep changing stuff, and then you start finicky. And then he just later realized that apologized to me, because, yeah, because it just stopped working. So, we had to roll it back to the previous version working version and then just move. Move on.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay, well, it sounds like you were able to like support your teammate, uh? Didn't agree with what he was doing, but it ended up working out because you guys had a, you know, a good working relationship because of it, and so you were able to work through it. Okay, that that makes sense to me, makes it makes a lot of sense. And so then. I'm guessing you guys passed that, uh? That course, for sure.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, I mean, because almost like a perfect score, I mean, we got some points to accept for, like, something like, very minority, but we got almost like close to hundreds.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI like that. All right, um? So? Can you answer one more question for me?\n\nCan you give me an example of a tough or critical piece of feedback that you've received?\n\nLet\n\n[Speaker 1]\nMe see.\n\nI'm not sure if it really falls under critical. I mean, all it's kind of a mixed up critical slash, uh, like disagreement, uh, but I'll go ahead. And yeah, use this example. So this was, uh, this was my second job, like in the Charleston again. Also, the main job was the factory support slash material review board. So, whenever there's like damage, or like down performers like, part like, uh, for the airframe part, uh, I, as an analyst, had to like, review the repair option and?\n\nExisting repair option or come up with, like, better repair option as, like, send it, uh, send a repair package to the shop. Yeah, so there's a there's an area called flight line where, like all the aircraft is already assembled and ready to be like delivered to the aircraft and. The job came from the flight line area and the engineer from there. Like, uh, reached out to me in urgent manner, saying that it's like, there's a damage, and they're like secondary panel like secondary panel, each still serviceable, like without the like, a secondary part, but still, like, oh, I mean, we are selling the brand new aircraft. So, I mean, the parks there had Fair to be, like, yeah, brand new, and like, tfx free, right? So, and so, I had to analyze or like and review the damage, but, uh. But the engineer, like? Call who reached out to me, told me that there's a prior like analysis on similar damage in similar location, and he, he thinks it's like good to go without, like a like, extensive repair. Uh, so I actually got a chance to look at the repair thoroughly, and I compare it to my, uh, my the damage that I'm like, currently like, analyzing, and realized that it's not, uh? Like, although it's similar like a damage and like a similar location, but the damage that I was analyzing was that the like? The most critical like location where, like the I mean, any damage in the location. It's not like feasible to repair, so, uh, when I reach out to the when I, I mean, after I run through analysis, and uh, got back to him, and he was a little bit like, uh, like a little bit like argument tip about that. He, he thought that. A prior repair analysis follows like a very similar to mine, and he said he thought he could get by. So I had to actually had to, uh, I mean, after, um, after exhausting all my all the options from my side. I set up a meeting with my lead and my manager, and then I informed like this situation, and then even, uh, and against the engine from the fly line to yeah, uh, come to this meeting, and I explained my findings and allowances and. Is repairable, so I, and then obviously he was not happy with it, but he had to go with it, but I did. Uh, provide the option so. So, unfortunately, we have to scrap the part, right? But, uh, I suggest I propose the solution that we could actually borrow that part from the one of the aircraft inside the inner, because that part is interchangeable. So, so there's no, uh, delay, or anything like that, we just, uh, yeah, borrowed it from there and then. So basically, uh. Uh, safety and quality is the top priority, because I mean, in the long term, sense, like, imagine that panel gets placed and ends. What if it falls like down the road, then maybe hit somebody? I mean, the company will be liable for like a lawsuit, so I pretty much like mitigate the possibility of like low suit for the company. And yeah, so.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNice so! So, it sounds like you ended up doing the right thing for the company and to make sure that the team was, you know, working together. So, that sounds all good to me.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nCool.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThank you, um. Those are all the questions I have. Do you have the Live code link?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSure. Yep.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAll right. Um.\n\nSorry, I have to sign in.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, I'll refresher when it's ready. Yeah, it says session is currently closed. Just okay,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAre you using Java?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYes,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAll right.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, I'm just going to paste the\n\n[Speaker 2]\nInterview question here.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, I see the question, uh, so print of view of a binary tree is seen from below 583.\n\n22, 25.\n\n5, 10, 3, 12, so are we just skipping? Note 20 and like node eight?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo? If you can picture this, you're you're viewing the tree from below and looking straight up, right? So? Um, if I am in? This position. Oh,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThat's not the pipe\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThis position right here, right where I put that pipe? If you look straight up, you can see the 10. And the 10 is actually blocking your view of the eight, right? Yep, and so that's why you are. It's not that you're skipping the eight. It's that you cannot see the eight from your vantage point, right? Okay.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhat about 20? Is it? Is that the same as like a three blocking 20 correct? Okay. Oh, this is interesting. Question, yeah, let me think a little bit.\n\nYeah, I'm just, uh, like labeling the nodes like this index. So, yeah, see if I can, like, here, find some like a hint search pattern.\n\nFive.\n\nOkay, I think, uh. I guess the reason why the output is like, that is, because for if there's like. So, for instance, for eight, if there's a?\n\nIf there's a node on the right? I mean, if you have children like or right children and right, children has like left children then.\n\nYou omit this one. I guess for the rude as well. So if there's a children and then?\n\nLeft children, and then there's. Left Right into this right left, okay? Left, right, right left?\n\nSo, what's\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThe approach you're thinking about taking? Just help me understand where you're at. Yeah,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nJust so, maybe run through, like, uh, just like maybe one of the like, the graph traversal algorithm, and then, uh, so if it has?\n\nIf it has like a like, one of their children, for instance. If so, this one has like a so eight has right children, and this children has, uh, eight children on the other side. Then, you omit this, uh.\n\nThis one so? For 20, let's say, even like, let's say, if, like, uh, the branch of like three and ten doesn't exist. But for, let's say, like a 2020, like a, uh? Like, like, children on each left. So, basically, this one has. 20th, right, children. And there's opposite, uh, there's the children in the opposite direction, which is left. So then we apply 20, but I mean, am I missing something, uh, in terms of like solving it or? Well, I think that\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThe you can solve this really with any either either of the graph traversals, right?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay it,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIt really is, you know, you can do whatever. Um. I think the important piece to keep track of right is, how do you? Keep track of if something else? Is lower in the tree and in the same. Like position. Vertically, right?\n\nSo, what I mean by that is like? If I, if I pretended, for example, that, uh, this position here was zero. And this position is one, and this position is two. How do I? All I really want to know, is, is something else? What is the lowest thing in position one? Right?\n\nSame thing is true for, like? Minus one, right?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nBut which would be three, and then this would be, you know, minus two. The the alignment's not working out very well, but you understand what I'm saying. Um. I think that might be an easier way for you to think about. How do you maintain State as you Traverse the tree?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI guess, like I, I guess, so we can do like? Keep trackable levels, right?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYou could keep track of levels. Yeah,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYour level so?\n\nI think if it has, yeah, I think my challenge is that, how should I like, uh, output, like, in such a way that, like, it starts from 5, 10, 3, 20 to 25, so I mean, initially, I don't think there's an inner Trevor traversal pre-order and post, like, called post order, but? Has to be in order. Doesn't seem like.\n\nBecause in order, you'll be like five eight.\n\n822.\n\nZero negative one?\n\nUh, at least our International. I'll just set up to like skeleton code.\n\nIs there any like specific property of the tree that I need to come for, or um? I don't.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI don't really think so. I think that what you so a good approach that you might be able to take right is? Keeping when you're doing, or which, which traversal? Or do you plan on using?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nMaybe in order to travel travel for like ptfs because I mean the order matters, right, right? So?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIt's, it's really the the things that matter, right, are the level each note is at and the vertical distance? From the root of each. Uh, or horizontal distance from the root of each. Node so that you can figure out whatever the lowest level one is at that horizontal distance is the one that you want to print, right?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSorry, could you repeat it one more time? Yeah,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo if we're looking at the example above, right?\n\nWhen we, when we Traverse the entire graph and process every node, we're going to have two different values that would be at negative two. Right. That would be eight and ten. Correct?\n\nYep, okay. So, since we have both 8 and 10 in the negative two, uh, distance from the root? We then need to process which one is on a lower level.\n\nAnd so, by processing which one is on a lower level, you just need to keep track of the depth. Um. Of the node in the tree. Right,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhy would it be so that? Why would it like eight and ten be like a negative two? Uh, because it's the distance from the root, right? Oh, sorry,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIt would be it would be negative one, sorry.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI was,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI was, uh, I was misspeaking there, but yes, they would both be in the negative one slot. Um, and so you just need to apply eight,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUh, I mean. So, the distance from eight to I mean from the root to eight is negative one and then distance from the like. A root to 10 is would be two right negative two, I guess.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo, if you, if I look at this? Um. There are. There are a couple values in the way there. There's the. There's the. There's the three, and then there's the ten, right? So, this is at root position zero, right?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYep,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThe eight we move one to the left, so we'll call it minus one. Okay, the three. Is? These, the three moves back to the right. So, it is at root position zero.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, because it's negative one, plus one, right, yes. And then,\n\n[Speaker 2]\n10 moves back to the left. So, it's at root position, negative one.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo now I can see. V like, if I look at position? What I see is I'm gonna have. And I'm gonna have ten. If I look at position? I'm gonna have two values, right? I'm gonna have eight, and I'm gonna have three. Correct? Yep, and so now. Basically, if I look at both of these values. The determining factor for which one to print? Is just going to be. Come on!\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSorry, I did this wrong. It says 20\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAnd 3, and this is 8 and 10, yeah, so 20 and 3 are at position zero. Right?\n\nAnd so I need to pick which one is lower, which is three. And then I do the same thing for this one. So eight and ten are both at position negative one, not one negative one. And the 10 will win because it is a lower than eight.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nDoes that make sense? For negative value, I guess so, the?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThe reason? That this one works right is eight and ten are both in. If you look at the horizontal distance from the root, right? So, like, side to side? They're, they're both in position negative one away from the root. Like, if you picture drawing a wine straight down from 20, you're gonna hit 20 and three. So, if I go one to the left and I draw a straight line, I'm going to hit 8 and I'm going to hit 10. So they're at position negative one. So what I really since I what I want to do is print the view from below? What I need to do is understand. Which of those nodes is the lowest so that I'll actually be seeing it? All right, because the. In this example is covering the eight, so you won't see it.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, it's the lowest right.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThe lowest one wins. Yeah.\n\nDoes that make more sense?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, okay.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAnd I\n\n[Speaker 1]\nGuess for five, yeah, let me just finish. Yeah, I guess here, probably, and for five would be negative two.\n\n22b1. 25 bit 2, so if over to fill up this?\n\nBring it 2.\n\nNavigate to five.\n\n22, so 22. Two equals. 0.5.\n\n0.5.\n\nFive, ten, three, okay, wow.\n\nSo I. Yeah, get the distance.\n\nAnd then, maybe there's got to be helpful help for helper function. Yeah, so. And let me.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThere. There's not really a helper function that gives you depth of a node. Um. For trees, but I think you can just. Um. You know you. You can basically keep track of that yourself. Based off of how you're doing your traversal, right?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, I'm just like DFS, and then, uh, like so, uh? If it's left, you do like, and then I would probably put it in the like, uh out, can I have a global variable like a hashmere where I can keep like a try? Yeah, sure.\n\nUm. What I can do for\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYou here is. I can give you the. Um. This is the definition. Of a node.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, so.\n\nOops!\n\nIf it's true.\n\nWell, this has to be. Integer, because we. We have to calculate.\n\nSo, if node equals no, and we'll return.\n\nResolved, initially decided to zero.\n\nI would add like another argument argument called value so we can keep track of the. Value as? For each recursive call, and then you can either increment or decrement. So, when node equals null, it's.\n\nIt will return value. To initially decide, so I have to change this to. Uh.\n\nSo,\n\n[Speaker 3]\nPerson equals DFS\n\n[Speaker 1]\nLoad stuff left.\n\nOkay, so because we start from the airport with each each, the distance from? Or to like a root to root of zero, so initially set it at zero, and then you run the left. And. Take from at. Then Pastor heshmer. And then you when you go to write. Increment. By one, then hashmap and.\n\nI think this should calculate.\n\nHorizontal distance. I just have to. Figure out. How to?\n\nTo put it into the hashmer.\n\nJohn left, and then you trimmer by one. And then are you Trappers right, and you increment by one?\n\nYou don't really need to return at this point, so I'll get rid of this. Then, when you hit. You just return. Facetus.\n\nGet the distance, get the horizontal map, and then. Does this. So, since you're doing a DFS?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nHow do you make sure you're not overriding a value in map.put? With something that's a higher level than it right, because you might go really deep on one side. And then. If you later process something else that was. You know above it, but your DFS hit it later. Then, how did you make sure that it didn't override the value?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nDoes that\n\n[Speaker 2]\nMake sense? Okay.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI have to. I have to like, keep kind of like a visit like visited node, right?\n\nNodes visit.\n\nYeah, I'm gonna use hash set to keep track of the note, whether it's visited or not. So if?\n\nVisit that add. Note that we put.\n\nDid you already visited so then? It's not. It's just going to return.\n\nSo?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThe it's not necessarily about visiting a node again, right? It's about visiting. A vertical location. So, in in the example that you have? Um. What if I? Added in something like this. Let's see if I can make this work. Um. If I add in a 5 and then like a seven? And then I add in. Back here. Um. Of. And or well, another number that hasn't been used yet, and then another one like here. Um, that does, let's say, nine right. So technically, this nine would be covering the 10, but you would process it first.\n\nRight, and so what ended up happening is the nine should be the return value, but the return value is actually going to be 10.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nKind, I mean.\n\nI'm just. Like relatives in the root first.\n\nSo, this is my Approach. I mean, I was tuning this, I mean. This helper function just calculate the oversized distance from the room and then just put it in the map, right? And then I would. Get this. How to extract the values of the map, so it will be like the distance horizontal distance to the\n\n[Speaker 3]\nFrom? To the root, right, and then?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm, if there's a more than like, uh, like, yeah, more than one value, then I will like, decide like, which one to go for, like the first? Is like distance? And.\n\nBut I think, uh, maybe this my approach for calculating the distance is now, right, right?\n\nYes.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm. I actually think I think you're on the right track here, but unfortunately, we are just about out of time. Uh, okay, yeah. So, um, I'm gonna just copy this over. Um, and the last little bit of the interview is just for you to ask me any questions that you might have.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, sure. So, I watched the culture, like, at Amazon.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, culture very much depends. Uh, team to team. It is a you know, like, so there's a very you know. We have this concept of two Pizza teams where teams should be small enough that you can feed the entire team with two large pizzas, right? But what that means is that each team effectively becomes. Um, it's a little microcosm of like culture and how it works there. There is some general overarching Amazon culture, but? A lot of your experience at Amazon is determined by the actual team. That you are working with.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nIs literally like a work is really. It really varies from, like, what team you are like, you are in. Oh, there's many teams and I was all right. Yeah,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThere's. There's a very wide variety of what you could be working on and what your daily work will look like, depending on the team that you're on. Even possibly tell you. What it would look like?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, by the way, so? For someone, or like, who doesn't have any experience, or like, uh, what kind of advice do you have for someone, like, I mean, I obviously got exposure to like large database when I was working in one of the projects like working on, like, uh uh, the like, a network system project, uh, but maybe it's not even at on the like, same scale like, uh, like industrial, like, uh, code things. So, for someone like a new, uh, to the industry, like, what kind of advice do you have for people like me, like?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNow, it doesn't really. Matter. What you, and in my opinion, most entry-level roles. It doesn't really matter what it is that you have experience in what matters the most is the. The foundational pieces like, you know, you know how to code, you generally know how data structures work. You generally have an idea of like how apis work yada yada. The details of like the databases that are used and like? Different types of calls, a bunch of other stuff. It really is stuff that you can learn on the job, and as long as you can show that you're good at learning. Um, then? That's, that's pretty much the most important piece.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAnd. Why Amazon? So, what's your like, favorite part of Amazon, like working for Amazon? I'm not sure, like, Elise, uh, like, favorite part of like working Amazon, um,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSometimes there's a little more bureaucracy than I like in order to get things done. Um, it's probably pretty moment main con, the the good thing is, is that you can influence change anywhere in the company. If you do your due diligence and show data, um, so that's always a nice thing.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nKnow what kind of like formal training. So, like, yeah, do you guys have? Is it more like, most, like, like, a like, mostly like, uh, people around the job by doing it, or do you guys actually offer? Like, formal training. I mean, I guess I come from Aerospace background, right? So, yeah, like, we have like that structured, like training courses, but I'm not sure about, like, how it works like a basically software, uh, development world?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYou can take formal trainings. I don't think I ever have, so it is definitely entirely up to you how you want to go about learning. Um, so all right, I have to go to my next interview, but talk to you later, bye.\n\nHello!\n\n[Speaker 3]\nHello!","numLines":500,"startLine":1,"totalLines":500}}}

Let's go ahead and get to it. So the way this is gonna go? Uh, yeah, we'll do some introductions and then. I'm going to ask you a few questions about yourself just to get some understanding of your background, and then we're going to go into a coding question. I like to save the, you know, the Lion's Share of the interview for the coding portion? To make sure you have enough time to show off your skills. Um, and then I'll save five minutes from the end of the hour, uh, just for us to, um, just so you can ask me any questions you might have about what it's like to work\n    21→\n    22→[Speaker 3]\n    23→At Amazon. Um,\n    24→\n    25→[Speaker 2]\n    26→So just.\n    27→\n    28→[Speaker 1]\n    29→Keep that in mind when you're going through the coding part, um. The the time.\n    30→\n    31→[Speaker 2]\n    32→Cool.\n    33→\n    34→[Speaker 1]\n    35→All right, so introductions tell me a little about yourself. I'm sure I\n    36→\n    37→[Speaker 2]\n    38→Am a software developer currently working for Tulsa City County libraries, and uh, my main responsibilities would be working on web applications and mobile applications, um, there are usually like three types that the library maintains. The first one being the customer facing application. Um, and this includes, like both iPhone and Android mobile apps, and the second type would be web applications could just internal staff where they can. Where they can moderate the content of the mobile applications and store all the information and data. And the third type would be like the main website Library website, which is. Managed by Drupal or content management system. So, I got a good opportunity to work on all of these different kinds of applications. Other than this, I got an opportunity to work with two startups startup companies back in Arizona when I was studying at Arizona State University. Um, I was also. Tutoring for undergraduate students back in my University? And other than my work and outside of my work responsibilities and hobbies, I usually try to build some personal projects. Uh, this way I can try new text tag. So, um? Yeah, I am really excited about the. Uh, Amazon's opportunity because\n    39→\n    40→[Speaker 4]\n    41→It really closely aligns with my interests and values.\n    42→\n    43→[Speaker 1]\n    44→Cool!\n    45→\n    46→[Speaker 3]\n    47→All\n    48→\n    49→[Speaker 1]\n    50→Right. A little bit about me, uh? I'm a software developer at Amazon. I've been here for about. Huh, eight years? Um, and I've worked in a variety of different places. I started my career as an intern. And then went and got hired full time after college. I've worked in a large number of different places. I started in Alexa doing voice communication. I moved over to Prime air with the Drone delivery. Side of the company, and I built a lot of the on the ground maintenance software. From there, I moved into asbx, which stands for Amazon software Builder experience. Um, where I worked on the operator tooling piece. So, basically, how do developers interact with their? Production environments in order to perform operations when things go wrong and so forth. Um, and now I am on, uh, we call the golden path team.\n    51→\n    52→[Speaker 2]\n    53→We\n    54→\n    55→[Speaker 1]\n    56→Kind of come up with recommendations for how you should be running your services. Um, to make sure that you are doing what's best for your customers, as well as identifying gaps where we think that things could be better than working with teams to own the solutions or building the solutions our self. If there is no real good owner?\n    57→\n    58→[Speaker 2]\n    59→So,\n    60→\n    61→[Speaker 1]\n    62→Yeah. All right, um? Let's just jump right on in. Uh, can you tell me about a time, uh, when you realize you needed a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job?\n    63→\n    64→[Speaker 2]\n    65→Um, I would say, um. When I initially started with Tulsa libraries, I did not have much of PHP background. All I had was a conceptual. Theoretical practice, but I never had, like, Hands-On practice for that. So initially, I was not tasked with any back-end related tasks. They were all front-end. Already familiar with. So, after that, during that time, I saw that most of the applications there had were very heavily based on PHP. So, I thought that it would be really nice to start or get a head start for the PHP back-end or PHP language in generals because there was a lot happening. All the API calls all the database calls. All of these were happening in PHP, even for the mobile applications so. Good idea to actually dive deep before I am given the actual back in class. So this is when I started reading company documentation, and then I started reading the code base. Writing down all the flows. Like, I remember making flow charts, and uh, Maps. See how the behind the scenes is actually working. So, this was when it was in the beginning stage where I had to like dive deep into the backing portion of the company.\n    66→\n    67→[Speaker 1]\n    68→Cool! Um.\n    69→\n    70→Sorry.\n    71→\n    72→So? Can you tell me more about like what? Which are like the key learnings you got from this experience were?\n    73→\n    74→[Speaker 2]\n    75→Key warnings warnings. Learnings. Yeah. Yeah, sure, um. Like, um? The first thing was when I, uh, started looking at the database. First thing was, I panicked because. All I knew was the basic language like basic syntax and the things that were happening were very, uh, deep. So, first, I was panicking, and then I just calmed myself down, and I told myself that starting with a basics again, I crushed up my Basics, and then I looked into a lot of online tutorials. And this was all during the training period, so? My first lesson was to not panic immediately. I don't understand anything. Because there are lots of documentations. There are lots of tutorials, and with this, my manager also was very friendly. They were my whole team was very open for to me for the entire period of training, so that helped me to calm down a little bit. And then I started like, uh, absorbing all the\n    76→\n    77→[Speaker 4]\n    78→All the PHP stuff.\n    79→\n    80→[Speaker 2]\n    81→And the second thing would be asking the seniors because when I did not understand something I had this, I had this habit of doing it myself or sitting for long time periods and trying to figure out myself in my head. I'm, I don't want to bother my seniors with the questions that I could have solved myself. And then, when I started asking seniors, I got to know that they're really open to like helping Juniors because.\n    82→\n    83→[Speaker 4]\n    84→They are more experienced. They can easily understand what is working well, so the\n    85→\n    86→[Speaker 2]\n    87→Most important lesson I learned was to ask senior when when it's very hard for you to figure out something so that I don't waste time in the process.\n    88→\n    89→[Speaker 1]\n    90→Where did you? How did you learn how to draw the line between? Something you should go figure out and learn on your own versus something that would be more effective just by asking a senior.\n    91→\n    92→[Speaker 2]\n    93→Um, the first, uh, paint that I would get was, if there are, if there is something similar online, like if someone has a similar similar problem, and they have solved it, even though I don't understand the solution.\n    94→\n    95→[Speaker 4]\n    96→I can actually. Go through that couple of times to understand\n    97→\n    98→[Speaker 2]\n    99→What's happening. The problem comes when there is no proven solution out there for me to learn from. So, if I'm if I'm wasting days or probably weeks, just on one problem, then that's when it's like a red red flag or a red red alert that I have to ask my senior. Like minimum or maximum of like two days. It should be good that I can solve it myself.\n   100→\n   101→[Speaker 1]\n   102→Okay. Um. So, if I recall, you were talking about having to learn how your database works, right? Um. Yes, what kind of database was it?\n   103→\n   104→[Speaker 2]\n   105→I lose my sequel, okay?\n   106→\n   107→[Speaker 1]\n   108→And I'm guessing you just didn't have exposure to my sequel before.\n   109→\n   110→[Speaker 2]\n   111→Oh no, I had exposure to my sequel before, but I did not have, uh, how the database connections are made with PHP, and it was completely different. Syntax PHD had like a whole different syntax than usual. Did they\n   112→\n   113→[Speaker 1]\n   114→Use, like, uh orm, or was it just like raw SQL query kind of deal?\n   115→\n   116→[Speaker 2]\n   117→Um, it, it was raw SQL queries most of the time. Yes, okay.\n   118→\n   119→[Speaker 1]\n   120→Interesting. Um.\n   121→\n   122→Did you? Were you familiar with PHP as well going in?\n   123→\n   124→[Speaker 2]\n   125→Uh, I'm sorry. What was that?\n   126→\n   127→[Speaker 1]\n   128→Were you familiar with PHP as well? Uh, going into this.\n   129→\n   130→[Speaker 2]\n   131→Uh, not, not much because I did not have a PHP backing mostly was, like, JavaScript, so I was pretty familiar with JavaScript. I have, uh, I did my basic syntax, or like going through, like basic tutorials before, um, joining the company. So I had like basic syntax, but I never had, like, practical experience. I've never written down like programs and methods in PHP before.\n   132→\n   133→[Speaker 1]\n   134→That makes sense. How long Emilio does it? Uh, how did you go about learning PHP? I'm curious. I've never had to do it myself.\n   135→\n   136→[Speaker 2]\n   137→Um, yeah, it's just like starting out with writing, uh, small functions or methods, myself, or like replicating what is in the code base already? And if I don't understand like a keyword or any word that is or any type or function that is used, then I would just, uh, search it online and I'll get like the. Description or the tutorial, then go from it. Yeah, since? It was, like, very in a flow, you know,\n   138→\n   139→[Speaker 4]\n   140→Sequential flow. It was easier for me.\n   141→\n   142→[Speaker 1]\n   143→Um,\n   144→\n   145→[Speaker 2]\n   146→I could get an idea of where to start learning, so that helped a lot. What was the\n   147→\n   148→[Speaker 1]\n   149→What's the hardest part about learning PHP?\n   150→\n   151→[Speaker 2]\n   152→I would say the syntax for sure. It was super confusing in the beginning, like right. When I looked at it, there were a lot of, uh, different things going on. It's not as straightforward as JavaScript. And they were like dollar signs, uh, they were different, uh, symbols, and and that, like, really overwhelmed. So, I think getting the first? Squish towards learning towards that was hard okay, but\n   153→\n   154→[Speaker 1]\n   155→Once\n   156→\n   157→[Speaker 2]\n   158→I got used to it, I was okay, so I\n   159→\n   160→[Speaker 1]\n   161→Have no idea how PHP works like, literally at all. So what, what are these like random symbols, like if you could tell me what some of the random symbols of what they do. That'd be cool. Oh yeah,\n   162→\n   163→[Speaker 2]\n   164→Um, so some of them are used for like variables. You can, like, inject the variables into the functions. So, uh, let's say, for?\n   165→\n   166→Like for print statements for database connections or any variables that were there, and I've never seen that syntax before, so\n   167→\n   168→[Speaker 1]\n   169→That is weird. Okay. All right, any any other ones or any other like weird PHP isms? And you thought were fun, um? You can say, no, it's fine.\n   170→\n   171→[Speaker 2]\n   172→Yeah, no, yeah, I think the whole, uh, syntax itself, is like different. So, it was like a very new experience. Learning it.\n   173→\n   174→[Speaker 1]\n   175→Um, yeah. That makes sense. Okay, cool. I think I got enough. I don't need to talk about PHP anymore. I've heard enough horror stories about it's the existence, so. Um. Cool. Okay, so? Can you tell me about a time? Um, when you needed to influence a peer who had a differing opinion about a shared goal.\n   176→\n   177→[Speaker 2]\n   178→Um, yes, I, um. So, I was thinking I had a couple of instances here. Um. So, if I get the question, right? So, having like a different opinion on something similar?\n   179→\n   180→Correct, yeah.\n   181→\n   182→[Speaker 1]\n   183→So, so an example would be like? I need to create a database for my service. I want to use SQL and they want to use nosql. Like, how did you guys, right, um?\n   184→\n   185→[Speaker 2]\n   186→How did you guys\n   187→\n   188→[Speaker 1]\n   189→Come to an agreement on what the end result was going to be?\n   190→\n   191→[Speaker 2]\n   192→Um, yeah, I would say it was in terms of one, uh, technology, that we wanted to use. Actually, it was, uh, gitlab. So, um. Um, what happened was right now. Currently, the company doesn't have, like, an integrated tool where all the developers communicate in the same platform. Um, it's like a normal kit basic repository, uh, where we just like commit our changes. So, um. What happened is the team had a couple of, uh, meetings with the kid lab team, and they were pitching the idea that we need to integrate, uh, the gitlab into? Our development. Team. So, uh, the entire team, along with our manager, they would not really. They're not really into that idea, and my manager told that they would probably like try it some other time, and they were not looking for any integration, uh tool, but since I had like experience with gitlab before, um? He told them that this would be a really good tool to integrate with our system, so that's when. We, my manager, set up a separate meeting just for the developers, and they asked me to, like, present, uh, what my ideas were, and why I got that. So that's when I had to like, um. That my opinion of why I am introducing this one, the the gitlab, to um, the current system, and they were asking, like, why, I thought it was good. Um, and yeah, uh, that was like a different opinion from the entire team.\n   193→\n   194→[Speaker 1]\n   195→So? You wanted you. You have experience with gitlab and you wanted to integrate gitlab and your team didn't really want to integrate gitlab and so you had it. So I'm just curious, what was your team using? For Source control before, like, you used git, but you just didn't have a central repo.\n   196→\n   197→[Speaker 2]\n   198→Yeah, so we had a central Loop built on the gift view, but it was not something like GitHub, where? Um, so, it was just like a basic, uh, staff internal staff application, which just had, like, the repository a basic view of what the repositories were. So it was like super basic, but so it was something sorry. Go ahead.\n   199→\n   200→[Speaker 1]\n   201→How did you share code?\n   202→\n   203→[Speaker 2]\n   204→Um, share code.\n   205→\n   206→[Speaker 1]\n   207→Like, if I, so the way, the way I understand, I just want to make sure I understand kind of the setup you guys have. Like, I have GitHub. Right where I I push code to it, and then my teammate can pull code from the same place, and so, like, there's this, the the master up in the cloud, and then we both have our own internal repos that mirror it. So it sounds like you didn't have that Central thing, and you just had GitHub. You're just like git repositories locally, and that was it. Is\n   208→\n   209→[Speaker 2]\n   210→Not as? Good ass GitHub, but it is like a central, uh, platform. Oh,\n   211→\n   212→[Speaker 1]\n   213→Okay, but it only\n   214→\n   215→[Speaker 2]\n   216→Has like repositories and the max we can do is just like clone the repositories and push the code. That's all we can do.\n   217→\n   218→[Speaker 1]\n   219→Okay,\n   220→\n   221→[Speaker 2]\n   222→We can't do like code reviews, or we can do pull requests. Oh.\n   223→\n   224→[Speaker 1]\n   225→Yeah, you had to get server, but it was not. It wasn't a function. It wasn't hadn't have all the bells and whistles of code reviews like commit hooks, so you could do deployments all that kind of stuff. Okay,\n   226→\n   227→[Speaker 2]\n   228→So we only had like our own repositories, and we used to push to this Central repository, and then that's it. We couldn't do anything extra, um, and that was like a pretty basic application that was built way before I was in the company, so I was suggesting that we.\n   229→\n   230→Robust tool where we can do all the code reviews pull requests. We can also integrate or know who is working on what task\n   231→\n   232→[Speaker 1]\n   233→And the\n   234→\n   235→[Speaker 2]\n   236→Communication. Like, I know gitlab does like gyra, uh, integration as well, so I felt like it's gonna be an all-in-one vacation. That was the main reason why I was pushing for it.\n   237→\n   238→[Speaker 1]\n   239→That makes sense. Okay. Um. So? You basically had to go give them the presentation about gitlab so. Before, before I ask about that, were you successful? And getting them to start using gitlab.\n   240→\n   241→[Speaker 2]\n   242→Um, I would say, um, I was successful for them to, like, postpone the. The using of that because it was a really hectic time for the library because it was a summer reading program time, so they were super busy, so my instead of like for a strict, no, I think I was able to make them for. Yes, people at least use like a free tier, or like basic Services. So I got them to that point. So,\n   243→\n   244→[Speaker 1]\n   245→Yeah, it's not a no, it's a yes, when we have time, we'll look at it. Yes, okay, all\n   246→\n   247→[Speaker 2]\n   248→Right. So, with\n   249→\n   250→[Speaker 1]\n   251→The outcome in mind, like, like?\n   252→\n   253→That, you know, this was the right thing for the company.\n   254→\n   255→[Speaker 2]\n   256→Yeah, um. So, the first thing I told them about where I used to get lab, so that was for my internship and for my internship. Also, it was the same company size. They were a startup company, but still, uh, I was letting them know how, like, the communication between the team members was very.\n   257→\n   258→[Speaker 1]\n   259→To.\n   260→\n   261→[Speaker 2]\n   262→Tool, and I gave them some examples and also. Um, I told them why it feels better because what happened was? When, when we were doing a certain task for summer reading program, so there was a slight miscommunication, and I wouldn't say like miscommunication, but it was an assumption made that my team member was doing a task, and they thought that I was doing the task so. Year. We were like maintaining different applications for different. Roles. It was very hard to like, keep track of what exactly we are doing at a certain point. So I mentioned this example to them. And that's when, uh, my teammate also agreed to it, saying that, yes, this did happen. It would be better to have, like, an all-in-one application.\n   263→\n   264→[Speaker 1]\n   265→Okay, so I'm assuming this was a very a fairly recent story considering? It's probably summer right now.\n   266→\n   267→[Speaker 2]\n   268→Yeah, yeah, it was. It was, like, in the beginning of the development phase, yeah.\n   269→\n   270→[Speaker 1]\n   271→Okay,\n   272→\n   273→[Speaker 2]\n   274→It was around like April.\n   275→\n   276→[Speaker 1]\n   277→Okay, so then have they come back to it to start using it yet? Or is that still on the to-do list?\n   278→\n   279→[Speaker 2]\n   280→Not yet. The sum reading program has just ended, so I was thinking of like bringing that to their attention. Um, we also have like a meeting with the kids lab team itself in the future. Um, because we post, we had to postpone their meeting as well, just for the sum reading program. Alignment. Putting that idea back on the table again?\n   281→\n   282→[Speaker 1]\n   283→Nice. Okay, that makes sense. Cool, all right. Well. Um. Don't have any more questions about that? Um, we can go ahead and jump into the coding section.\n   284→\n   285→[Speaker 2]\n   286→Let me.\n   287→\n   288→Go ahead and open\n   289→\n   290→[Speaker 1]\n   291→That up for you.\n   292→\n   293→I just gotta go fill. All this out, give me a minute.\n   294→\n   295→[Speaker 2]\n   296→Um.\n   297→\n   298→Oh my\n   299→\n   300→[Speaker 1]\n   301→Lord. Sorry, the my computer is complaining. Um, all right, so I went ahead and opened the session. Um. And you're going to be using, um? Python.\n   302→\n   303→[Speaker 2]\n   304→Yes, okay.\n   305→\n   306→[Speaker 1]\n   307→Which question to ask? To do.\n   308→\n   309→So? Oh, what is the? Is it triple?\n   310→\n   311→I forget. I think this is how you do block quotes in Python, right? Um.\n   312→\n   313→[Speaker 2]\n   314→Yeah, we can use the normal flashing star.\n   315→\n   316→[Speaker 1]\n   317→It's triple. Yeah.\n   318→\n   319→Oh my Lord. You have to excuse me, I it is. It is a struggle over here. All right. So? This is the question.\n   320→\n   321→Go ahead and! Let me now here. Let me give you a additional.\n   322→\n   323→Um, prompt as well.\n   324→\n   325→[Speaker 2]\n   326→I'll print the view of a binary tree as seen down below, um.\n   327→\n   328→Or two needs fucking.\n   329→\n   330→All right.\n   331→\n   332→A binary tree is given and. We have to print.\n   333→\n   334→The view, oh the view, when you see it from below.\n   335→\n   336→Scene from below.\n   337→\n   338→1493.\n   339→\n   340→So I, my understanding, is that?\n   341→\n   342→So, assuming that we're looking at the binary from?\n   343→\n   344→Um.\n   345→\n   346→And only those elements. Is that correct?\n   347→\n   348→[Speaker 1]\n   349→See, say that one more time. Um, so?\n   350→\n   351→[Speaker 2]\n   352→From what I see from the input and the output is, um. Sending a view of a binary tree from seen from below. That means, like, whatever we see, assuming that we are standing. Beneath it, and we're looking towards the binary. That'll be what we need to print it out. Yes.\n   353→\n   354→[Speaker 1]\n   355→Um, so basically imagine you're standing underneath of the tree looking directly up, right?\n   356→\n   357→[Speaker 2]\n   358→Okay, got it.\n   359→\n   360→Okay, um?\n   361→\n   362→All right.\n   363→\n   364→I'm just wondering.\n   365→\n   366→Yeah,\n   367→\n   368→[Speaker 1]\n   369→I mean, Phil, just ask me questions to understand the problem, um? Please.\n   370→\n   371→[Speaker 2]\n   372→Yeah, uh, yeah, I was just wondering why the? Was not shown because? If I look from the tree about like four as shown, but? Five is not, uh,\n   373→\n   374→[Speaker 1]\n   375→So if you think about it. The which number is being shown instead of the five?\n   376→\n   377→[Speaker 2]\n   378→The nine. So,\n   379→\n   380→[Speaker 1]\n   381→Why would the nine? I so the answer is five and nine are at the same level. And at the same depth. It could be either one. You can pick whichever one you want if there. If there's a if there's a, you know over, if they're Mashed, you can do whichever one you want. Oh.\n   382→\n   383→[Speaker 2]\n   384→Oh, okay, got it. I've yeah, I just. The level portion fit my bad.\n   385→\n   386→[Speaker 1]\n   387→Yeah,\n   388→\n   389→[Speaker 2]\n   390→Thank you for that. The.\n   391→\n   392→[Speaker 1]\n   393→It's, it gets a little bit weird because the I tried to make this so that you can tell the nine. Yeah,\n   394→\n   395→[Speaker 2]\n   396→Yeah, sorry, sorry, yeah, I couldn't. I actually like focused on like the. Representation of it? That's good. Thank you for that, um. Is it okay if I just like? Actually, that I can't just keep it sorry. Okay, so? Yeah, go ahead\n   397→\n   398→[Speaker 1]\n   399→Because I, I can give you the stuff to get started here.\n   400→\n   401→[Speaker 2]\n   402→Okay, thank you.\n   403→\n   404→[Speaker 1]\n   405→Do you have any other questions about um? Why we, how it's working?\n   406→\n   407→[Speaker 2]\n   408→No, that should be it all right?\n   409→\n   410→Great! So.\n   411→\n   412→Since this would be? All. Problems. So, what I mean by that is?\n   413→\n   414→So, um? Usually visualizing it. If I stand underneath this, I should be able to see all the children. Off the tree. And if there are no children or a particular node, then I should be able to see the node itself. That's my first thought for that.\n   415→\n   416→So, for this, I can, um, the way I can. Which node has children or not? Um. I have.\n   417→\n   418→Scrubbers all the way down. To. Most bottom level.\n   419→\n   420→And if a certain node doesn't have?\n   421→\n   422→The children in that level. And I added also to.\n   423→\n   424→I can express each one. And the base case would be. Not having anything of a child so?\n   425→\n   426→Oh, I'm only so.\n   427→\n   428→Type levels it?\n   429→\n   430→So, what do\n   431→\n   432→[Speaker 1]\n   433→You like walk me through your thought process? What are you getting held up on?\n   434→\n   435→[Speaker 2]\n   436→Um, I was trying to see, um. So I know? That. My child notes, like, at whatever are at the least, uh.\n   437→\n   438→[Speaker 1]\n   439→Level,\n   440→\n   441→[Speaker 2]\n   442→They would be seen, or they would be added to the output.\n   443→\n   444→[Speaker 1]\n   445→But\n   446→\n   447→[Speaker 2]\n   448→The notes that do not have child notes. Will also be added to the output because I can see it directly. Does that make sense? So I,\n   449→\n   450→[Speaker 1]\n   451→I don't think it necessarily. You could probably process the entire graph. Regardless of whether or not it has children because, like, a node could have children and still be seen, right?\n   452→\n   453→[Speaker 2]\n   454→Right, like the three here.\n   455→\n   456→[Speaker 1]\n   457→Right, or if, if one, if the tree is incredibly lopsided, right? It. Could the entire right side of the root could be completely unseen because the left was so wide? Right, so I don't think it necessarily matters that you keep track of. If it has children, it almost sounds like you should just process the tree. And then process children. You know if it happens to have children don't don't over index on the children aspect of it?\n   458→\n   459→[Speaker 2]\n   460→Yep, so then that way I would be.\n   461→\n   462→So, if I am? So I should be using, like?\n   463→\n   464→Or centered way.\n   465→\n   466→Fucking.\n   467→\n   468→Oh, okay, I think.\n   469→\n   470→So basically for each sense. It's a binary tree for each level. Like? Possible or the maximum children can have? Um. 2. ^ that level. So? I can see, so my thought process right now is. I can see the. Portion of that particular level.\n   471→\n   472→Well, that helped me, um.\n   473→\n   474→I think that would be so. Let's,\n   475→\n   476→[Speaker 1]\n   477→Let's take a step back and explain to me, yeah.\n   478→\n   479→[Speaker 2]\n   480→How\n   481→\n   482→[Speaker 1]\n   483→You? How do you plan on traversing the tree?\n   484→\n   485→[Speaker 2]\n   486→Um.\n   487→\n   488→So, I was planning to go. Um. Starting from the center node. Um, all the way to?\n   489→\n   490→And then to the right.\n   491→\n   492→[Speaker 1]\n   493→So, so it's like\n   494→\n   495→[Speaker 2]\n   496→In order,\n   497→\n   498→[Speaker 1]\n   499→So that first, okay,\n   500→\n   501→[Speaker 2]\n   502→Yes, yes, okay?\n   503→\n   504→[Speaker 1]\n   505→So, then, if you're going to do a depth first search? What are the variables that you need to keep track of, right?\n   506→\n   507→[Speaker 3]\n   508→Right?\n   509→\n   510→[Speaker 2]\n   511→It's usually the note, um?\n   512→\n   513→These people talking? Especially, I thought it would be like, uh, I can use a stack. And breadboard search would be easier because it's like level. More than like? Okay.\n   514→\n   515→[Speaker 1]\n   516→That makes sense\n   517→\n   518→[Speaker 2]\n   519→Down.\n   520→\n   521→[Speaker 1]\n   522→If you do do a level traversal, then you have you have the level of the tree that you're operating on, right?\n   523→\n   524→[Speaker 2]\n   525→Yes, yes. So, yeah, I was. I was stuck for. Uh, stuck at that point for a lot of time. Like, once I have the levels. How would I know which ones would be like? In the view.\n   526→\n   527→[Speaker 1]\n   528→Well, so technically. Anything on a lower level beats anything on a higher level, so you can just blanket override everything on a lower level, right? As always winning, yes,\n   529→\n   530→[Speaker 2]\n   531→As\n   532→\n   533→[Speaker 1]\n   534→You Traverse.\n   535→\n   536→[Speaker 2]\n   537→Okay, so. Um.\n   538→\n   539→Yeah, so basically, anything on the lower level would be involved\n   540→\n   541→[Speaker 4]\n   542→In the output.\n   543→\n   544→[Speaker 2]\n   545→Straight. I just got a little bit confused over there.\n   546→\n   547→Yeah, I would start with like, uh, first making. Maybe, like, I can start off from there.\n   548→\n   549→For every level.\n   550→\n   551→I have.\n   552→\n   553→So I can start with having.\n   554→\n   555→Note. And I'm adding.\n   556→\n   557→Corp it first note?\n   558→\n   559→And.\n   560→\n   561→Stop at the roof now. Um, I can do DQ of boat.\n   562→\n   563→Each known I'm adding, it's still running.\n   564→\n   565→Verses from 10. Yeah, I'm just contemplating if I should use like DFS or DFS. Because. I need the levels.\n   566→\n   567→Are you just trying\n   568→\n   569→[Speaker 1]\n   570→To figure out how to do a BFS or?\n   571→\n   572→[Speaker 2]\n   573→No, I, I, uh, I was confused if? I should be using DFS or I'm still like on the plating. Which one would be? I\n   574→\n   575→[Speaker 1]\n   576→Think BFS will work just great. So let's just go ahead with the BFS.\n   577→\n   578→[Speaker 2]\n   579→Got it. Okay, I can, um. Start doing that, um? So, for each note. So, first, I start with the root and then.\n   580→\n   581→So, while I have something in my? No, thank you. I'm going to add.\n   582→\n   583→Yeah, first.\n   584→\n   585→[Speaker 4]\n   586→18\n   587→\n   588→[Speaker 2]\n   589→Equals.\n   590→\n   591→If this part it popped?\n   592→\n   593→Pop dot white?\n   594→\n   595→And I would like continue because? That's not. Lower level.\n   596→\n   597→A picture.\n   598→\n   599→Okay, first, I'll get.\n   600→\n   601→I don't have.\n   602→\n   603→Does the double-ended Q make sense?\n   604→\n   605→This one right here. Um.\n   606→\n   607→[Speaker 1]\n   608→Why, I mean, you could probably do with a d? I think so. I mean, what are you gonna do with the DQ? Functionality.\n   609→\n   610→[Speaker 2]\n   611→I just trying to like get the elements from each level.\n   612→\n   613→So as I go? So this, and when I reach the end of this. Um. While I have?\n   614→\n   615→The previous of the last level of the notes. So that I can add.\n   616→\n   617→[Speaker 1]\n   618→So, I'm not sure I follow. What the? Why you need a\n   619→\n   620→[Speaker 3]\n   621→Left and right?\n   622→\n   623→[Speaker 1]\n   624→And I'm not saying it's wrong. I'm just saying, I don't understand why you need yeah.\n   625→\n   626→[Speaker 2]\n   627→Right? Yeah, my. My thought process was to just get like.\n   628→\n   629→Left and right notes.\n   630→\n   631→[Speaker 1]\n   632→Oh, you mean the left and right sub-nodes, or do you mean like the left and right of your Q?\n   633→\n   634→[Speaker 2]\n   635→Left and right?\n   636→\n   637→[Speaker 4]\n   638→The.\n   639→\n   640→[Speaker 1]\n   641→Okay.\n   642→\n   643→[Speaker 2]\n   644→I'm sorry, yeah, I just. I got confused with the.\n   645→\n   646→Y'all. Yeah, I have to like back up a little bit and. I'll be like, ink. Once more.\n   647→\n   648→Let's see.\n   649→\n   650→Traveling. This. If it's a BFS, I can. Second, fourth of them are now there. I can add it to the Q or I can add it to the output.\n   651→\n   652→My only problem.\n   653→\n   654→Dfs would be.\n   655→\n   656→I was thinking.\n   657→\n   658→That would be a little bit messy, so that's why I'm hesitating a bit with TFS. But BFS is also.\n   659→\n   660→You make a level. Leather or?\n   661→\n   662→I'm sorry. Can you tell me one more time, uh, probably? I got a bit confused a little bit, um, enjoy me one more time, like, why five is not seen again? Probably, I got the visualization wrong. Um,\n   663→\n   664→[Speaker 1]\n   665→No, I mean, five. Basically, what happens is five and nine are operating in the same position, right?\n   666→\n   667→[Speaker 2]\n   668→And so we just\n   669→\n   670→[Speaker 1]\n   671→Picked one. At random, that would be the the node that was seen. So, it, I would also accept for the output 425, 3. Right. So like this?\n   672→\n   673→[Speaker 2]\n   674→This\n   675→\n   676→[Speaker 1]\n   677→Output is correct, but also. This output would be perfectly valid.\n   678→\n   679→[Speaker 2]\n   680→Okay.\n   681→\n   682→So, these are in like the same.\n   683→\n   684→Okay, um?\n   685→\n   686→Yeah, this would.\n   687→\n   688→We're only choosing one. Each level. Okay.\n   689→\n   690→Right, so?\n   691→\n   692→I can do is? Starbers through each node. Once I hit. Uh, base case.\n   693→\n   694→That means I.\n   695→\n   696→You want to level?\n   697→\n   698→Thank you! I can use another. Data structure to know what levels consist of. Um. So I can help with the hash map. Alternates.\n   699→\n   700→For each one, I'll have like a level counter.\n   701→\n   702→And. For each of these, I would do. While known Q abdomen? Plus equals one, and for each level I would add.\n   703→\n   704→Step level. Okay, and this would be like. Um, I can do a default dictionary of. A list. So they can offend the children of that level.\n   705→\n   706→Start open. Um. No. Left and similarly up to hash map. Level, no dot, right?\n   707→\n   708→So, what this gives me is like a hashmap for each level. I have notes. Once I have.\n   709→\n   710→Um.\n   711→\n   712→I'm gonna do, actually. I'm gonna do a pop. I probably would.\n   713→\n   714→Unfortunate you for this one? So what I'll do is just?\n   715→\n   716→So?\n   717→\n   718→[Speaker 1]\n   719→I actually think we're out of time here. Um,\n   720→\n   721→[Speaker 2]\n   722→Oh, got it. Yeah.\n   723→\n   724→[Speaker 1]\n   725→But I, I understand exactly where you're going with this. So, thank you.\n   726→\n   727→[Speaker 2]\n   728→Um.\n   729→\n   730→[Speaker 1]\n   731→Cool, all right. So, with the last little bit of time here. Um, can you? Do you have any questions about, you know, Amazon? Uh, then I might be able to answer for you.\n   732→\n   733→[Speaker 2]\n   734→Yeah, um, I would like to ask, like, how you would measure or how a team member is measured on what metrics, uh, like? Or they evaluated. Or how's the work evaluated?\n   735→\n   736→[Speaker 1]\n   737→It really depends on a lot of different factors, um. But for a like, entry level engineer. It's really about output, right, like? Um. It isn't necessary. There's no hard rules like, you need this many code reviews. This, you need this many merges. You need this many prod deployments. It's really about given what your manager's expectations have been set for you, like, do you? Able to? You know? Produce content that is applicable to your role. Like, it's not necessarily like, oh, you didn't submit enough code, so you're not going to get, you know, you're gonna get a bad rating this quarter. It's, it's really, did you do the things that were asked of you, whether that be code. Like, a lot of times, there's a lot of research that goes into things there's documents you might need to write. There's debugging operational.\n   738→\n   739→Very, very dependent upon. Kind of what your role is on your team.\n   740→\n   741→[Speaker 2]\n   742→Got it, and what would be the one suggestion you would give to your Juniors, or like just coming into Amazon?\n   743→\n   744→[Speaker 1]\n   745→Um. It's definitely that you are going to be drinking from a fire hose for a while, because there's a lot of stuff. Um. It is important to do your best to research things yourself so that you are forced to learn. Um. But that does not mean that you should. Waste your time. Um, trying to figure something out when you're not going to, and so, to actually ask your people. Asking doesn't always mean. Um, what is the answer? It's, do you know where I can learn more about this? Because that's also a could be a very useful, um, way that you can continue to learn more and also. You know, not keep spinning. Trying to get something figured out? Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, that should be it my my side. Cool, all right. Well, thank you so much for taking the time. Thank you all right. Take care.\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious. If it does, you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code.

How are you?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nDoing\n\n[Speaker 2]\nGood\n\n[Speaker 1]\nDoing good? However, your other interviews been.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, pretty good. It was fun interacting with both of them.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nGood, all right. So? Let's go ahead and get to it. So the way this is gonna go? Uh, yeah, we'll do some introductions and then. I'm going to ask you a few questions about yourself just to get some understanding of your background, and then we're going to go into a coding question. I like to save the, you know, the Lion's Share of the interview for the coding portion? To make sure you have enough time to show off your skills. Um, and then I'll save five minutes from the end of the hour, uh, just for us to, um, just so you can ask me any questions you might have about what it's like to work\n\n[Speaker 3]\nAt Amazon. Um,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo just.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nKeep that in mind when you're going through the coding part, um. The the time.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCool.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAll right, so introductions tell me a little about yourself. I'm sure I\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAm a software developer currently working for Tulsa City County libraries, and uh, my main responsibilities would be working on web applications and mobile applications, um, there are usually like three types that the library maintains. The first one being the customer facing application. Um, and this includes, like both iPhone and Android mobile apps, and the second type would be web applications could just internal staff where they can. Where they can moderate the content of the mobile applications and store all the information and data. And the third type would be like the main website Library website, which is. Managed by Drupal or content management system. So, I got a good opportunity to work on all of these different kinds of applications. Other than this, I got an opportunity to work with two startups startup companies back in Arizona when I was studying at Arizona State University. Um, I was also. Tutoring for undergraduate students back in my University? And other than my work and outside of my work responsibilities and hobbies, I usually try to build some personal projects. Uh, this way I can try new text tag. So, um? Yeah, I am really excited about the. Uh, Amazon's opportunity because\n\n[Speaker 4]\nIt really closely aligns with my interests and values.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nCool!\n\n[Speaker 3]\nAll\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight. A little bit about me, uh? I'm a software developer at Amazon. I've been here for about. Huh, eight years? Um, and I've worked in a variety of different places. I started my career as an intern. And then went and got hired full time after college. I've worked in a large number of different places. I started in Alexa doing voice communication. I moved over to Prime air with the Drone delivery. Side of the company, and I built a lot of the on the ground maintenance software. From there, I moved into asbx, which stands for Amazon software Builder experience. Um, where I worked on the operator tooling piece. So, basically, how do developers interact with their? Production environments in order to perform operations when things go wrong and so forth. Um, and now I am on, uh, we call the golden path team.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWe\n\n[Speaker 1]\nKind of come up with recommendations for how you should be running your services. Um, to make sure that you are doing what's best for your customers, as well as identifying gaps where we think that things could be better than working with teams to own the solutions or building the solutions our self. If there is no real good owner?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah. All right, um? Let's just jump right on in. Uh, can you tell me about a time, uh, when you realize you needed a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm, I would say, um. When I initially started with Tulsa libraries, I did not have much of PHP background. All I had was a conceptual. Theoretical practice, but I never had, like, Hands-On practice for that. So initially, I was not tasked with any back-end related tasks. They were all front-end. Already familiar with. So, after that, during that time, I saw that most of the applications there had were very heavily based on PHP. So, I thought that it would be really nice to start or get a head start for the PHP back-end or PHP language in generals because there was a lot happening. All the API calls all the database calls. All of these were happening in PHP, even for the mobile applications so. Good idea to actually dive deep before I am given the actual back in class. So this is when I started reading company documentation, and then I started reading the code base. Writing down all the flows. Like, I remember making flow charts, and uh, Maps. See how the behind the scenes is actually working. So, this was when it was in the beginning stage where I had to like dive deep into the backing portion of the company.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nCool! Um.\n\nSorry.\n\nSo? Can you tell me more about like what? Which are like the key learnings you got from this experience were?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nKey warnings warnings. Learnings. Yeah. Yeah, sure, um. Like, um? The first thing was when I, uh, started looking at the database. First thing was, I panicked because. All I knew was the basic language like basic syntax and the things that were happening were very, uh, deep. So, first, I was panicking, and then I just calmed myself down, and I told myself that starting with a basics again, I crushed up my Basics, and then I looked into a lot of online tutorials. And this was all during the training period, so? My first lesson was to not panic immediately. I don't understand anything. Because there are lots of documentations. There are lots of tutorials, and with this, my manager also was very friendly. They were my whole team was very open for to me for the entire period of training, so that helped me to calm down a little bit. And then I started like, uh, absorbing all the\n\n[Speaker 4]\nAll the PHP stuff.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAnd the second thing would be asking the seniors because when I did not understand something I had this, I had this habit of doing it myself or sitting for long time periods and trying to figure out myself in my head. I'm, I don't want to bother my seniors with the questions that I could have solved myself. And then, when I started asking seniors, I got to know that they're really open to like helping Juniors because.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nThey are more experienced. They can easily understand what is working well, so the\n\n[Speaker 2]\nMost important lesson I learned was to ask senior when when it's very hard for you to figure out something so that I don't waste time in the process.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhere did you? How did you learn how to draw the line between? Something you should go figure out and learn on your own versus something that would be more effective just by asking a senior.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm, the first, uh, paint that I would get was, if there are, if there is something similar online, like if someone has a similar similar problem, and they have solved it, even though I don't understand the solution.\n\n[Speaker 4]\nI can actually. Go through that couple of times to understand\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWhat's happening. The problem comes when there is no proven solution out there for me to learn from. So, if I'm if I'm wasting days or probably weeks, just on one problem, then that's when it's like a red red flag or a red red alert that I have to ask my senior. Like minimum or maximum of like two days. It should be good that I can solve it myself.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay. Um. So, if I recall, you were talking about having to learn how your database works, right? Um. Yes, what kind of database was it?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI lose my sequel, okay?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAnd I'm guessing you just didn't have exposure to my sequel before.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOh no, I had exposure to my sequel before, but I did not have, uh, how the database connections are made with PHP, and it was completely different. Syntax PHD had like a whole different syntax than usual. Did they\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUse, like, uh orm, or was it just like raw SQL query kind of deal?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm, it, it was raw SQL queries most of the time. Yes, okay.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nInteresting. Um.\n\nDid you? Were you familiar with PHP as well going in?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, I'm sorry. What was that?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWere you familiar with PHP as well? Uh, going into this.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUh, not, not much because I did not have a PHP backing mostly was, like, JavaScript, so I was pretty familiar with JavaScript. I have, uh, I did my basic syntax, or like going through, like basic tutorials before, um, joining the company. So I had like basic syntax, but I never had, like, practical experience. I've never written down like programs and methods in PHP before.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThat makes sense. How long Emilio does it? Uh, how did you go about learning PHP? I'm curious. I've never had to do it myself.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm, yeah, it's just like starting out with writing, uh, small functions or methods, myself, or like replicating what is in the code base already? And if I don't understand like a keyword or any word that is or any type or function that is used, then I would just, uh, search it online and I'll get like the. Description or the tutorial, then go from it. Yeah, since? It was, like, very in a flow, you know,\n\n[Speaker 4]\nSequential flow. It was easier for me.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI could get an idea of where to start learning, so that helped a lot. What was the\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhat's the hardest part about learning PHP?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI would say the syntax for sure. It was super confusing in the beginning, like right. When I looked at it, there were a lot of, uh, different things going on. It's not as straightforward as JavaScript. And they were like dollar signs, uh, they were different, uh, symbols, and and that, like, really overwhelmed. So, I think getting the first? Squish towards learning towards that was hard okay, but\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOnce\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI got used to it, I was okay, so I\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHave no idea how PHP works like, literally at all. So what, what are these like random symbols, like if you could tell me what some of the random symbols of what they do. That'd be cool. Oh yeah,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm, so some of them are used for like variables. You can, like, inject the variables into the functions. So, uh, let's say, for?\n\nLike for print statements for database connections or any variables that were there, and I've never seen that syntax before, so\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThat is weird. Okay. All right, any any other ones or any other like weird PHP isms? And you thought were fun, um? You can say, no, it's fine.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, no, yeah, I think the whole, uh, syntax itself, is like different. So, it was like a very new experience. Learning it.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm, yeah. That makes sense. Okay, cool. I think I got enough. I don't need to talk about PHP anymore. I've heard enough horror stories about it's the existence, so. Um. Cool. Okay, so? Can you tell me about a time? Um, when you needed to influence a peer who had a differing opinion about a shared goal.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm, yes, I, um. So, I was thinking I had a couple of instances here. Um. So, if I get the question, right? So, having like a different opinion on something similar?\n\nCorrect, yeah.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, so an example would be like? I need to create a database for my service. I want to use SQL and they want to use nosql. Like, how did you guys, right, um?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nHow did you guys\n\n[Speaker 1]\nCome to an agreement on what the end result was going to be?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm, yeah, I would say it was in terms of one, uh, technology, that we wanted to use. Actually, it was, uh, gitlab. So, um. Um, what happened was right now. Currently, the company doesn't have, like, an integrated tool where all the developers communicate in the same platform. Um, it's like a normal kit basic repository, uh, where we just like commit our changes. So, um. What happened is the team had a couple of, uh, meetings with the kid lab team, and they were pitching the idea that we need to integrate, uh, the gitlab into? Our development. Team. So, uh, the entire team, along with our manager, they would not really. They're not really into that idea, and my manager told that they would probably like try it some other time, and they were not looking for any integration, uh tool, but since I had like experience with gitlab before, um? He told them that this would be a really good tool to integrate with our system, so that's when. We, my manager, set up a separate meeting just for the developers, and they asked me to, like, present, uh, what my ideas were, and why I got that. So that's when I had to like, um. That my opinion of why I am introducing this one, the the gitlab, to um, the current system, and they were asking, like, why, I thought it was good. Um, and yeah, uh, that was like a different opinion from the entire team.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo? You wanted you. You have experience with gitlab and you wanted to integrate gitlab and your team didn't really want to integrate gitlab and so you had it. So I'm just curious, what was your team using? For Source control before, like, you used git, but you just didn't have a central repo.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, so we had a central Loop built on the gift view, but it was not something like GitHub, where? Um, so, it was just like a basic, uh, staff internal staff application, which just had, like, the repository a basic view of what the repositories were. So it was like super basic, but so it was something sorry. Go ahead.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nHow did you share code?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm, share code.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nLike, if I, so the way, the way I understand, I just want to make sure I understand kind of the setup you guys have. Like, I have GitHub. Right where I I push code to it, and then my teammate can pull code from the same place, and so, like, there's this, the the master up in the cloud, and then we both have our own internal repos that mirror it. So it sounds like you didn't have that Central thing, and you just had GitHub. You're just like git repositories locally, and that was it. Is\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNot as? Good ass GitHub, but it is like a central, uh, platform. Oh,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, but it only\n\n[Speaker 2]\nHas like repositories and the max we can do is just like clone the repositories and push the code. That's all we can do.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nWe can't do like code reviews, or we can do pull requests. Oh.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, you had to get server, but it was not. It wasn't a function. It wasn't hadn't have all the bells and whistles of code reviews like commit hooks, so you could do deployments all that kind of stuff. Okay,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nSo we only had like our own repositories, and we used to push to this Central repository, and then that's it. We couldn't do anything extra, um, and that was like a pretty basic application that was built way before I was in the company, so I was suggesting that we.\n\nRobust tool where we can do all the code reviews pull requests. We can also integrate or know who is working on what task\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAnd the\n\n[Speaker 2]\nCommunication. Like, I know gitlab does like gyra, uh, integration as well, so I felt like it's gonna be an all-in-one vacation. That was the main reason why I was pushing for it.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThat makes sense. Okay. Um. So? You basically had to go give them the presentation about gitlab so. Before, before I ask about that, were you successful? And getting them to start using gitlab.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm, I would say, um, I was successful for them to, like, postpone the. The using of that because it was a really hectic time for the library because it was a summer reading program time, so they were super busy, so my instead of like for a strict, no, I think I was able to make them for. Yes, people at least use like a free tier, or like basic Services. So I got them to that point. So,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah, it's not a no, it's a yes, when we have time, we'll look at it. Yes, okay, all\n\n[Speaker 2]\nRight. So, with\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThe outcome in mind, like, like?\n\nThat, you know, this was the right thing for the company.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, um. So, the first thing I told them about where I used to get lab, so that was for my internship and for my internship. Also, it was the same company size. They were a startup company, but still, uh, I was letting them know how, like, the communication between the team members was very.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nTo.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nTool, and I gave them some examples and also. Um, I told them why it feels better because what happened was? When, when we were doing a certain task for summer reading program, so there was a slight miscommunication, and I wouldn't say like miscommunication, but it was an assumption made that my team member was doing a task, and they thought that I was doing the task so. Year. We were like maintaining different applications for different. Roles. It was very hard to like, keep track of what exactly we are doing at a certain point. So I mentioned this example to them. And that's when, uh, my teammate also agreed to it, saying that, yes, this did happen. It would be better to have, like, an all-in-one application.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, so I'm assuming this was a very a fairly recent story considering? It's probably summer right now.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, yeah, it was. It was, like, in the beginning of the development phase, yeah.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIt was around like April.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay, so then have they come back to it to start using it yet? Or is that still on the to-do list?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNot yet. The sum reading program has just ended, so I was thinking of like bringing that to their attention. Um, we also have like a meeting with the kids lab team itself in the future. Um, because we post, we had to postpone their meeting as well, just for the sum reading program. Alignment. Putting that idea back on the table again?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nNice. Okay, that makes sense. Cool, all right. Well. Um. Don't have any more questions about that? Um, we can go ahead and jump into the coding section.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nLet me.\n\nGo ahead and open\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThat up for you.\n\nI just gotta go fill. All this out, give me a minute.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm.\n\nOh my\n\n[Speaker 1]\nLord. Sorry, the my computer is complaining. Um, all right, so I went ahead and opened the session. Um. And you're going to be using, um? Python.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYes, okay.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhich question to ask? To do.\n\nSo? Oh, what is the? Is it triple?\n\nI forget. I think this is how you do block quotes in Python, right? Um.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, we can use the normal flashing star.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nIt's triple. Yeah.\n\nOh my Lord. You have to excuse me, I it is. It is a struggle over here. All right. So? This is the question.\n\nGo ahead and! Let me now here. Let me give you a additional.\n\nUm, prompt as well.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI'll print the view of a binary tree as seen down below, um.\n\nOr two needs fucking.\n\nAll right.\n\nA binary tree is given and. We have to print.\n\nThe view, oh the view, when you see it from below.\n\nScene from below.\n\n1493.\n\nSo I, my understanding, is that?\n\nSo, assuming that we're looking at the binary from?\n\nUm.\n\nAnd only those elements. Is that correct?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSee, say that one more time. Um, so?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nFrom what I see from the input and the output is, um. Sending a view of a binary tree from seen from below. That means, like, whatever we see, assuming that we are standing. Beneath it, and we're looking towards the binary. That'll be what we need to print it out. Yes.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm, so basically imagine you're standing underneath of the tree looking directly up, right?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay, got it.\n\nOkay, um?\n\nAll right.\n\nI'm just wondering.\n\nYeah,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI mean, Phil, just ask me questions to understand the problem, um? Please.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, uh, yeah, I was just wondering why the? Was not shown because? If I look from the tree about like four as shown, but? Five is not, uh,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo if you think about it. The which number is being shown instead of the five?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThe nine. So,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhy would the nine? I so the answer is five and nine are at the same level. And at the same depth. It could be either one. You can pick whichever one you want if there. If there's a if there's a, you know over, if they're Mashed, you can do whichever one you want. Oh.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOh, okay, got it. I've yeah, I just. The level portion fit my bad.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYeah,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThank you for that. The.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nIt's, it gets a little bit weird because the I tried to make this so that you can tell the nine. Yeah,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, sorry, sorry, yeah, I couldn't. I actually like focused on like the. Representation of it? That's good. Thank you for that, um. Is it okay if I just like? Actually, that I can't just keep it sorry. Okay, so? Yeah, go ahead\n\n[Speaker 1]\nBecause I, I can give you the stuff to get started here.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay, thank you.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nDo you have any other questions about um? Why we, how it's working?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNo, that should be it all right?\n\nGreat! So.\n\nSince this would be? All. Problems. So, what I mean by that is?\n\nSo, um? Usually visualizing it. If I stand underneath this, I should be able to see all the children. Off the tree. And if there are no children or a particular node, then I should be able to see the node itself. That's my first thought for that.\n\nSo, for this, I can, um, the way I can. Which node has children or not? Um. I have.\n\nScrubbers all the way down. To. Most bottom level.\n\nAnd if a certain node doesn't have?\n\nThe children in that level. And I added also to.\n\nI can express each one. And the base case would be. Not having anything of a child so?\n\nOh, I'm only so.\n\nType levels it?\n\nSo, what do\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYou like walk me through your thought process? What are you getting held up on?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm, I was trying to see, um. So I know? That. My child notes, like, at whatever are at the least, uh.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nLevel,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThey would be seen, or they would be added to the output.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nBut\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThe notes that do not have child notes. Will also be added to the output because I can see it directly. Does that make sense? So I,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI don't think it necessarily. You could probably process the entire graph. Regardless of whether or not it has children because, like, a node could have children and still be seen, right?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nRight, like the three here.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nRight, or if, if one, if the tree is incredibly lopsided, right? It. Could the entire right side of the root could be completely unseen because the left was so wide? Right, so I don't think it necessarily matters that you keep track of. If it has children, it almost sounds like you should just process the tree. And then process children. You know if it happens to have children don't don't over index on the children aspect of it?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYep, so then that way I would be.\n\nSo, if I am? So I should be using, like?\n\nOr centered way.\n\nFucking.\n\nOh, okay, I think.\n\nSo basically for each sense. It's a binary tree for each level. Like? Possible or the maximum children can have? Um. 2. ^ that level. So? I can see, so my thought process right now is. I can see the. Portion of that particular level.\n\nWell, that helped me, um.\n\nI think that would be so. Let's,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nLet's take a step back and explain to me, yeah.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nHow\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYou? How do you plan on traversing the tree?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm.\n\nSo, I was planning to go. Um. Starting from the center node. Um, all the way to?\n\nAnd then to the right.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, so it's like\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIn order,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo that first, okay,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYes, yes, okay?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, then, if you're going to do a depth first search? What are the variables that you need to keep track of, right?\n\n[Speaker 3]\nRight?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nIt's usually the note, um?\n\nThese people talking? Especially, I thought it would be like, uh, I can use a stack. And breadboard search would be easier because it's like level. More than like? Okay.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThat makes sense\n\n[Speaker 2]\nDown.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nIf you do do a level traversal, then you have you have the level of the tree that you're operating on, right?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYes, yes. So, yeah, I was. I was stuck for. Uh, stuck at that point for a lot of time. Like, once I have the levels. How would I know which ones would be like? In the view.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWell, so technically. Anything on a lower level beats anything on a higher level, so you can just blanket override everything on a lower level, right? As always winning, yes,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAs\n\n[Speaker 1]\nYou Traverse.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay, so. Um.\n\nYeah, so basically, anything on the lower level would be involved\n\n[Speaker 4]\nIn the output.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nStraight. I just got a little bit confused over there.\n\nYeah, I would start with like, uh, first making. Maybe, like, I can start off from there.\n\nFor every level.\n\nI have.\n\nSo I can start with having.\n\nNote. And I'm adding.\n\nCorp it first note?\n\nAnd.\n\nStop at the roof now. Um, I can do DQ of boat.\n\nEach known I'm adding, it's still running.\n\nVerses from 10. Yeah, I'm just contemplating if I should use like DFS or DFS. Because. I need the levels.\n\nAre you just trying\n\n[Speaker 1]\nTo figure out how to do a BFS or?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nNo, I, I, uh, I was confused if? I should be using DFS or I'm still like on the plating. Which one would be? I\n\n[Speaker 1]\nThink BFS will work just great. So let's just go ahead with the BFS.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nGot it. Okay, I can, um. Start doing that, um? So, for each note. So, first, I start with the root and then.\n\nSo, while I have something in my? No, thank you. I'm going to add.\n\nYeah, first.\n\n[Speaker 4]\n18\n\n[Speaker 2]\nEquals.\n\nIf this part it popped?\n\nPop dot white?\n\nAnd I would like continue because? That's not. Lower level.\n\nA picture.\n\nOkay, first, I'll get.\n\nI don't have.\n\nDoes the double-ended Q make sense?\n\nThis one right here. Um.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nWhy, I mean, you could probably do with a d? I think so. I mean, what are you gonna do with the DQ? Functionality.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI just trying to like get the elements from each level.\n\nSo as I go? So this, and when I reach the end of this. Um. While I have?\n\nThe previous of the last level of the notes. So that I can add.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nSo, I'm not sure I follow. What the? Why you need a\n\n[Speaker 3]\nLeft and right?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nAnd I'm not saying it's wrong. I'm just saying, I don't understand why you need yeah.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nRight? Yeah, my. My thought process was to just get like.\n\nLeft and right notes.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOh, you mean the left and right sub-nodes, or do you mean like the left and right of your Q?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nLeft and right?\n\n[Speaker 4]\nThe.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOkay.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nI'm sorry, yeah, I just. I got confused with the.\n\nY'all. Yeah, I have to like back up a little bit and. I'll be like, ink. Once more.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTraveling. This. If it's a BFS, I can. Second, fourth of them are now there. I can add it to the Q or I can add it to the output.\n\nMy only problem.\n\nDfs would be.\n\nI was thinking.\n\nThat would be a little bit messy, so that's why I'm hesitating a bit with TFS. But BFS is also.\n\nYou make a level. Leather or?\n\nI'm sorry. Can you tell me one more time, uh, probably? I got a bit confused a little bit, um, enjoy me one more time, like, why five is not seen again? Probably, I got the visualization wrong. Um,\n\n[Speaker 1]\nNo, I mean, five. Basically, what happens is five and nine are operating in the same position, right?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nAnd so we just\n\n[Speaker 1]\nPicked one. At random, that would be the the node that was seen. So, it, I would also accept for the output 425, 3. Right. So like this?\n\n[Speaker 2]\nThis\n\n[Speaker 1]\nOutput is correct, but also. This output would be perfectly valid.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOkay.\n\nSo, these are in like the same.\n\nOkay, um?\n\nYeah, this would.\n\nWe're only choosing one. Each level. Okay.\n\nRight, so?\n\nI can do is? Starbers through each node. Once I hit. Uh, base case.\n\nThat means I.\n\nYou want to level?\n\nThank you! I can use another. Data structure to know what levels consist of. Um. So I can help with the hash map. Alternates.\n\nFor each one, I'll have like a level counter.\n\nAnd. For each of these, I would do. While known Q abdomen? Plus equals one, and for each level I would add.\n\nStep level. Okay, and this would be like. Um, I can do a default dictionary of. A list. So they can offend the children of that level.\n\nStart open. Um. No. Left and similarly up to hash map. Level, no dot, right?\n\nSo, what this gives me is like a hashmap for each level. I have notes. Once I have.\n\nUm.\n\nI'm gonna do, actually. I'm gonna do a pop. I probably would.\n\nUnfortunate you for this one? So what I'll do is just?\n\nSo?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nI actually think we're out of time here. Um,\n\n[Speaker 2]\nOh, got it. Yeah.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nBut I, I understand exactly where you're going with this. So, thank you.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nUm.\n\n[Speaker 1]\nCool, all right. So, with the last little bit of time here. Um, can you? Do you have any questions about, you know, Amazon? Uh, then I might be able to answer for you.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nYeah, um, I would like to ask, like, how you would measure or how a team member is measured on what metrics, uh, like? Or they evaluated. Or how's the work evaluated?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nIt really depends on a lot of different factors, um. But for a like, entry level engineer. It's really about output, right, like? Um. It isn't necessary. There's no hard rules like, you need this many code reviews. This, you need this many merges. You need this many prod deployments. It's really about given what your manager's expectations have been set for you, like, do you? Able to? You know? Produce content that is applicable to your role. Like, it's not necessarily like, oh, you didn't submit enough code, so you're not going to get, you know, you're gonna get a bad rating this quarter. It's, it's really, did you do the things that were asked of you, whether that be code. Like, a lot of times, there's a lot of research that goes into things there's documents you might need to write. There's debugging operational.\n\nVery, very dependent upon. Kind of what your role is on your team.\n\n[Speaker 2]\nGot it, and what would be the one suggestion you would give to your Juniors, or like just coming into Amazon?\n\n[Speaker 1]\nUm. It's definitely that you are going to be drinking from a fire hose for a while, because there's a lot of stuff. Um. It is important to do your best to research things yourself so that you are forced to learn. Um. But that does not mean that you should. Waste your time. Um, trying to figure something out when you're not going to, and so, to actually ask your people. Asking doesn't always mean. Um, what is the answer? It's, do you know where I can learn more about this? Because that's also a could be a very useful, um, way that you can continue to learn more and also. You know, not keep spinning. Trying to get something figured out? Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, that should be it my my side. Cool, all right. Well, thank you so much for taking the time. Thank you all right. Take care.","numLines":745,"startLine":1,"totalLines":745}}}

They showed good influencing skills by advocating for GitLab adoption despite team resistance, presenting data-driven arguments about communication issues. However, the candidate struggled significantly with the coding challenge, failing to complete a tree traversal problem and showing confusion about basic algorithm concepts.\n\n## Overall Assessment\n**Recommendation:** Inclined Not to Hire (2/4)\n\n---\n\n## Learn and Be Curious\n\nThe candidate showed proactive learning when faced with unfamiliar PHP technology at Tulsa Libraries, independently studying documentation and codebase during training period. They created flowcharts and diagrams to understand system architecture and sought help from seniors when appropriate. The candidate also demonstrated curiosity by exploring personal projects outside work to try new tech stacks.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Proactively learned PHP and database connections during training period without being assigned tasks\n- (+) Created flowcharts and system diagrams to understand code architecture\n- (+) Recognized when to ask seniors for help after 2 days of independent effort\n- (+) Pursues personal projects outside work to explore new technologies\n- (+) Studied online tutorials and replicated code patterns to learn PHP syntax\n- (+) Shows genuine interest in continuous learning and skill development\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Initially panicked when seeing complex codebase, showing lack of confidence\n- (-) Had habit of trying to solve everything alone before learning to ask for help\n- (-) Limited depth in technical explanations about what was actually learned\n- (-) No mention of sharing knowledge back with team or documenting learnings\n\n---\n\n## Earn Trust\n\nThe candidate demonstrated integrity by advocating for GitLab adoption to improve team communication and prevent task duplication issues. They presented their case with specific examples of miscommunication that had occurred and gained support from teammates who experienced the same problems. While not immediately successful, they influenced the team to postpone rather than reject the proposal.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Used personal experience from internship to build credibility for GitLab recommendation\n- (+) Provided specific example of task miscommunication to support their argument\n- (+) Gained teammate agreement by referencing shared negative experience\n- (+) Respectfully challenged team's resistance to change with data-driven approach\n- (+) Followed up persistently without being pushy about GitLab adoption\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Did not mention any personal mistakes or areas where they were wrong\n- (-) Limited demonstration of building trust through delivery and follow-through\n- (-) No examples of admitting failures or being vocally self-critical\n- (-) Could have gathered more quantitative data about productivity impact\n\n---\n\n## Technical Assessment\n\nThe candidate struggled significantly with the binary tree bottom view problem, showing confusion about basic tree traversal concepts. They oscillated between BFS and DFS approaches without clarity, failed to articulate a coherent solution strategy, and ran out of time without producing working code.

They showed good influencing skills by advocating for GitLab adoption despite team resistance, presenting data-driven arguments about communication issues. However, the candidate struggled significantly with the coding challenge, failing to complete a tree traversal problem and showing confusion about basic algorithm concepts.\n\n## Overall Assessment\n**Recommendation:** Inclined Not to Hire (2/4)\n\n---\n\n## Learn and Be Curious\n\nThe candidate showed proactive learning when faced with unfamiliar PHP technology at Tulsa Libraries, independently studying documentation and codebase during training period. They created flowcharts and diagrams to understand system architecture and sought help from seniors when appropriate. The candidate also demonstrated curiosity by exploring personal projects outside work to try new tech stacks.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Proactively learned PHP and database connections during training period without being assigned tasks\n- (+) Created flowcharts and system diagrams to understand code architecture\n- (+) Recognized when to ask seniors for help after 2 days of independent effort\n- (+) Pursues personal projects outside work to explore new technologies\n- (+) Studied online tutorials and replicated code patterns to learn PHP syntax\n- (+) Shows genuine interest in continuous learning and skill development\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Initially panicked when seeing complex codebase, showing lack of confidence\n- (-) Had habit of trying to solve everything alone before learning to ask for help\n- (-) Limited depth in technical explanations about what was actually learned\n- (-) No mention of sharing knowledge back with team or documenting learnings\n\n---\n\n## Earn Trust\n\nThe candidate demonstrated integrity by advocating for GitLab adoption to improve team communication and prevent task duplication issues. They presented their case with specific examples of miscommunication that had occurred and gained support from teammates who experienced the same problems. While not immediately successful, they influenced the team to postpone rather than reject the proposal.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Used personal experience from internship to build credibility for GitLab recommendation\n- (+) Provided specific example of task miscommunication to support their argument\n- (+) Gained teammate agreement by referencing shared negative experience\n- (+) Respectfully challenged team's resistance to change with data-driven approach\n- (+) Followed up persistently without being pushy about GitLab adoption\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Did not mention any personal mistakes or areas where they were wrong\n- (-) Limited demonstration of building trust through delivery and follow-through\n- (-) No examples of admitting failures or being vocally self-critical\n- (-) Could have gathered more quantitative data about productivity impact\n\n---\n\n## Technical Assessment\n\nThe candidate struggled significantly with the binary tree bottom view problem, showing confusion about basic tree traversal concepts. They oscillated between BFS and DFS approaches without clarity, failed to articulate a coherent solution strategy, and ran out of time without producing working code. The confusion about viewing angles and inability to visualize the problem indicates gaps in algorithmic thinking.\n\n**Strengths (+):**\n- (+) Eventually understood the problem after multiple clarifications\n- (+) Recognized that BFS might be appropriate for level-based traversal\n- (+) Attempted to use appropriate data structures (queue, hashmap)\n\n**Weaknesses (-):**\n- (-) Significant confusion about problem requirements despite clear explanation\n- (-) Unable to articulate clear approach between BFS and DFS\n- (-) Failed to produce any working code within time constraints\n- (-) Showed fundamental gaps in tree traversal understanding\n- (-) Required excessive clarification on basic concepts\n- (-) Could not translate understanding into implementation\n\n---\n\n## Communication & Interpersonal Skills\n\nThe candidate communicated professionally and showed enthusiasm for the opportunity.
