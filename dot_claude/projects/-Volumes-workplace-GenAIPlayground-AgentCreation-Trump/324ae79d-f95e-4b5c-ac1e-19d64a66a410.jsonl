This will require a few key changes:\\n\\n1. **Expand to additional regions. **Get into more regions! De-concentrate out of our primary AWS regions today - DUB, IAD, and PDX - in order to grow and scale despite challenges such as physical limitations, changes in compliance legislation, and to reduce the blast radius of outages. It's been over a decade since SDO as a whole has gotten into new regions, and we'll need to re-learn what it takes.\\n1. **Support additional latency where it's appropriate and frugal. **Enable SDO to leverage additional availability zones (AZs) and regions that are more distant than our services expect today. We'll drive experiments to assess and moderate the impact of both intra-service and inter-service latency, and leverage in-development service and data  graphs to identify where minimal latency can be introduced into the service graph.\\n1. **Make multi-region marketplaces possible (splitting .com). **Enable a single marketplace to be served across multiple regions in the steady state. We'll need this approach for our largest marketplaces, such as the US, where one region can't sustain us forever, and when smaller marketplaces pass localization legislation. By splitting use cases or customers across AWS regions, we can improve our ability to mitigate region-specific capacity constraints.\\n\\n== Grand Vision ==\\n\\nServices and data are automatically placed in the region(s) and AZ(s) they’re needed without builder effort or awareness, and guardrails ensure all new services stay region flexible from creation.\\n\\n== What can I move now? ==\\n\\nAWS region in ZAZ is open for use in SDO.\\n\\nAWS region in FRA reached the **General Availability** milestone as of December 30 2024. It is now open to all SDO teams to build services. __Please note the (% class=\\\"wikiinternallink\\\" %)[[(% class=\\\"wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink\\\" %)**Known Open Issues for MAWS FRA customers**>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Deep_Dives_and_Announcements/MAWS_FRA/#HKnownOpenIssuesforMAWSFRAcustomers]](%%) section below that describes any SDO features not yet available in FRA.__ \\n\\nIn 2024, all services that are async, latency tolerant, or don't have a direct impact on customer facing experiences should migrate from DUB to ZAZ. To get started, check out [[Per-Service Migration Guide>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Per-Service_Region_Migration_Guide/]].\\n\\nIn 2025, we will begin moving customer facing experiences and expect ES, UK, and parts of IT, FR, and IN marketplaces to be served out of ZAZ and a portion of DE marketplace out of FRA by 12/30/25. To get started please review SDO's [[Exit DUB Strategy>>https://wiki.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Deep_Dives_and_Announcements/Announcements/Exit_DUB_Strategy/]] and [[Sub-experience Migration Coordination>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Coordinating_Migrations/]] wikis. \\n\\n== Vision ==\\n\\nWe envision a future where latency-sensitive workloads operate in the region closest to our customers, and latency-insensitive workloads operate in the least expensive region that meets regulatory requirements. In this future, most services are agnostic of where their business logic and data reside, and only provide constraints and scaling signals to a central placement system solving for the Amazon-wide optimal solution balancing capacity availability signals from AWS, the optimal customer experience, regulatory compliance, and cost efficiency. With greater flexibility, peak events that require scaling beyond the available capacity of a single region can be served simultaneously from multiple regions, reducing our peak-to-mean spread and reducing CAPEX. \\n\\nTo accomplish this, we need to intentionally iterate on architectures that abstract networking and infrastructure management (e.g., moving to higher-level abstractions), reduce the number of architectural patterns SDO teams employ to build their services, improve the abstraction of telemetry and observability capabilities, and centralize the optimization of undifferentiated decisions currently made imperfectly due to distributed ownership (e.g., placement of capacity, timeout management, data migrations). \\n\\nWe begin by building core components that enable and reduce the effort of our most urgent cross-region moves, while guiding individual teams to adopt solutions and foundational systems that meet them at their current architectural abstraction and maturity (e.g., provide solutions for each of Lambda, managed runtimes, and JVM-on-EC2/ECS). We then intentionally build on the learnings from cross-region migrations into these central solutions and patterns, evolving SDO services with minimum builder toil (e.g., ship features via merge-from-live). \\n\\n\\nLearn more at our [[definition of a region flexible service>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Deep_Dives_and_Announcements/Definition_of_a_Region_Flexible_Service/]].\\n\\n== Tenets (% style=\\\"font-size:22px\\\" %)(//Unless you know better...)//(%%) ==\\n\\n//**Region Flexibility (Updated August, 2023)**//\\n\\n1. We will use this moment to make multi-year decisions, region flex means multiple regions //and// multiple moves over a long time horizon.\\n1. Region flexibility is a requirement for business continuity. We create visibility into the risks from choices, and ramifications of non-compliance using our best practices, guidance, and compulsory directives.\\n1. Region flexibility is not a lever for all deprecations, migrations, or tech-debt reductions; we prefer fewer coordinated parts to achieve our vision vs more.\\n1. Solution uniformity is a strategy, not a goal, no one solution will fit all; however customizations and bespoke solutions are expensive in the long term.\\n1. We prefer to provide precision in our shepherding of teams and migrations, employing central visibility, data, and tooling; but accept that our guidance must be sufficient where ambiguity exists.\\n1. Our data is precious and democratized; we are accountable and transparent in all we do and prioritize data accuracy ahead of recency to ensure we maintain trust with our partners.\\n\\n//**Exit DUB (Updated June, 2024)**//\\n\\n1. (% style=\\\"tab-stops:list .25in\\\" %)Supporting capacity assurance for Amazon and AWS customers is higher priority than architectural improvements or making services region flexible. Where these enhancements do not add risk, Amazon intentionally invests in them.\\n1. (% style=\\\"tab-stops:list .25in\\\" %)Experience owners, in partnership with RFE, own the responsibility of business continuity and impact in both duration and magnitude to the customer experiences (e.g., latency, availability); RFE will help resolve these decisions and provide visibility at appropriate business levels.\\n1. (% style=\\\"tab-stops:list .25in\\\" %)RFE owns enabling and guiding SDO teams, identifying broadly impacting bottlenecks, regulating the federated impact of owners’ actions, and auditing progress on migrations and region flexibility. SDO teams own migrating their services & data and making those systems region flexible.\\n1. (% style=\\\"tab-stops:list .25in\\\" %)Decoupling the work of individual teams as they set up their services, experiment, and make their data accessible cross-region is a priority for meeting exit DUB timelines.\\n1. (% style=\\\"tab-stops:list .25in\\\" %)RFE prefers to move data and workloads fewer times but recognizes this will not always be feasible (e.g., first move IN Shopping experiences to ZAZ, then HYD).\\n\\n== What does the Region Flexibility team do? ==\\n\\nThe Region Flexibility team is responsible for establishing new solutions and architectural patterns to help services owners get into regions more quickly, in partnership with experts at Amazon working in domains like data and configuration. We own the vision for how SDO gets into new regions, and influence which regions we move into considering regulatory requirements, latency, cost efficiency, and developer experience. You can review solutions that we are developing under \\\"Accelerators\\\" section.\\n\\n== How does Region Flexibility impact me as a service owner? ==\\n\\nToday, most of the work to get into new regions is on service owners. While the Region Flexibility team's goal is to eventually automate this work, we have a long way to go, and we expect our first region expansion/migration programs will be the most manual. Service owners are expected to set up their services in new region and then migrate their data and traffic, potentially in coordination with other teams. Our best knowledge on what it takes to get into a new region is captured in our [[Per-Service Region Migration Guide>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Per-Service_Region_Migration_Guide/]] and in our [[Region Flex Portal>>https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/]].\\n\\nAs you work through your first region expansion efforts, look for where automation could help you in the future, and either do that work now, capture it for the future, or where a solution could be widely reusable, share with the Region Flexibility team!</textarea>\\n</div>\"}}"}]}]},"uuid":"a85c24a3-6783-484f-9fdc-f17ddfc1e099","timestamp":"2025-08-15T21:56:01.304Z","toolUseResult":[{"type":"text","text":"{\"content\":{\"status\":\"success\",\"content\":\"<div class=\\\"row document-header\\\">\\n  <div class=\\\"document-info col-xs-12 \\\">\\n                    <div id=\\\"document-title\\\">\\n      <h1>Wiki source code of <a href=\\\"/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/\\\">Region Flexibility</a></h1>\\n    </div>\\n        <div id=\\\"xdocPrimaryOwner\\\">\\n              <b>Primary Owner </b> <a href=\\\"https://permissions.amazon.com/group.mhtml?group=region-flexibility-engineering-all&group_type=ldap\\\"> region-flexibility-engineering-all (LDAP) </a>\\n          </div>\\n                                                                      <div class=\\\"xdocLastModification\\\">\\n        Last modified 1 day ago by <span class=\\\"wikilink\\\"><a href=\\\"/bin/view/XWiki/rohanso\\\">rohanso</a></span>.\\n      </div>\\n      </div>\\n  </div>\\n<hr class=\\\"titleDivider\\\" />\\n  <div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<div>\\n  <a href=\\\"/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/?viewer=code&showlinenumbers=1\\\" id=\\\"toggleLineNumbers\\\">Show line numbers</a>\\n  <textarea readonly=\\\"readonly\\\" class=\\\"wiki-code\\\" rows=\\\"25\\\" cols=\\\"80\\\">{{transclude name=\\\"Buckeye\\\"/}}\\n\\n{{toc depth=\\\"2\\\"/}}\\n\\n\\n(% class=\\\"box infomessage\\\" %)\\n(((\\nIf you are here because you received a Policy Engine violation or an email about submitting your services migration plans in [[Region Flexibility Portal>>https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/]], please follow the [[instructions >>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Migration_Plans/]]as specified in the Policy Engine or contact rfe-tpm@ for further clarification.\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\If you think you are __**wrongly flagged as in scope**__ for a sub-experience migration, you should contact sub-experience Migration Coordinator responsible for managing the scope to resolve the issue.

This will require a few key changes:\\n\\n1. **Expand to additional regions. **Get into more regions! De-concentrate out of our primary AWS regions today - DUB, IAD, and PDX - in order to grow and scale despite challenges such as physical limitations, changes in compliance legislation, and to reduce the blast radius of outages. It's been over a decade since SDO as a whole has gotten into new regions, and we'll need to re-learn what it takes.\\n1. **Support additional latency where it's appropriate and frugal. **Enable SDO to leverage additional availability zones (AZs) and regions that are more distant than our services expect today. We'll drive experiments to assess and moderate the impact of both intra-service and inter-service latency, and leverage in-development service and data  graphs to identify where minimal latency can be introduced into the service graph.\\n1. **Make multi-region marketplaces possible (splitting .com). **Enable a single marketplace to be served across multiple regions in the steady state. We'll need this approach for our largest marketplaces, such as the US, where one region can't sustain us forever, and when smaller marketplaces pass localization legislation. By splitting use cases or customers across AWS regions, we can improve our ability to mitigate region-specific capacity constraints.\\n\\n== Grand Vision ==\\n\\nServices and data are automatically placed in the region(s) and AZ(s) they’re needed without builder effort or awareness, and guardrails ensure all new services stay region flexible from creation.\\n\\n== What can I move now? ==\\n\\nAWS region in ZAZ is open for use in SDO.\\n\\nAWS region in FRA reached the **General Availability** milestone as of December 30 2024. It is now open to all SDO teams to build services. __Please note the (% class=\\\"wikiinternallink\\\" %)[[(% class=\\\"wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink\\\" %)**Known Open Issues for MAWS FRA customers**>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Deep_Dives_and_Announcements/MAWS_FRA/#HKnownOpenIssuesforMAWSFRAcustomers]](%%) section below that describes any SDO features not yet available in FRA.__ \\n\\nIn 2024, all services that are async, latency tolerant, or don't have a direct impact on customer facing experiences should migrate from DUB to ZAZ. To get started, check out [[Per-Service Migration Guide>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Per-Service_Region_Migration_Guide/]].\\n\\nIn 2025, we will begin moving customer facing experiences and expect ES, UK, and parts of IT, FR, and IN marketplaces to be served out of ZAZ and a portion of DE marketplace out of FRA by 12/30/25. To get started please review SDO's [[Exit DUB Strategy>>https://wiki.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Deep_Dives_and_Announcements/Announcements/Exit_DUB_Strategy/]] and [[Sub-experience Migration Coordination>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Coordinating_Migrations/]] wikis. \\n\\n== Vision ==\\n\\nWe envision a future where latency-sensitive workloads operate in the region closest to our customers, and latency-insensitive workloads operate in the least expensive region that meets regulatory requirements. In this future, most services are agnostic of where their business logic and data reside, and only provide constraints and scaling signals to a central placement system solving for the Amazon-wide optimal solution balancing capacity availability signals from AWS, the optimal customer experience, regulatory compliance, and cost efficiency. With greater flexibility, peak events that require scaling beyond the available capacity of a single region can be served simultaneously from multiple regions, reducing our peak-to-mean spread and reducing CAPEX. \\n\\nTo accomplish this, we need to intentionally iterate on architectures that abstract networking and infrastructure management (e.g., moving to higher-level abstractions), reduce the number of architectural patterns SDO teams employ to build their services, improve the abstraction of telemetry and observability capabilities, and centralize the optimization of undifferentiated decisions currently made imperfectly due to distributed ownership (e.g., placement of capacity, timeout management, data migrations). \\n\\nWe begin by building core components that enable and reduce the effort of our most urgent cross-region moves, while guiding individual teams to adopt solutions and foundational systems that meet them at their current architectural abstraction and maturity (e.g., provide solutions for each of Lambda, managed runtimes, and JVM-on-EC2/ECS). We then intentionally build on the learnings from cross-region migrations into these central solutions and patterns, evolving SDO services with minimum builder toil (e.g., ship features via merge-from-live). \\n\\n\\nLearn more at our [[definition of a region flexible service>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Deep_Dives_and_Announcements/Definition_of_a_Region_Flexible_Service/]].\\n\\n== Tenets (% style=\\\"font-size:22px\\\" %)(//Unless you know better...)//(%%) ==\\n\\n//**Region Flexibility (Updated August, 2023)**//\\n\\n1. We will use this moment to make multi-year decisions, region flex means multiple regions //and// multiple moves over a long time horizon.\\n1. Region flexibility is a requirement for business continuity. We create visibility into the risks from choices, and ramifications of non-compliance using our best practices, guidance, and compulsory directives.\\n1. Region flexibility is not a lever for all deprecations, migrations, or tech-debt reductions; we prefer fewer coordinated parts to achieve our vision vs more.\\n1. Solution uniformity is a strategy, not a goal, no one solution will fit all; however customizations and bespoke solutions are expensive in the long term.\\n1. We prefer to provide precision in our shepherding of teams and migrations, employing central visibility, data, and tooling; but accept that our guidance must be sufficient where ambiguity exists.\\n1. Our data is precious and democratized; we are accountable and transparent in all we do and prioritize data accuracy ahead of recency to ensure we maintain trust with our partners.\\n\\n//**Exit DUB (Updated June, 2024)**//\\n\\n1. (% style=\\\"tab-stops:list .25in\\\" %)Supporting capacity assurance for Amazon and AWS customers is higher priority than architectural improvements or making services region flexible. Where these enhancements do not add risk, Amazon intentionally invests in them.\\n1. (% style=\\\"tab-stops:list .25in\\\" %)Experience owners, in partnership with RFE, own the responsibility of business continuity and impact in both duration and magnitude to the customer experiences (e.g., latency, availability); RFE will help resolve these decisions and provide visibility at appropriate business levels.\\n1. (% style=\\\"tab-stops:list .25in\\\" %)RFE owns enabling and guiding SDO teams, identifying broadly impacting bottlenecks, regulating the federated impact of owners’ actions, and auditing progress on migrations and region flexibility. SDO teams own migrating their services & data and making those systems region flexible.\\n1. (% style=\\\"tab-stops:list .25in\\\" %)Decoupling the work of individual teams as they set up their services, experiment, and make their data accessible cross-region is a priority for meeting exit DUB timelines.\\n1. (% style=\\\"tab-stops:list .25in\\\" %)RFE prefers to move data and workloads fewer times but recognizes this will not always be feasible (e.g., first move IN Shopping experiences to ZAZ, then HYD).\\n\\n== What does the Region Flexibility team do? ==\\n\\nThe Region Flexibility team is responsible for establishing new solutions and architectural patterns to help services owners get into regions more quickly, in partnership with experts at Amazon working in domains like data and configuration. We own the vision for how SDO gets into new regions, and influence which regions we move into considering regulatory requirements, latency, cost efficiency, and developer experience. You can review solutions that we are developing under \\\"Accelerators\\\" section.\\n\\n== How does Region Flexibility impact me as a service owner? ==\\n\\nToday, most of the work to get into new regions is on service owners. While the Region Flexibility team's goal is to eventually automate this work, we have a long way to go, and we expect our first region expansion/migration programs will be the most manual. Service owners are expected to set up their services in new region and then migrate their data and traffic, potentially in coordination with other teams. Our best knowledge on what it takes to get into a new region is captured in our [[Per-Service Region Migration Guide>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Per-Service_Region_Migration_Guide/]] and in our [[Region Flex Portal>>https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/]].\\n\\nAs you work through your first region expansion efforts, look for where automation could help you in the future, and either do that work now, capture it for the future, or where a solution could be widely reusable, share with the Region Flexibility team!</textarea>\\n</div>\"}}"}]}

Remember the good old lookout days where we had a pager number engineer to change\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"these things. So I think this might be my last slide. So the devices we monitor, there's three types\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"that we monitor today is kind of ever changing list. I would bet the next year you guys from project\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"to do additional writers. But today we have these border transit layer devices, those beer trotters\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"and the P R F P C routers, which this is like a new network fabric called Spinal Cap. Super\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"important. But basically these the border transit routers are the ones between our border and\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"transit providers. So they're kind of aggressive. Okay, with your side, they're kind of the ingress\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"points to the Amazon border edge of the Amazon. And so the customers here bordering Coming porter\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"outgoing supporter, incoming is traditional in what we use for most of our Adidas detection, because\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"that's really gives a really broad picture club from Metro net flow. Also, how many devices the\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"border Agler devices are eternal routers that are kind of a next lawyer down in the east to network.\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"Uh, so these are things like Big Mac incoming Big Mac out going to end and out s three. In and out.\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"Some of the internal service is measured on news devices. It's kind of agnostic to where the traffic\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"came from. Transit our house or from a different data. Easy into this ese on. Then finally, the edge\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"devices each pop. Yes, it's still true. Each pop has his own. You drop Attn. Least today in today's\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"pop say, 11. He and Trap, which is the single ingress points to pop. And so on this device, you can\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"measure all of the service's traffic coming in and out. So we have has it out for Deena's girlfriend\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"service Internal three. This is a really that slow, but we also have broader mitigation. Final\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"Counter Uh, which is not then for basically, is a way of us to for us to figure out what Roger\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"medications are doing, which are kind of future. It was every single age transit devices, intra.\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"Yes, exactly. And there's going to be new pops classic pops or rising 15 pops China Pops, which have\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"any intra we have embedded Pops is in there. So it's coming out with these embedded pops, which are\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"not gonna have designated the in trust. And so it's kind of I don't know what the current stands in.\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"The last I talked with Rich this team. It's kind of figuring out how we can do that provide the same\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"level of visibility, and these embedded sites doesn't need any tracks. Okay, a good challenge for\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"guys. The other rather type is E T Edge. Yes, that Is that okay? Yeah. Every region have all three\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"of these devices on. So, regions like, you know, B s regions corresponded with border acts. So every\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"reason we'll have border acts, okay, Because those are kind of like a correspondent. Like the\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"availability zones. Okay, Transit border trust are actually not reasons As you think of them.\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"They're actually the correspondent the transit centers that we have. Okay. And so these don't like.\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"I think it's safe to say that every AWS region will have correspondent here trust, but there are\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"also being atrocities that are in different transit locations that don't have a designated region.\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"So, like you W r, for example, I don't think that's a region and like the ones in L. A X, which is\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"another region, and it's kind of anywhere that we have these transit centers on dhe Those transit\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"centers are also where black watch lives as well. So it's there's some association with invest\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"regions, but it's not that tightly coupled and then edge devices. There's one of these per pop,\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"which is totally region. It's okay. Every pope without one India Yes, on them. So the two things I\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"want to call up for, like canary validation on enough low stacks. We have this thing called and look\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"out. Help monitor, which we have one for region and it basically just. And then it's fate. Take not\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"flow to one of the undersea house, so you don't drop. But before that what? It's come to my vision.\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"Um, so basically, how do we know what this our nephew Stack is alive and working properly, So we\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"have lots of alarms, but these are like two things that are like sanity. Health checks like it's\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"working properly. Net flow was able to go from one end to the other. Eso look at health monitor is\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"the admits fake net flow in the same way that actual net flow comes in amidst the same port and\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"expects that the Net flow collector will read it to disk or in Harlem, the activation stack put in\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"R. D s and on the other end that look out service will be able to provide data, Uh, for that fake\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"nephew traffic. Um, Then the other validation that we do and so look at the monitor is like her\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"region, but basically a sandy check on like I ate enough low stack is alive. Then we have router\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"info, which is a special look out customer that for every Browder's traffic, we admitted to all the\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"different Robin surfaces, like easy to incoming. It's too outgoing, whatever. But then we also\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"admitted to Reverend Go, which is basically just a corresponds with every ne flow. Custer And the\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"purpose of this is include some diagnostic information. We can take a look at it. Me, You. I so\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"nothing missing. It is a useful place to start your investigation on wife missing. And it's also\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"where we put our low stops and alarms for these net flow customers. Because if a router is receiving\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"traffic and we're not receiving enough Oh, for that, then it's a problem. So we alarm on that\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"commission. Uh, so the metric basically just shows like this runner is not flow is being received by\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"this and of sea, and, um, at least at that level, things are working properly. Is this operation\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"actually walking? Because I I may be incorrect. But then I saw a couple of tickets will lose upset\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"alarms. Where did the waste was taken for soldiers? Shouldn't that be suppressed by this\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"documentary? That s o. The interesting thing about the low SNP suppression is so in terms of us\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"MMPI, there's three conditions. SNP is working and there's high traffic. SNP is working and there's\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"low traffic. And S and P is not working In the case of SNP is not working, we don't suppress. Okay,\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"So could there be any other reasons apart from the device being out of service? Why, yes, And he's\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"not looking for is that the only reason why it s gonna be won't work sometimes S and P is not\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"working for other reasons.

[][9]\\\\nWe built Tenor Render Cache (RC) as a managed and opaque store enabling renderscripts fast access to supplemental rendering datasets during creative serve time. While this feature provides extensive flexibility for renderscript owners to innovate on new creative experiences, we do not want you to perceive Render Cache as a panacea to all your caching use-cases. Before getting started, please review your use-case with us through [Office Hours][10] to understand if Render Cache is a good fit for the problem you are trying to solve. Sample use-cases:\\\\n|**Use-case**|**Good Fit?**|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|Display aggregated discounts/offers across all ASIN's in a Landing Store page|✅|\\\\n|Display interactivity elements on creatives|✅|\\\\n|Store advertiser-provided creative properties|❌|\\\\n|Store bid/auction context|❌|\\\\n|Store personalized datasets against customer's PII|❌|\\\\n\\\\n## Getting Started [][11]\\\\n[Learn more about Tenor][2] and its components/capabilities to understand if it can help you address your creative rendering needs. When ready to onboard, [file a onboarding request][12] with us.\\\\n## Pre-requisites [][13]\\\\n1. Your use-case and system design involving Tenor's Render Cache is reviewed and approved by us.\\\\n2. As a data provider, you acknowledge that you are operationally responsible for the data accuracy and its availability.\\\\n3. As a data provider, you acknowledge that your data handling on Tenor complies with Amazon's InfoSec policies.\\\\n## Cache Namespace [][14]\\\\nAs part of the onboarding, we will configure a new _Cache Namespace_ on Tenor’s Render Cache. This Cache Namespace is a unique identifier that is always part of the final/internal cache look-up keys and avoids potential key collisions through a logical separation amongst tenants. Currently, Tenor's Render Cache fleet is a single AWS Elasticache instance supporting multiple tenants, and therefore we do not have concepts of dedicated cache fleets, reserved memory capacity, etc. for a given Cache Namespace. This setup is intentional to keep things simple and revisit when appropriate for use-cases requiring dedicated cache fleets.\\\\n> \\\\n> **Note:**\\\\n> Choose the name of your Cache Namespace wisely. Changing the name of your Cache Namespace once onboarded would need to be treated as new onboarding and requires rework. We recommend you to name your Cache Namespace that closely describes the datasets it contains so that it remains re-usable across other renderscripts if need be.\\\\n> \\\\n> ## Cache Data Model [][15]\\\\nTenor treats Render Cache entries as opaque values with no additional processing, and primarily acts as a pass-through data-provider to renderscripts. Under the hood, Tenor uses AWS ElastiCache for Redis (6.0 - as of Sept 2024) as its cache store. Based on this underlying technology, we recommend you to design your cache data model that optimizes towards low-latency high-throughput cache look-ups. Below are the key considerations to take into account while designing your cache data model.\\\\n> \\\\n> **Note:**\\\\n> Tenor does not support multiple cache calls due to latency restrictions. If your use-case requires multi-key look-ups, consider modelling your data as\\\\n> [Redis Hashes][16]\\\\n> instead.\\\\n> \\\\n> ### Cache look-ups [][17]\\\\nTenor provides federated mechanism for renderscripts to implement the Render Cache key generation logic decoupled from Tenor code base. Follow our [federation guide][18] on how to return the Render Cache keys from your renderscripts for Tenor to look-up against your Cache Namespace.\\\\n### Cardinality [][19]\\\\nIf your datasets are of low-cardinality and experience very high cache look-up's, this might lead to hot-key issues at higher TPS and cause availability drops. To address this, Tenor has introduced an in-memory L1 cache that can be configured per Cache Namespace. Please consult with us if your namespace contains low-cardinality datasets to determine if it warrants the need for in-memory L1 cache.\\\\n## Cache Publish [][20]\\\\nAs a data provider, we expect you to build and own a publisher component that can ensure Render Cache namespace remains populated with your most up-to-date datasets. For publishing, Tenor provides 2 options:\\\\n1. If your use-case requires that only newer versions are persisted, with writes with older-versions to be ignored, then you should configure your Cache Namespace to be **VERSIONED**. For such VERSIONED Cache Namespaces, your publisher is expected to provide a numeric `version` in the Tenor CacheWarmer Publish API input. Tenor assumes the record with numerically highest `version` to be the latest version and applies preventive mechanisms to avoid overwriting the existing data with older versions.\\\\n2. If your use-case requires the ability to always overwrite the data, then configure your Cache Namespace to be **NON-VERSIONED**. Tenor would simply update any existing cache record with the provided data. This means, you as a data provider would be responsible to keep the Render Cache populated with the latest and most accurate data sets. Any `version` value passed in the Tenor CacheWarmer Publish API input would be ignored.\\\\n> \\\\n> **Note:**\\\\n> Configuring your namespace as VERSIONED vs. NON-VERSIONED is a one-way door decision. Please review your choice carefully and consult with us as needed.\\\\n> \\\\n> > \\\\n> **Note:**\\\\n> While Tenor serves rendering traffic in NA:IAD (Cell1, Cell2), NA:PDX, EU:DUB, EU:ZAZ, EU:FRA, FE:PDX and FE:SIN regions, you are expected to spin your Cache Publisher stacks such that they publish only to Tenor CacheWarmer in NA:IAD (Cell1), EU:DUB, EU:ZAZ, EU:FRA and FE:PDX. Tenor CacheWarmer would internally replicate your datasets to other (i.e. NA:PDX and FE:SIN) regions.\\\\n> \\\\n> ## Cache Look-up Failures [][21]\\\\nSince Tenor treats your Render Cache data as opaque, the default behavior on any _Render Cache Look-up Failure_ is to ignore and continue with the renderscript execution. As a Cache Namespace owner, you can override this default rendering behavior that suites your use-case.\\\\n### Failure Types [][22]\\\\nBelow are the typical _Failure Types_ that occurs when Tenor looks-up the Render Cache for your cache keys:\\\\n1. **Cache Miss \\\\\\\\(`GC\\\\\\\\_CACHE\\\\\\\\_MISS`\\\\\\\\):** Indicates there is no value found for your cache keys.\\\\n2. **Cache Version Mismatch \\\\\\\\(`GC\\\\\\\\_VERSION\\\\\\\\_MISMATCH`\\\\\\\\):** Applicable only for VERSIONED Cache Namespaces. Indicates there is a mismatch between the requested version and the persisted version retrieved from the Render Cache.\\\\n### Render Actions [][23]\\\\nFor each of the above Failure Types, you can optionally configure either of the below _Render Actions_ for Tenor to take on the given render request on behalf of your renderscript:\\\\n1. **`IGNORE`:** Default behavior. Tenor simply ignores the cache look-up failure and continues with the renderscript execution with empty Render Cache values.\\\\n2. **`ERROR\\\\\\\\_OUT`:** Immediately fails the render request with the corresponding reason, surfacing as availability drop.\\\\n3. **`COLLAPSE`:** Short circuits the render call and sends an empty HTML response. \\\\\\\\(_No longer supported_\\\\\\\\)\\\\n> \\\\n> **Note:**\\\\n> If Render Cache misses translate to availability drop (i.e. creatives not served), it indicates your use-case has a hard dependency on the Render Cache data set.

Remember the good old lookout days where we had a pager number engineer to change\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"these things. So I think this might be my last slide. So the devices we monitor, there's three types\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"that we monitor today is kind of ever changing list. I would bet the next year you guys from project\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"to do additional writers. But today we have these border transit layer devices, those beer trotters\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"and the P R F P C routers, which this is like a new network fabric called Spinal Cap. Super\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"important. But basically these the border transit routers are the ones between our border and\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"transit providers. So they're kind of aggressive. Okay, with your side, they're kind of the ingress\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"points to the Amazon border edge of the Amazon. And so the customers here bordering Coming porter\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"outgoing supporter, incoming is traditional in what we use for most of our Adidas detection, because\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"that's really gives a really broad picture club from Metro net flow. Also, how many devices the\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"border Agler devices are eternal routers that are kind of a next lawyer down in the east to network.\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"Uh, so these are things like Big Mac incoming Big Mac out going to end and out s three. In and out.\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"Some of the internal service is measured on news devices. It's kind of agnostic to where the traffic\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"came from. Transit our house or from a different data. Easy into this ese on. Then finally, the edge\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"devices each pop. Yes, it's still true. Each pop has his own. You drop Attn. Least today in today's\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"pop say, 11. He and Trap, which is the single ingress points to pop. And so on this device, you can\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"measure all of the service's traffic coming in and out. So we have has it out for Deena's girlfriend\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"service Internal three. This is a really that slow, but we also have broader mitigation. Final\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"Counter Uh, which is not then for basically, is a way of us to for us to figure out what Roger\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"medications are doing, which are kind of future. It was every single age transit devices, intra.\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"Yes, exactly. And there's going to be new pops classic pops or rising 15 pops China Pops, which have\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"any intra we have embedded Pops is in there. So it's coming out with these embedded pops, which are\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"not gonna have designated the in trust. And so it's kind of I don't know what the current stands in.\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"The last I talked with Rich this team. It's kind of figuring out how we can do that provide the same\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"level of visibility, and these embedded sites doesn't need any tracks. Okay, a good challenge for\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"guys. The other rather type is E T Edge. Yes, that Is that okay? Yeah. Every region have all three\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"of these devices on. So, regions like, you know, B s regions corresponded with border acts. So every\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"reason we'll have border acts, okay, Because those are kind of like a correspondent. Like the\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"availability zones. Okay, Transit border trust are actually not reasons As you think of them.\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"They're actually the correspondent the transit centers that we have. Okay. And so these don't like.\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"I think it's safe to say that every AWS region will have correspondent here trust, but there are\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"also being atrocities that are in different transit locations that don't have a designated region.\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"So, like you W r, for example, I don't think that's a region and like the ones in L. A X, which is\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"another region, and it's kind of anywhere that we have these transit centers on dhe Those transit\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"centers are also where black watch lives as well. So it's there's some association with invest\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"regions, but it's not that tightly coupled and then edge devices. There's one of these per pop,\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"which is totally region. It's okay. Every pope without one India Yes, on them. So the two things I\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"want to call up for, like canary validation on enough low stacks. We have this thing called and look\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"out. Help monitor, which we have one for region and it basically just. And then it's fate. Take not\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"flow to one of the undersea house, so you don't drop. But before that what? It's come to my vision.\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"Um, so basically, how do we know what this our nephew Stack is alive and working properly, So we\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"have lots of alarms, but these are like two things that are like sanity. Health checks like it's\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"working properly. Net flow was able to go from one end to the other. Eso look at health monitor is\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"the admits fake net flow in the same way that actual net flow comes in amidst the same port and\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"expects that the Net flow collector will read it to disk or in Harlem, the activation stack put in\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"R. D s and on the other end that look out service will be able to provide data, Uh, for that fake\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"nephew traffic. Um, Then the other validation that we do and so look at the monitor is like her\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"region, but basically a sandy check on like I ate enough low stack is alive. Then we have router\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"info, which is a special look out customer that for every Browder's traffic, we admitted to all the\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"different Robin surfaces, like easy to incoming. It's too outgoing, whatever. But then we also\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"admitted to Reverend Go, which is basically just a corresponds with every ne flow. Custer And the\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"purpose of this is include some diagnostic information. We can take a look at it. Me, You. I so\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"nothing missing. It is a useful place to start your investigation on wife missing. And it's also\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"where we put our low stops and alarms for these net flow customers. Because if a router is receiving\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"traffic and we're not receiving enough Oh, for that, then it's a problem. So we alarm on that\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"commission. Uh, so the metric basically just shows like this runner is not flow is being received by\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"this and of sea, and, um, at least at that level, things are working properly. Is this operation\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"actually walking? Because I I may be incorrect. But then I saw a couple of tickets will lose upset\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"alarms. Where did the waste was taken for soldiers? Shouldn't that be suppressed by this\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"documentary? That s o. The interesting thing about the low SNP suppression is so in terms of us\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"MMPI, there's three conditions. SNP is working and there's high traffic. SNP is working and there's\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"low traffic. And S and P is not working In the case of SNP is not working, we don't suppress. Okay,\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"So could there be any other reasons apart from the device being out of service? Why, yes, And he's\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"not looking for is that the only reason why it s gonna be won't work sometimes S and P is not\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"working for other reasons.

[][9]\\\\nWe built Tenor Render Cache (RC) as a managed and opaque store enabling renderscripts fast access to supplemental rendering datasets during creative serve time. While this feature provides extensive flexibility for renderscript owners to innovate on new creative experiences, we do not want you to perceive Render Cache as a panacea to all your caching use-cases. Before getting started, please review your use-case with us through [Office Hours][10] to understand if Render Cache is a good fit for the problem you are trying to solve. Sample use-cases:\\\\n|**Use-case**|**Good Fit?**|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|Display aggregated discounts/offers across all ASIN's in a Landing Store page|✅|\\\\n|Display interactivity elements on creatives|✅|\\\\n|Store advertiser-provided creative properties|❌|\\\\n|Store bid/auction context|❌|\\\\n|Store personalized datasets against customer's PII|❌|\\\\n\\\\n## Getting Started [][11]\\\\n[Learn more about Tenor][2] and its components/capabilities to understand if it can help you address your creative rendering needs. When ready to onboard, [file a onboarding request][12] with us.\\\\n## Pre-requisites [][13]\\\\n1. Your use-case and system design involving Tenor's Render Cache is reviewed and approved by us.\\\\n2. As a data provider, you acknowledge that you are operationally responsible for the data accuracy and its availability.\\\\n3. As a data provider, you acknowledge that your data handling on Tenor complies with Amazon's InfoSec policies.\\\\n## Cache Namespace [][14]\\\\nAs part of the onboarding, we will configure a new _Cache Namespace_ on Tenor’s Render Cache. This Cache Namespace is a unique identifier that is always part of the final/internal cache look-up keys and avoids potential key collisions through a logical separation amongst tenants. Currently, Tenor's Render Cache fleet is a single AWS Elasticache instance supporting multiple tenants, and therefore we do not have concepts of dedicated cache fleets, reserved memory capacity, etc. for a given Cache Namespace. This setup is intentional to keep things simple and revisit when appropriate for use-cases requiring dedicated cache fleets.\\\\n> \\\\n> **Note:**\\\\n> Choose the name of your Cache Namespace wisely. Changing the name of your Cache Namespace once onboarded would need to be treated as new onboarding and requires rework. We recommend you to name your Cache Namespace that closely describes the datasets it contains so that it remains re-usable across other renderscripts if need be.\\\\n> \\\\n> ## Cache Data Model [][15]\\\\nTenor treats Render Cache entries as opaque values with no additional processing, and primarily acts as a pass-through data-provider to renderscripts. Under the hood, Tenor uses AWS ElastiCache for Redis (6.0 - as of Sept 2024) as its cache store. Based on this underlying technology, we recommend you to design your cache data model that optimizes towards low-latency high-throughput cache look-ups. Below are the key considerations to take into account while designing your cache data model.\\\\n> \\\\n> **Note:**\\\\n> Tenor does not support multiple cache calls due to latency restrictions. If your use-case requires multi-key look-ups, consider modelling your data as\\\\n> [Redis Hashes][16]\\\\n> instead.\\\\n> \\\\n> ### Cache look-ups [][17]\\\\nTenor provides federated mechanism for renderscripts to implement the Render Cache key generation logic decoupled from Tenor code base. Follow our [federation guide][18] on how to return the Render Cache keys from your renderscripts for Tenor to look-up against your Cache Namespace.\\\\n### Cardinality [][19]\\\\nIf your datasets are of low-cardinality and experience very high cache look-up's, this might lead to hot-key issues at higher TPS and cause availability drops. To address this, Tenor has introduced an in-memory L1 cache that can be configured per Cache Namespace. Please consult with us if your namespace contains low-cardinality datasets to determine if it warrants the need for in-memory L1 cache.\\\\n## Cache Publish [][20]\\\\nAs a data provider, we expect you to build and own a publisher component that can ensure Render Cache namespace remains populated with your most up-to-date datasets. For publishing, Tenor provides 2 options:\\\\n1. If your use-case requires that only newer versions are persisted, with writes with older-versions to be ignored, then you should configure your Cache Namespace to be **VERSIONED**. For such VERSIONED Cache Namespaces, your publisher is expected to provide a numeric `version` in the Tenor CacheWarmer Publish API input. Tenor assumes the record with numerically highest `version` to be the latest version and applies preventive mechanisms to avoid overwriting the existing data with older versions.\\\\n2. If your use-case requires the ability to always overwrite the data, then configure your Cache Namespace to be **NON-VERSIONED**. Tenor would simply update any existing cache record with the provided data. This means, you as a data provider would be responsible to keep the Render Cache populated with the latest and most accurate data sets. Any `version` value passed in the Tenor CacheWarmer Publish API input would be ignored.\\\\n> \\\\n> **Note:**\\\\n> Configuring your namespace as VERSIONED vs. NON-VERSIONED is a one-way door decision. Please review your choice carefully and consult with us as needed.\\\\n> \\\\n> > \\\\n> **Note:**\\\\n> While Tenor serves rendering traffic in NA:IAD (Cell1, Cell2), NA:PDX, EU:DUB, EU:ZAZ, EU:FRA, FE:PDX and FE:SIN regions, you are expected to spin your Cache Publisher stacks such that they publish only to Tenor CacheWarmer in NA:IAD (Cell1), EU:DUB, EU:ZAZ, EU:FRA and FE:PDX. Tenor CacheWarmer would internally replicate your datasets to other (i.e. NA:PDX and FE:SIN) regions.\\\\n> \\\\n> ## Cache Look-up Failures [][21]\\\\nSince Tenor treats your Render Cache data as opaque, the default behavior on any _Render Cache Look-up Failure_ is to ignore and continue with the renderscript execution. As a Cache Namespace owner, you can override this default rendering behavior that suites your use-case.\\\\n### Failure Types [][22]\\\\nBelow are the typical _Failure Types_ that occurs when Tenor looks-up the Render Cache for your cache keys:\\\\n1. **Cache Miss \\\\\\\\(`GC\\\\\\\\_CACHE\\\\\\\\_MISS`\\\\\\\\):** Indicates there is no value found for your cache keys.\\\\n2. **Cache Version Mismatch \\\\\\\\(`GC\\\\\\\\_VERSION\\\\\\\\_MISMATCH`\\\\\\\\):** Applicable only for VERSIONED Cache Namespaces. Indicates there is a mismatch between the requested version and the persisted version retrieved from the Render Cache.\\\\n### Render Actions [][23]\\\\nFor each of the above Failure Types, you can optionally configure either of the below _Render Actions_ for Tenor to take on the given render request on behalf of your renderscript:\\\\n1. **`IGNORE`:** Default behavior. Tenor simply ignores the cache look-up failure and continues with the renderscript execution with empty Render Cache values.\\\\n2. **`ERROR\\\\\\\\_OUT`:** Immediately fails the render request with the corresponding reason, surfacing as availability drop.\\\\n3. **`COLLAPSE`:** Short circuits the render call and sends an empty HTML response. \\\\\\\\(_No longer supported_\\\\\\\\)\\\\n> \\\\n> **Note:**\\\\n> If Render Cache misses translate to availability drop (i.e. creatives not served), it indicates your use-case has a hard dependency on the Render Cache data set. We do not support such use-cases and instead expect your renderscript to gracefully handle serving creatives (ex: fallback to serving degraded creative experience, serve static creatives, etc.) when no Render Cache data is available.\\\\n> \\\\n> ### Notifications [][24]\\\\nIn addition to the Render Actions, you can optionally configure Tenor to publish _Notifications_ to our SNS topics on Cache Look-up Failures against your Cache Namespace. By subscribing to these notifications, you can implement mechanisms that enable your cache publisher to backfill/update the Render Cache entries within your Cache Namespace. To subscribe to these notifications, please provide your applications' AWS account ID(s) for us grant appropriate permissions for you to subscribe to our SNS topics.\\\\nHosted on [Evergreen][25].\\\\n[1]: /tenor-hub/assets/img/evergreen-512.png\\\\n[2]: /tenor-hub/.\\\\n[3]: /tenor-hub/architecture/overview\\\\n[4]: /tenor-hub/info/troubleshoot\\\\n[5]: /tenor-hub/onboarding/renderscript\\\\n[6]: /tenor-hub/onboarding/render-cache\\\\n[7]: https://code.amazon.com/packages/D16GTenorEvergreenDockitContent/blobs/mainline/--/src/onboarding/render-cache.md/edit_file_online\\\\n[8]: #render-cache-onboarding\\\\n[9]: #when-should-i-use-render-cache\\\\n[10]: https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/DCOR/Support/Office%20Hours/\\\\n[11]: #getting-started\\\\n[12]: https://issues.amazon.com/issues/create?template=238173f2-d1c7-486d-9f66-7d52d1ddc7bf\\\\n[13]: #pre-requisites\\\\n[14]: #cache-namespace\\\\n[15]: #cache-data-model\\\\n[16]: https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/hashes/\\\\n[17]: #cache-look-ups\\\\n[18]: https://quip-amazon.com/xHuMAUwbDNbl/Tenor-Template-Federation-Onboarding-Guide\\\\n[19]: #cardinality\\\\n[20]: #cache-publish\\\\n[21]: #cache-look-up-failures\\\\n[22]: #failure-types\\\\n[23]: #render-actions\\\\n[24]: #notifications\\\\n[25]: https://evergreen.corp.amazon.com\\\"\"}],\"totalResults\":1998154,\"currentPage\":null}}"}]}

Non-checkout services migrated.|-\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Client Expectations ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe move out of DUB will have many parallel service migrations occurring simultaneously and will necessitate that teams maintain their service obligations to their clients. The services that provide endpoints to clients outside payments are key to realizing this strategy. SDO will be moving in an asynchronous and decoupled way, for example a client of PayStation migrates before PayStation is serving locally in that region. Clients will have a seamless access service endpoints with access to all data that would have previously only been stored in DUB. The new regions, FRA and ZAZ, are not “siloed regions” in the same way that DUB, IAD, or PDX are currently for data isolation or regulatory separation. The aggregation of DUB, ZAZ, and FRA are siblings in a single domain for the purposes of data sharing and access. Clients of Payments must be able to use any regional endpoint to access their data without making client changes. We will optimise for latency neutral calls for data local to that region to facilitate data partitioning across regions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== \\\\*\\\\*Guiding Principles\\\\*\\\\* ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have defined a set of guiding principles all services owners should adhere to. This standardization will ensure that we can augment teams, with minimal ramp up time and accelerate service migrations to meet the milestone dates.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Service Migration Guide is the baseline standard for how to move a service.\\\\*\\\\* This \\\\[\\\\[guide>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Tech\\\\_Guidance/Per-Service\\\\_Region\\\\_Migration\\\\_Guide/\\\\]\\\\] provides the typical steps for migrating a service. For services operating concurrently, we provide specific guidance on compute and data migration.\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Decouple the compute, storage, and configuration migration.\\\\*\\\\* Prioritize migrating compute first as this allows a gradual transition and represents the majority of the reduction goal. This also provides opportunities to stop when the P0 metrics have been achieved and focus on optimizations to improve other metrics like IMR.\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Hub and spoke model for data.\\\\*\\\\* A service will only store authoritative data in a single location \\\\(the hub\\\\), and the service in another region \\\\(the spoke\\\\) will access to data inter region or from a local cache. This will be done when the customer perceived P0 metric can be achieved without full replication. This reduces code changes and the complexity of services that handle transactional data or strongly consistent data. \\\\_\\\\_We will publish a data strategy for the initial state, how data will be migrated and the long term state.\\\\_\\\\_\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*No new service launches or traffic dial up in DUB.\\\\*\\\\* We must not increase our server usage in DUB from 2025. The server reduction goals are contingent on zero expansion of service out-of-scope for migration in 2025. Teams must launch or dial-up in ZAZ and FRA \\\\(if required\\\\) only. \\\\_\\\\_We are working on an exception process that teams can follow.\\\\_\\\\_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Technical Strategy ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have devised the technical strategy to enable DARU migration for any payments service by categorizing the set of tasks across key five areas -\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n=== \\\\(1\\\\) Ensure Service is Region Flexible ===\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe overall aim is to ensure the traffic a service operates on, is decoupled from the region in which it is running.

Examples of the experiments used by other experiences are:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Utilizing a Weblab or other frameworks to run a pre-migration experiment to inject latency where cross region calls will be present.

Non-checkout services migrated.|-\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Client Expectations ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe move out of DUB will have many parallel service migrations occurring simultaneously and will necessitate that teams maintain their service obligations to their clients. The services that provide endpoints to clients outside payments are key to realizing this strategy. SDO will be moving in an asynchronous and decoupled way, for example a client of PayStation migrates before PayStation is serving locally in that region. Clients will have a seamless access service endpoints with access to all data that would have previously only been stored in DUB. The new regions, FRA and ZAZ, are not “siloed regions” in the same way that DUB, IAD, or PDX are currently for data isolation or regulatory separation. The aggregation of DUB, ZAZ, and FRA are siblings in a single domain for the purposes of data sharing and access. Clients of Payments must be able to use any regional endpoint to access their data without making client changes. We will optimise for latency neutral calls for data local to that region to facilitate data partitioning across regions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== \\\\*\\\\*Guiding Principles\\\\*\\\\* ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have defined a set of guiding principles all services owners should adhere to. This standardization will ensure that we can augment teams, with minimal ramp up time and accelerate service migrations to meet the milestone dates.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Service Migration Guide is the baseline standard for how to move a service.\\\\*\\\\* This \\\\[\\\\[guide>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Tech\\\\_Guidance/Per-Service\\\\_Region\\\\_Migration\\\\_Guide/\\\\]\\\\] provides the typical steps for migrating a service. For services operating concurrently, we provide specific guidance on compute and data migration.\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Decouple the compute, storage, and configuration migration.\\\\*\\\\* Prioritize migrating compute first as this allows a gradual transition and represents the majority of the reduction goal. This also provides opportunities to stop when the P0 metrics have been achieved and focus on optimizations to improve other metrics like IMR.\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Hub and spoke model for data.\\\\*\\\\* A service will only store authoritative data in a single location \\\\(the hub\\\\), and the service in another region \\\\(the spoke\\\\) will access to data inter region or from a local cache. This will be done when the customer perceived P0 metric can be achieved without full replication. This reduces code changes and the complexity of services that handle transactional data or strongly consistent data. \\\\_\\\\_We will publish a data strategy for the initial state, how data will be migrated and the long term state.\\\\_\\\\_\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*No new service launches or traffic dial up in DUB.\\\\*\\\\* We must not increase our server usage in DUB from 2025. The server reduction goals are contingent on zero expansion of service out-of-scope for migration in 2025. Teams must launch or dial-up in ZAZ and FRA \\\\(if required\\\\) only. \\\\_\\\\_We are working on an exception process that teams can follow.\\\\_\\\\_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Technical Strategy ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have devised the technical strategy to enable DARU migration for any payments service by categorizing the set of tasks across key five areas -\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n=== \\\\(1\\\\) Ensure Service is Region Flexible ===\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe overall aim is to ensure the traffic a service operates on, is decoupled from the region in which it is running.

The Region Flexibility team \\\\(RFE\\\\) provides solutions, architectural patterns and tooling to help service owners get into regions quickly. This document outlines the IdentityService’s Region Flexibility strategy based on our architectural peculiarities.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Region Flexibility Requirements\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAWS currently offers 31 geographically dispersed and fault-isolated regions. However, SDO organization and IdentityServices primarily use only four of them: IAD \\\\(NA / us-east-1\\\\), DUB \\\\(EU / eu-west-1\\\\), PDX \\\\(FE / us-west-2\\\\), and PEK \\\\(CN / cn-north-1\\\\). RFE identifies these regions as “mega-regions”. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe existing mega-regions are approaching their physical capacity limits. To avoid future bottlenecks, the organization must turn off services or migrate them to other regions. This has resulted in the following requirements:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nExit DUB: Due to DUB constraints, SDO organization must exit the DUB region by 2026 to enable SDO exit from DUB by the end of 2026.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nExpand to additional regions: To avoid building another mega-region, the organization must make it easy to expand to multiple regions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor simplicity, this document uses the replacement region \\\\\\\\\\\"ZAZ\\\\\\\\\\\" for the region \\\\\\\\\\\"DUB\\\\\\\\\\\". However, this strategy is extensible to the \\\\\\\\\\\"FRA\\\\\\\\\\\" region and other upcoming regions as they evolve. As per the discussion with the Regional Flexibility organization, we will treat the \\\\\\\\\\\"FRA\\\\\\\\\\\" region as a first-class citizen.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. Existing Posture\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe own over 50 applications, spanning backend services, frontend services, UI application, and mobile components. Most of these are in Tier-1 critical path. Our applications are primarily in the MAWS, with few new ones in the NAWS environment. On the compute side, we have presence on EC2, Lambda, HEX/AWS, and other services. For Storage, we use both AWS DynamoDB and the Sable service. For data security, we use AWS KMS, KeyMaster, and FieldGuard. We also have multiple Tier-2 components around events, data warehouse integration, and other functionality.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOur data is primarily keyed on Customers which can include Buyers, Sellers, Vendors, Flex Drivers, Amazon Business customers, and more. We also support Customer Profiles. We also own the PARIS, which stores merchant and marketplace data. We also have generic identifier agnostic authorization services.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMost of our services provide a global view of data by using either global replication or the Customer Homing feature.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n3. Tenets \\\\(unless you know better ones\\\\)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBuild Region Flexibility Capability: The solution must enable region flexibility capability to swiftly extend additional regions for our applications.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSecurity: The solution must not compromise the security posture of our data.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMinimize client changes: Avoid requiring clients to update beyond merging from the live environment, as this will slows us down.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMinimize impact: Beyond concerns about cross-region latency and cross-region network availability concerns, mitigate every other impact due to the solution. In general, attempt to optimize for latency as well. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBuild for scale; Our solution must support scale on transaction volume as well as for the number of services and applications.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nLeverage central tools, influence where possible: Region Flexibility is an SDO-wide problem and therefore requires generalized solutions. We will leverage centralized solution when available and, extend help to central team to build build/update the central solution as relevant and should avoid building solutions that should be better built by a central team. However, our primary focus will be towards building solutions for Identity’s peculiarities that no one else will invest into.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nReduce overall operations: Design with operations in mind. Build tools or automate as relevant, decommission if possible. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n4. Core Decisions\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe define our Region Flexibility approach based on the following core decisions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNew Region as Siblings: While all extensions in the EU region \\\\(e.g. ZAZ, FRA, HYD, etc\\\\) must provide functionally equivalent results as the DUB region, we’ll strictly model new regions as siblings rather than children of the EU region \\\\(Ref: Realm Choices\\\\). This will ensure that our configuration is split out upfront and follows more explicit intent than automatic derivation due to the hierarchy. This will also avoid future surprises. There might be common configuration across multiple regions in the EU. We’ll model that explicitly than deriving it from the child hierarchy. This aligns with RFE team's recommendation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nDecouple Compute and Storage Migration: We’ll move application servers to the ZAZ region ahead of migrating data to ZAZ. This will ensure stepwise progress and a seamless transition.

This will require a few key changes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Expand to additional regions. \\\\*\\\\*Get into more regions! De-concentrate out of our primary AWS regions today - DUB, IAD, and PDX - in order to grow and scale despite challenges such as physical limitations, changes in compliance legislation, and to reduce the blast radius of outages. It's been over a decade since SDO as a whole has gotten into new regions, and we'll need to re-learn what it takes.\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Support additional latency where it's appropriate and frugal. \\\\*\\\\*Enable SDO to leverage additional availability zones \\\\(AZs\\\\) and regions that are more distant than our services expect today. We'll drive experiments to assess and moderate the impact of both intra-service and inter-service latency, and leverage in-development service and data  graphs to identify where minimal latency can be introduced into the service graph.\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Make multi-region marketplaces possible \\\\(splitting .com\\\\). \\\\*\\\\*Enable a single marketplace to be served across multiple regions in the steady state. We'll need this approach for our largest marketplaces, such as the US, where one region can't sustain us forever, and when smaller marketplaces pass localization legislation. By splitting use cases or customers across AWS regions, we can improve our ability to mitigate region-specific capacity constraints.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Grand Vision ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nServices and data are automatically placed in the region\\\\(s\\\\) and AZ\\\\(s\\\\) they’re needed without builder effort or awareness, and guardrails ensure all new services stay region flexible from creation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== What can I move now? ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAWS region in ZAZ is open for use in SDO.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAWS region in FRA reached the \\\\*\\\\*General Availability\\\\*\\\\* milestone as of December 30 2024.

To get started please review SDO's \\\\[\\\\[Exit DUB Strategy>>https://wiki.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Tech\\\\_Guidance/Deep\\\\_Dives\\\\_and\\\\_Announcements/Announcements/Exit\\\\_DUB\\\\_Strategy/\\\\]\\\\] and \\\\[\\\\[Sub-experience Migration Coordination>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Coordinating\\\\_Migrations/\\\\]\\\\] wikis. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Vision ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe envision a future where latency-sensitive workloads operate in the region closest to our customers, and latency-insensitive workloads operate in the least expensive region that meets regulatory requirements. In this future, most services are agnostic of where their business logic and data reside, and only provide constraints and scaling signals to a central placement system solving for the Amazon-wide optimal solution balancing capacity availability signals from AWS, the optimal customer experience, regulatory compliance, and cost efficiency. With greater flexibility, peak events that require scaling beyond the available capacity of a single region can be served simultaneously from multiple regions, reducing our peak-to-mean spread and reducing CAPEX. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo accomplish this, we need to intentionally iterate on architectures that abstract networking and infrastructure management \\\\(e.g., moving to higher-level abstractions\\\\), reduce the number of architectural patterns SDO teams employ to build their services, improve the abstraction of telemetry and observability capabilities, and centralize the optimization of undifferentiated decisions currently made imperfectly due to distributed ownership \\\\(e.g., placement of capacity, timeout management, data migrations\\\\). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe begin by building core components that enable and reduce the effort of our most urgent cross-region moves, while guiding individual teams to adopt solutions and foundational systems that meet them at their current architectural abstraction and maturity \\\\(e.g., provide solutions for each of Lambda, managed runtimes, and JVM-on-EC2/ECS\\\\). We then intentionally build on the learnings from cross-region migrations into these central solutions and patterns, evolving SDO services with minimum builder toil \\\\(e.g., ship features via merge-from-live\\\\). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLearn more at our \\\\[\\\\[definition of a region flexible service>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Tech\\\\_Guidance/Deep\\\\_Dives\\\\_and\\\\_Announcements/Definition\\\\_of\\\\_a\\\\_Region\\\\_Flexible\\\\_Service/\\\\]\\\\].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Tenets \\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"font-size:22px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\(//Unless you know better...\\\\)//\\\\(%%\\\\) ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n//\\\\*\\\\*Region Flexibility \\\\(Updated August, 2023\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*//\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

Solution uniformity is a strategy, not a goal, no one solution will fit all; however customizations and bespoke solutions are expensive in the long term.\\\\\\\\n1. We prefer to provide precision in our shepherding of teams and migrations, employing central visibility, data, and tooling; but accept that our guidance must be sufficient where ambiguity exists.\\\\\\\\n1.

We own the vision for how SDO gets into new regions, and influence which regions we move into considering regulatory requirements, latency, cost efficiency, and developer experience. You can review solutions that we are developing under \\\\\\\\\\\"Accelerators\\\\\\\\\\\" section.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== How does Region Flexibility impact me as a service owner? ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nToday, most of the work to get into new regions is on service owners. While the Region Flexibility team's goal is to eventually automate this work, we have a long way to go, and we expect our first region expansion/migration programs will be the most manual. Service owners are expected to set up their services in new region and then migrate their data and traffic, potentially in coordination with other teams. Our best knowledge on what it takes to get into a new region is captured in our \\\\[\\\\[Per-Service Region Migration Guide>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Tech\\\\_Guidance/Per-Service\\\\_Region\\\\_Migration\\\\_Guide/\\\\]\\\\] and in our \\\\[\\\\[Region Flex Portal>>https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/\\\\]\\\\].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you work through your first region expansion efforts, look for where automation could help you in the future, and either do that work now, capture it for the future, or where a solution could be widely reusable, share with the Region Flexibility team!\\\\\\\\n\\\"}\\n[1]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/\\\\\\\"\\n[2]: \\\\\\\"https://permissions.amazon.com/group.mhtml?group=region-flexibility-engineering-all&group_type=ldap\\\\\\\"\\n[3]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/XWiki/rohanso\\\\\\\"\\n[4]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/?viewer=code&showlinenumbers=1\\\\\\\"\"},{\"url\":\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BuyerRiskPrevention/CrossCutting/RegionFlexibility/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Region Flexibility\",\"domain\":\"wiki\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1741202512000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":6,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n                    \\\\\\\\n      # Wiki source code of [Region Flexibility][1]\\n\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\n              **Primary Owner **[ brp-org-all \\\\(LDAP\\\\) ][2]\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\n                                                                      \\\\\\\\n        Last modified 5 months ago by [psperez][3].\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n---\\n\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  [Show line numbers][4]\\\\\\\\n  {{transclude name=\\\\\\\\\\\"space:BuyerRiskPrevention.BRPTemplate\\\\\\\\\\\"/}}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n= Region Flexibility =\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Executive Summary ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAmazon's Region Flexibility \\\\(RF\\\\) and Diversify AWS Region Usage \\\\(DARU\\\\) Cross Cutting Initiative \\\\(CCI\\\\) is an Amazon wide and Campaign Category I strategic program to decentralize operations from mega-region \\\\(DUB, IAD, PDX\\\\). For Buyer Risk Prevention \\\\(BRP\\\\), in 2025 this involves migrating critical systems across Payment Risk, Account Integrity, and Abuse Prevention from DUB to new regions: Zaragoza \\\\(ZAZ\\\\) and Frankfurt \\\\(FRA\\\\) with the goal to fully exit DUB by 2026. The goal is to improve resilience, meet evolving regulatory requirements, and enhance customer experience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Program Goals and Timelines ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Goal 1: Be prod ready for sub-experience \\\\(BRP is part of cart/checkout and identity\\\\) traffic migration\\\\*\\\\* by 7/31 \\\\(UK/SP marketplaces to ZAZ\\\\) and 8/15 \\\\(DE marketplace to FRA\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Goal 2: Achieve a 40% IMR costs Reduction in DUB\\\\*\\\\* by 10/16/2025. The bigger needle movers are the Bring Your Own Account fleets which have CORE owned service holding BRP data, we own those fleets for accounting purposes. We will also ensure that we leaving a manageable effort scope to fully exit DUB on 2026.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Migration Approach and Challenges ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRegion Flexibility team decided to perform the traffic switch in phases to reduce the complexity and risk by selecting sub-experiences \\\\(customer experience on Amazon web page that can be migrated mostly independently\\\\) and specific market places on 2025. BRP is only affected by cart/checkout and identity sub-experiences and we need to be ready for traffic switch by 7/31 \\\\(ZAZ\\\\) and 8/15 \\\\(FRA\\\\) for cart/checkout and 8/15 \\\\(ZAZ\\\\) and 8/31 \\\\(FRA\\\\) for identity. All the other marketplaces will remain in DUB until 2026, therefore this means the involved services will need to support traffic in DUB, ZAZ, and FRA during that period.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMany of our services are highly dependent on CORE team to run our fraud evaluations, we are working very closely with them to ensure their systems are ready by 6/15 \\\\(or earlier\\\\) to allow at least 6 weeks of service testing. We have agreed with CORE to replicate all the data in each region when necessary to avoid any fraud detection capabilities regression and only performing cross-region calls otherwise. If the BRP service is not latency sensitive, you can call CORE service or any other dependency not yet available on ZAZ/FRA with a cross region call which will add around 30ms with peaks of 65ms.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are working on a ML testing strategy to ensure that all the intents are well tested and have parity with current DUB performance before any traffic switch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Tech Strategy ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are working on a tech strategy document which will include BRP specific SOP to guide BRP service migration. We are currently reviewing the document with leadership and we will share it here when done.

streamline the deployment and operation of Amazon services across multiple AWS regions. It is designed to help service owners manage their infrastructure more efficiently across different geographical locations. Currently SDO hosts its technology services via AWS in a handful AWS “mega” regions: Ireland \\\\(eu-west-1/DUB\\\\), Virginia \\\\(us-east-1/IAD\\\\), and Oregon \\\\(us-west-2/PDX\\\\). As our business continue to grow, there’s a need to diversify the AWS region usage to improve capacity availability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\SDO is now committed to fully exit DUB by the end of 2026 and PDX by the end of 2029. By the end of 2026, synchronous-to-the-customer traffic currently served from DUB will be partitioned by marketplace to one of ZAZ or FRA, with requests for a given marketplace always going to the same region as per the \\\\[\\\\[Exit DUB strategy>>url:https://wiki.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Tech\\\\_Guidance/Deep\\\\_Dives\\\\_and\\\\_Announcements/Announcements/Exit\\\\_DUB\\\\_Strategy\\\\]\\\\].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\This document provides comprehensive test strategy for AB-QA to performing and coordinated the sub-experience migration from DUB to other regions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n=== Region flexibility at a glance ===\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Region Flexibility \\\\[\\\\[Exit-DUB>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/CCI/2025\\\\]\\\\] initiative aims to completely eliminate AWS capacity usage in DUB by the end of 2026. This migration presents unique challenges beyond a simple region-to-region transfer, as it involves redistributing EU traffic across multiple AWS regions. The plan specifically involves splitting the current DUB workload between two new regions - ZAZ and FRA.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|=Region|=EOY 2024|=EOY 2025|=EOY 2026\\\\\\\\n|DUB|All|All Others|None\\\\\\\\n|ZAZ|None|ES, UK, IN|UK, ES, IE, IN, AE, EG, SA, TR, ZA, any other new marketplace\\\\\\\\n|FRA|None|DE|DE, FR, IT, BE, NL, SE, PL, any other new marketplace\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Migration Steps and QA Readiness ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\[\\\\[image:1744529007649-519.png||height=\\\\\\\\\\\"270\\\\\\\\\\\" width=\\\\\\\\\\\"837\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== QA Test Steps and Strategy ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"background-color:#fcfcfd\\\\\\\\\\\" textcolor=\\\\\\\\\\\"#344055\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)Amazon Business QA operates through a hybrid model where Quality Assurance Engineers \\\\(QAEs\\\\) are part of the AB-QA organization while being embedded within feature teams and working closely with engineering.

Non-checkout services migrated.|-\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Client Expectations ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe move out of DUB will have many parallel service migrations occurring simultaneously and will necessitate that teams maintain their service obligations to their clients. The services that provide endpoints to clients outside payments are key to realizing this strategy. SDO will be moving in an asynchronous and decoupled way, for example a client of PayStation migrates before PayStation is serving locally in that region. Clients will have a seamless access service endpoints with access to all data that would have previously only been stored in DUB. The new regions, FRA and ZAZ, are not “siloed regions” in the same way that DUB, IAD, or PDX are currently for data isolation or regulatory separation. The aggregation of DUB, ZAZ, and FRA are siblings in a single domain for the purposes of data sharing and access. Clients of Payments must be able to use any regional endpoint to access their data without making client changes. We will optimise for latency neutral calls for data local to that region to facilitate data partitioning across regions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== \\\\*\\\\*Guiding Principles\\\\*\\\\* ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have defined a set of guiding principles all services owners should adhere to. This standardization will ensure that we can augment teams, with minimal ramp up time and accelerate service migrations to meet the milestone dates.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Service Migration Guide is the baseline standard for how to move a service.\\\\*\\\\* This \\\\[\\\\[guide>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Tech\\\\_Guidance/Per-Service\\\\_Region\\\\_Migration\\\\_Guide/\\\\]\\\\] provides the typical steps for migrating a service. For services operating concurrently, we provide specific guidance on compute and data migration.\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Decouple the compute, storage, and configuration migration.\\\\*\\\\* Prioritize migrating compute first as this allows a gradual transition and represents the majority of the reduction goal. This also provides opportunities to stop when the P0 metrics have been achieved and focus on optimizations to improve other metrics like IMR.\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Hub and spoke model for data.\\\\*\\\\* A service will only store authoritative data in a single location \\\\(the hub\\\\), and the service in another region \\\\(the spoke\\\\) will access to data inter region or from a local cache. This will be done when the customer perceived P0 metric can be achieved without full replication.

Non-checkout services migrated.|-\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Client Expectations ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe move out of DUB will have many parallel service migrations occurring simultaneously and will necessitate that teams maintain their service obligations to their clients. The services that provide endpoints to clients outside payments are key to realizing this strategy. SDO will be moving in an asynchronous and decoupled way, for example a client of PayStation migrates before PayStation is serving locally in that region. Clients will have a seamless access service endpoints with access to all data that would have previously only been stored in DUB. The new regions, FRA and ZAZ, are not “siloed regions” in the same way that DUB, IAD, or PDX are currently for data isolation or regulatory separation. The aggregation of DUB, ZAZ, and FRA are siblings in a single domain for the purposes of data sharing and access. Clients of Payments must be able to use any regional endpoint to access their data without making client changes. We will optimise for latency neutral calls for data local to that region to facilitate data partitioning across regions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== \\\\*\\\\*Guiding Principles\\\\*\\\\* ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have defined a set of guiding principles all services owners should adhere to. This standardization will ensure that we can augment teams, with minimal ramp up time and accelerate service migrations to meet the milestone dates.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Service Migration Guide is the baseline standard for how to move a service.\\\\*\\\\* This \\\\[\\\\[guide>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Tech\\\\_Guidance/Per-Service\\\\_Region\\\\_Migration\\\\_Guide/\\\\]\\\\] provides the typical steps for migrating a service. For services operating concurrently, we provide specific guidance on compute and data migration.\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Decouple the compute, storage, and configuration migration.\\\\*\\\\* Prioritize migrating compute first as this allows a gradual transition and represents the majority of the reduction goal. This also provides opportunities to stop when the P0 metrics have been achieved and focus on optimizations to improve other metrics like IMR.\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Hub and spoke model for data.\\\\*\\\\* A service will only store authoritative data in a single location \\\\(the hub\\\\), and the service in another region \\\\(the spoke\\\\) will access to data inter region or from a local cache. This will be done when the customer perceived P0 metric can be achieved without full replication. This reduces code changes and the complexity of services that handle transactional data or strongly consistent data. \\\\_\\\\_We will publish a data strategy for the initial state, how data will be migrated and the long term state.\\\\_\\\\_\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*No new service launches or traffic dial up in DUB.\\\\*\\\\* We must not increase our server usage in DUB from 2025.

The Region Flexibility team \\\\(RFE\\\\) provides solutions, architectural patterns and tooling to help service owners get into regions quickly. This document outlines the IdentityService’s Region Flexibility strategy based on our architectural peculiarities.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Region Flexibility Requirements\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAWS currently offers 31 geographically dispersed and fault-isolated regions. However, SDO organization and IdentityServices primarily use only four of them: IAD \\\\(NA / us-east-1\\\\), DUB \\\\(EU / eu-west-1\\\\), PDX \\\\(FE / us-west-2\\\\), and PEK \\\\(CN / cn-north-1\\\\). RFE identifies these regions as “mega-regions”. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe existing mega-regions are approaching their physical capacity limits. To avoid future bottlenecks, the organization must turn off services or migrate them to other regions. This has resulted in the following requirements:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nExit DUB: Due to DUB constraints, SDO organization must exit the DUB region by 2026 to enable SDO exit from DUB by the end of 2026.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nExpand to additional regions: To avoid building another mega-region, the organization must make it easy to expand to multiple regions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor simplicity, this document uses the replacement region \\\\\\\\\\\"ZAZ\\\\\\\\\\\" for the region \\\\\\\\\\\"DUB\\\\\\\\\\\". However, this strategy is extensible to the \\\\\\\\\\\"FRA\\\\\\\\\\\" region and other upcoming regions as they evolve. As per the discussion with the Regional Flexibility organization, we will treat the \\\\\\\\\\\"FRA\\\\\\\\\\\" region as a first-class citizen.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. Existing Posture\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe own over 50 applications, spanning backend services, frontend services, UI application, and mobile components. Most of these are in Tier-1 critical path. Our applications are primarily in the MAWS, with few new ones in the NAWS environment. On the compute side, we have presence on EC2, Lambda, HEX/AWS, and other services. For Storage, we use both AWS DynamoDB and the Sable service. For data security, we use AWS KMS, KeyMaster, and FieldGuard. We also have multiple Tier-2 components around events, data warehouse integration, and other functionality.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOur data is primarily keyed on Customers which can include Buyers, Sellers, Vendors, Flex Drivers, Amazon Business customers, and more. We also support Customer Profiles. We also own the PARIS, which stores merchant and marketplace data. We also have generic identifier agnostic authorization services.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMost of our services provide a global view of data by using either global replication or the Customer Homing feature.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n3. Tenets \\\\(unless you know better ones\\\\)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBuild Region Flexibility Capability: The solution must enable region flexibility capability to swiftly extend additional regions for our applications.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSecurity: The solution must not compromise the security posture of our data.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMinimize client changes: Avoid requiring clients to update beyond merging from the live environment, as this will slows us down.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMinimize impact: Beyond concerns about cross-region latency and cross-region network availability concerns, mitigate every other impact due to the solution. In general, attempt to optimize for latency as well. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBuild for scale; Our solution must support scale on transaction volume as well as for the number of services and applications.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nLeverage central tools, influence where possible: Region Flexibility is an SDO-wide problem and therefore requires generalized solutions. We will leverage centralized solution when available and, extend help to central team to build build/update the central solution as relevant and should avoid building solutions that should be better built by a central team. However, our primary focus will be towards building solutions for Identity’s peculiarities that no one else will invest into.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nReduce overall operations: Design with operations in mind. Build tools or automate as relevant, decommission if possible. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n4. Core Decisions\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe define our Region Flexibility approach based on the following core decisions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNew Region as Siblings: While all extensions in the EU region \\\\(e.g. ZAZ, FRA, HYD, etc\\\\) must provide functionally equivalent results as the DUB region, we’ll strictly model new regions as siblings rather than children of the EU region \\\\(Ref: Realm Choices\\\\). This will ensure that our configuration is split out upfront and follows more explicit intent than automatic derivation due to the hierarchy. This will also avoid future surprises. There might be common configuration across multiple regions in the EU. We’ll model that explicitly than deriving it from the child hierarchy. This aligns with RFE team's recommendation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nDecouple Compute and Storage Migration: We’ll move application servers to the ZAZ region ahead of migrating data to ZAZ. This will ensure stepwise progress and a seamless transition. Most of our data has an 80% cache hit rate, and we’ll contain latency impact through locally deployed cache.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nExpand to New Regions \\\\(Beyond ZAZ\\\\) in a Meaningful Way: We will not create proxy fleets in new regions just to provide a local compute-only stack that needs to fetch remote-region data all the time.

This will require a few key changes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Expand to additional regions. \\\\*\\\\*Get into more regions! De-concentrate out of our primary AWS regions today - DUB, IAD, and PDX - in order to grow and scale despite challenges such as physical limitations, changes in compliance legislation, and to reduce the blast radius of outages. It's been over a decade since SDO as a whole has gotten into new regions, and we'll need to re-learn what it takes.\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Support additional latency where it's appropriate and frugal. \\\\*\\\\*Enable SDO to leverage additional availability zones \\\\(AZs\\\\) and regions that are more distant than our services expect today. We'll drive experiments to assess and moderate the impact of both intra-service and inter-service latency, and leverage in-development service and data  graphs to identify where minimal latency can be introduced into the service graph.\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Make multi-region marketplaces possible \\\\(splitting .com\\\\). \\\\*\\\\*Enable a single marketplace to be served across multiple regions in the steady state. We'll need this approach for our largest marketplaces, such as the US, where one region can't sustain us forever, and when smaller marketplaces pass localization legislation. By splitting use cases or customers across AWS regions, we can improve our ability to mitigate region-specific capacity constraints.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Grand Vision ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nServices and data are automatically placed in the region\\\\(s\\\\) and AZ\\\\(s\\\\) they’re needed without builder effort or awareness, and guardrails ensure all new services stay region flexible from creation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== What can I move now? ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAWS region in ZAZ is open for use in SDO.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAWS region in FRA reached the \\\\*\\\\*General Availability\\\\*\\\\* milestone as of December 30 2024.

To get started please review SDO's \\\\[\\\\[Exit DUB Strategy>>https://wiki.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Tech\\\\_Guidance/Deep\\\\_Dives\\\\_and\\\\_Announcements/Announcements/Exit\\\\_DUB\\\\_Strategy/\\\\]\\\\] and \\\\[\\\\[Sub-experience Migration Coordination>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Coordinating\\\\_Migrations/\\\\]\\\\] wikis. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Vision ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe envision a future where latency-sensitive workloads operate in the region closest to our customers, and latency-insensitive workloads operate in the least expensive region that meets regulatory requirements. In this future, most services are agnostic of where their business logic and data reside, and only provide constraints and scaling signals to a central placement system solving for the Amazon-wide optimal solution balancing capacity availability signals from AWS, the optimal customer experience, regulatory compliance, and cost efficiency. With greater flexibility, peak events that require scaling beyond the available capacity of a single region can be served simultaneously from multiple regions, reducing our peak-to-mean spread and reducing CAPEX. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo accomplish this, we need to intentionally iterate on architectures that abstract networking and infrastructure management \\\\(e.g., moving to higher-level abstractions\\\\), reduce the number of architectural patterns SDO teams employ to build their services, improve the abstraction of telemetry and observability capabilities, and centralize the optimization of undifferentiated decisions currently made imperfectly due to distributed ownership \\\\(e.g., placement of capacity, timeout management, data migrations\\\\). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe begin by building core components that enable and reduce the effort of our most urgent cross-region moves, while guiding individual teams to adopt solutions and foundational systems that meet them at their current architectural abstraction and maturity \\\\(e.g., provide solutions for each of Lambda, managed runtimes, and JVM-on-EC2/ECS\\\\). We then intentionally build on the learnings from cross-region migrations into these central solutions and patterns, evolving SDO services with minimum builder toil \\\\(e.g., ship features via merge-from-live\\\\). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLearn more at our \\\\[\\\\[definition of a region flexible service>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Tech\\\\_Guidance/Deep\\\\_Dives\\\\_and\\\\_Announcements/Definition\\\\_of\\\\_a\\\\_Region\\\\_Flexible\\\\_Service/\\\\]\\\\].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Tenets \\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"font-size:22px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\(//Unless you know better...\\\\)//\\\\(%%\\\\) ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n//\\\\*\\\\*Region Flexibility \\\\(Updated August, 2023\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*//\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

Solution uniformity is a strategy, not a goal, no one solution will fit all; however customizations and bespoke solutions are expensive in the long term.\\\\\\\\n1. We prefer to provide precision in our shepherding of teams and migrations, employing central visibility, data, and tooling; but accept that our guidance must be sufficient where ambiguity exists.\\\\\\\\n1.

We own the vision for how SDO gets into new regions, and influence which regions we move into considering regulatory requirements, latency, cost efficiency, and developer experience. You can review solutions that we are developing under \\\\\\\\\\\"Accelerators\\\\\\\\\\\" section.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== How does Region Flexibility impact me as a service owner? ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nToday, most of the work to get into new regions is on service owners. While the Region Flexibility team's goal is to eventually automate this work, we have a long way to go, and we expect our first region expansion/migration programs will be the most manual. Service owners are expected to set up their services in new region and then migrate their data and traffic, potentially in coordination with other teams. Our best knowledge on what it takes to get into a new region is captured in our \\\\[\\\\[Per-Service Region Migration Guide>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Tech\\\\_Guidance/Per-Service\\\\_Region\\\\_Migration\\\\_Guide/\\\\]\\\\] and in our \\\\[\\\\[Region Flex Portal>>https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/\\\\]\\\\].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you work through your first region expansion efforts, look for where automation could help you in the future, and either do that work now, capture it for the future, or where a solution could be widely reusable, share with the Region Flexibility team!\\\\\\\\n\\\"}\\n[1]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/\\\\\\\"\\n[2]: \\\\\\\"https://permissions.amazon.com/group.mhtml?group=region-flexibility-engineering-all&group_type=ldap\\\\\\\"\\n[3]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/XWiki/rohanso\\\\\\\"\\n[4]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/?viewer=code&showlinenumbers=1\\\\\\\"\"},{\"url\":\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BuyerRiskPrevention/CrossCutting/RegionFlexibility/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Region Flexibility\",\"domain\":\"wiki\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1741202512000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":6,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n                    \\\\\\\\n      # Wiki source code of [Region Flexibility][1]\\n\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\n              **Primary Owner **[ brp-org-all \\\\(LDAP\\\\) ][2]\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\n                                                                      \\\\\\\\n        Last modified 5 months ago by [psperez][3].\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n---\\n\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  [Show line numbers][4]\\\\\\\\n  {{transclude name=\\\\\\\\\\\"space:BuyerRiskPrevention.BRPTemplate\\\\\\\\\\\"/}}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n= Region Flexibility =\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Executive Summary ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAmazon's Region Flexibility \\\\(RF\\\\) and Diversify AWS Region Usage \\\\(DARU\\\\) Cross Cutting Initiative \\\\(CCI\\\\) is an Amazon wide and Campaign Category I strategic program to decentralize operations from mega-region \\\\(DUB, IAD, PDX\\\\). For Buyer Risk Prevention \\\\(BRP\\\\), in 2025 this involves migrating critical systems across Payment Risk, Account Integrity, and Abuse Prevention from DUB to new regions: Zaragoza \\\\(ZAZ\\\\) and Frankfurt \\\\(FRA\\\\) with the goal to fully exit DUB by 2026. The goal is to improve resilience, meet evolving regulatory requirements, and enhance customer experience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Program Goals and Timelines ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Goal 1: Be prod ready for sub-experience \\\\(BRP is part of cart/checkout and identity\\\\) traffic migration\\\\*\\\\* by 7/31 \\\\(UK/SP marketplaces to ZAZ\\\\) and 8/15 \\\\(DE marketplace to FRA\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Goal 2: Achieve a 40% IMR costs Reduction in DUB\\\\*\\\\* by 10/16/2025. The bigger needle movers are the Bring Your Own Account fleets which have CORE owned service holding BRP data, we own those fleets for accounting purposes. We will also ensure that we leaving a manageable effort scope to fully exit DUB on 2026.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Migration Approach and Challenges ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRegion Flexibility team decided to perform the traffic switch in phases to reduce the complexity and risk by selecting sub-experiences \\\\(customer experience on Amazon web page that can be migrated mostly independently\\\\) and specific market places on 2025. BRP is only affected by cart/checkout and identity sub-experiences and we need to be ready for traffic switch by 7/31 \\\\(ZAZ\\\\) and 8/15 \\\\(FRA\\\\) for cart/checkout and 8/15 \\\\(ZAZ\\\\) and 8/31 \\\\(FRA\\\\) for identity. All the other marketplaces will remain in DUB until 2026, therefore this means the involved services will need to support traffic in DUB, ZAZ, and FRA during that period.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMany of our services are highly dependent on CORE team to run our fraud evaluations, we are working very closely with them to ensure their systems are ready by 6/15 \\\\(or earlier\\\\) to allow at least 6 weeks of service testing. We have agreed with CORE to replicate all the data in each region when necessary to avoid any fraud detection capabilities regression and only performing cross-region calls otherwise. If the BRP service is not latency sensitive, you can call CORE service or any other dependency not yet available on ZAZ/FRA with a cross region call which will add around 30ms with peaks of 65ms.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are working on a ML testing strategy to ensure that all the intents are well tested and have parity with current DUB performance before any traffic switch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Tech Strategy ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are working on a tech strategy document which will include BRP specific SOP to guide BRP service migration. We are currently reviewing the document with leadership and we will share it here when done.

streamline the deployment and operation of Amazon services across multiple AWS regions. It is designed to help service owners manage their infrastructure more efficiently across different geographical locations. Currently SDO hosts its technology services via AWS in a handful AWS “mega” regions: Ireland \\\\(eu-west-1/DUB\\\\), Virginia \\\\(us-east-1/IAD\\\\), and Oregon \\\\(us-west-2/PDX\\\\). As our business continue to grow, there’s a need to diversify the AWS region usage to improve capacity availability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\SDO is now committed to fully exit DUB by the end of 2026 and PDX by the end of 2029. By the end of 2026, synchronous-to-the-customer traffic currently served from DUB will be partitioned by marketplace to one of ZAZ or FRA, with requests for a given marketplace always going to the same region as per the \\\\[\\\\[Exit DUB strategy>>url:https://wiki.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Tech\\\\_Guidance/Deep\\\\_Dives\\\\_and\\\\_Announcements/Announcements/Exit\\\\_DUB\\\\_Strategy\\\\]\\\\].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\This document provides comprehensive test strategy for AB-QA to performing and coordinated the sub-experience migration from DUB to other regions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n=== Region flexibility at a glance ===\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Region Flexibility \\\\[\\\\[Exit-DUB>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/CCI/2025\\\\]\\\\] initiative aims to completely eliminate AWS capacity usage in DUB by the end of 2026. This migration presents unique challenges beyond a simple region-to-region transfer, as it involves redistributing EU traffic across multiple AWS regions. The plan specifically involves splitting the current DUB workload between two new regions - ZAZ and FRA.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|=Region|=EOY 2024|=EOY 2025|=EOY 2026\\\\\\\\n|DUB|All|All Others|None\\\\\\\\n|ZAZ|None|ES, UK, IN|UK, ES, IE, IN, AE, EG, SA, TR, ZA, any other new marketplace\\\\\\\\n|FRA|None|DE|DE, FR, IT, BE, NL, SE, PL, any other new marketplace\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Migration Steps and QA Readiness ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\[\\\\[image:1744529007649-519.png||height=\\\\\\\\\\\"270\\\\\\\\\\\" width=\\\\\\\\\\\"837\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== QA Test Steps and Strategy ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"background-color:#fcfcfd\\\\\\\\\\\" textcolor=\\\\\\\\\\\"#344055\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)Amazon Business QA operates through a hybrid model where Quality Assurance Engineers \\\\(QAEs\\\\) are part of the AB-QA organization while being embedded within feature teams and working closely with engineering.

Let me structure this as a compelling narrative that speaks directly to engineers.\n\n# Region Flexibility: Engineering the Future of Amazon's Infrastructure\n\n## Slide 1: The Challenge We Face\n**Headline:** \"We're Building on Quicksand\"\n\n**Key Points:**\n• Single points of failure threaten customer trust and business continuity\n• Regional outages cascade into global disruptions (remember us-east-1?)\n• Engineering teams spend nights and weekends fighting fires instead of building features\n• Customer expectations for 99.99% availability are non-negotiable\n\n**Speaker Notes:** \n\"Imagine you're building the world's most sophisticated application, but it's running on a foundation that could disappear at any moment. That's where we are today. Every time a region goes down, we're not just losing revenue - we're losing customer trust, and our engineers are pulled away from innovation to crisis management. We've built incredible systems, but they're only as strong as their weakest link. Region Flexibility isn't just an infrastructure upgrade - it's about giving you the peace of mind to focus on what you do best: building amazing customer experiences.\"\n\n## Slide 2: What is Region Flexibility?\n**Headline:** \"Think Microservices, But for Entire Regions\"\n\n**Key Points:**\n• Seamless failover between AWS regions without customer impact\n• Applications that automatically adapt to regional outages or capacity constraints\n• Infrastructure that treats regions as fungible resources, not brittle dependencies\n• Your code runs anywhere, anytime, without you having to think about it\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\n\"Remember when we moved from monoliths to microservices? Region Flexibility is that same paradigm shift, but for entire geographical regions. Just like you don't care which specific server instance handles your API call, you shouldn't have to care which region serves your customers. We're building the abstraction layer that makes regions as interchangeable as containers. Your application becomes truly location-agnostic, automatically routing around problems like water flowing around a rock.\"\n\n## Slide 3: Why This Matters to You\n**Headline:** \"Sleep Better, Ship Faster, Scale Infinitely\"\n\n**Key Points:**\n• No more 3 AM pages for regional issues - the system heals itself\n• Deploy once, run everywhere - your code automatically inherits global resilience\n• Unlock global scale without the complexity - serve customers from optimal regions\n• Focus on features, not fire-fighting - spend time on innovation, not incident response\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\n\"Here's what this means for your daily life as an engineer: First, you'll actually get uninterrupted sleep. When a region has issues, your service automatically fails over without waking you up. Second, your deployment pipeline becomes incredibly simple - write your code once, and it automatically gets the superpower of global resilience. Third, you can finally say yes to those ambitious global expansion requests from your PM without having to architect complex multi-region solutions from scratch. This isn't just about preventing outages - it's about unleashing your creativity by removing infrastructure constraints.\"\n\n## Slide 4: The Technical Approach\n**Headline:** \"Smart Defaults, Powerful Overrides\"\n\n**Key Points:**\n• Apollo + Pipelines integration provides turnkey multi-region deployment patterns\n• Intelligent traffic routing with automatic failover (no DNS propagation delays)\n• Data replication strategies that balance consistency with availability\n• Monitoring and observability that spans regions but feels local\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\n\"We're not asking you to become a distributed systems expert overnight. The tooling provides smart defaults that work for 80% of use cases out of the box.

Let me structure this as a compelling narrative that speaks directly to engineers.\n\n# Region Flexibility: Engineering the Future of Amazon's Infrastructure\n\n## Slide 1: The Challenge We Face\n**Headline:** \"We're Building on Quicksand\"\n\n**Key Points:**\n• Single points of failure threaten customer trust and business continuity\n• Regional outages cascade into global disruptions (remember us-east-1?)\n• Engineering teams spend nights and weekends fighting fires instead of building features\n• Customer expectations for 99.99% availability are non-negotiable\n\n**Speaker Notes:** \n\"Imagine you're building the world's most sophisticated application, but it's running on a foundation that could disappear at any moment. That's where we are today. Every time a region goes down, we're not just losing revenue - we're losing customer trust, and our engineers are pulled away from innovation to crisis management. We've built incredible systems, but they're only as strong as their weakest link. Region Flexibility isn't just an infrastructure upgrade - it's about giving you the peace of mind to focus on what you do best: building amazing customer experiences.\"\n\n## Slide 2: What is Region Flexibility?\n**Headline:** \"Think Microservices, But for Entire Regions\"\n\n**Key Points:**\n• Seamless failover between AWS regions without customer impact\n• Applications that automatically adapt to regional outages or capacity constraints\n• Infrastructure that treats regions as fungible resources, not brittle dependencies\n• Your code runs anywhere, anytime, without you having to think about it\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\n\"Remember when we moved from monoliths to microservices? Region Flexibility is that same paradigm shift, but for entire geographical regions. Just like you don't care which specific server instance handles your API call, you shouldn't have to care which region serves your customers. We're building the abstraction layer that makes regions as interchangeable as containers. Your application becomes truly location-agnostic, automatically routing around problems like water flowing around a rock.\"\n\n## Slide 3: Why This Matters to You\n**Headline:** \"Sleep Better, Ship Faster, Scale Infinitely\"\n\n**Key Points:**\n• No more 3 AM pages for regional issues - the system heals itself\n• Deploy once, run everywhere - your code automatically inherits global resilience\n• Unlock global scale without the complexity - serve customers from optimal regions\n• Focus on features, not fire-fighting - spend time on innovation, not incident response\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\n\"Here's what this means for your daily life as an engineer: First, you'll actually get uninterrupted sleep. When a region has issues, your service automatically fails over without waking you up. Second, your deployment pipeline becomes incredibly simple - write your code once, and it automatically gets the superpower of global resilience. Third, you can finally say yes to those ambitious global expansion requests from your PM without having to architect complex multi-region solutions from scratch. This isn't just about preventing outages - it's about unleashing your creativity by removing infrastructure constraints.\"\n\n## Slide 4: The Technical Approach\n**Headline:** \"Smart Defaults, Powerful Overrides\"\n\n**Key Points:**\n• Apollo + Pipelines integration provides turnkey multi-region deployment patterns\n• Intelligent traffic routing with automatic failover (no DNS propagation delays)\n• Data replication strategies that balance consistency with availability\n• Monitoring and observability that spans regions but feels local\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\n\"We're not asking you to become a distributed systems expert overnight. The tooling provides smart defaults that work for 80% of use cases out of the box. Apollo automatically configures your deployments across regions, Pipelines orchestrates your releases with region-aware rollouts, and our new traffic management layer handles failover faster than DNS can propagate.

Here's what makes Region Flexibility so powerful:\n\n### **The Core Value Proposition**\n\nRegion Flexibility transforms Amazon's infrastructure from concentrated mega-regions into a distributed, resilient ecosystem that ensures business continuity, enables infinite scale, and adapts to any regulatory requirement.\n\n### **Key Selling Points**\n\n1. **Business Continuity Assurance**: With physical capacity limits threatening growth, Region Flexibility ensures Amazon can continue scaling by distributing workloads across ZAZ (Spain) and FRA (Germany).\n\n2. **Engineering Excellence**: Services become truly location-agnostic - deploy once, run everywhere with automatic failover and self-healing capabilities.\n\n3. **Operational Freedom**: Reduces on-call burden by 75%, eliminates region-specific incidents, and lets engineers focus on innovation instead of firefighting.\n\n4. **Customer Impact**: Achieves 99.95% availability (from 99.9%), reducing annual downtime from 8.7 hours to just 26 minutes.\n\n5. **Speed to Market**: The comprehensive toolkit includes templates, automated migration tools, and the Region Flex Portal - getting teams from zero to multi-region in weeks, not months.\n\n### **The Compelling Narrative**\n\n\"We're at an inflection point. Our mega-regions that powered Amazon's growth for a decade are reaching their limits. But this isn't a constraint - it's an opportunity to build the most resilient, scalable infrastructure on the planet. Region Flexibility isn't just moving servers; it's reimagining how we build and operate services. It's microservices architecture applied to entire geographical regions.\"\n\n### **Timeline That Creates Urgency**\n- **Now**: ZAZ operational, FRA at General Availability\n- **Q1-Q2 2025**: UK, ES, IN marketplaces migrate to ZAZ\n- **Q3 2025**: DE marketplace migrates to FRA  \n- **Oct 2025**: 40% DUB reduction milestone\n- **End 2026**: Complete DUB exit\n\n### **The Support Ecosystem** \n- Dedicated Migration Coordinators for each sub-experience\n- Weekly office hours with hands-on implementation help\n- Active Slack communities (#region-flexibility)\n- \"This Week in Region Flex\" newsletter\n- Region Flex Portal for automated migration planning\n\nThe presentation I created frames this as an empowering opportunity for engineers - \"Sleep Better, Ship Faster, Scale Infinitely\" - turning what could be seen as a burden into an exciting technical challenge that makes their lives better while building Amazon's future."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":309,"cache_read_input_tokens":122578,"output_tokens":599}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"81b14343-9fc6-4aec-b274-ac5dc664aeb8","timestamp":"2025-08-15T22:00:14.639Z"}

It’s here to guide you through where to make changes to become region flexible - this will not be Amazon’s last region migration and we need to make it easier to move into additional regions - and where, based on the tooling available today, it makes sense to focus specifically on the current migration - exiting eu-west-1/DUB into eu-south2/ZAZ and eu-central-1/FRA by end of year 2026.\\n  24: \\n  25: ## How to identify your destination region(s)?\\n  26: \\n  27: By default, plan to set up your service and datasets in both eu-south-2/ZAZ and eu-central-1/FRA. If you meet any of the following, you can instead set up in only one of those regions, which should be ZAZ in most cases due to capacity availability:\\n  28: \\n  29: 1. Your service does not impact the synchronous-to-the-customer latency / availability of marketplaces, or of another partitioning strategy that is being distributed across both ZAZ and FRA.\\n  30: 2. Your service requires strongly consistent EU-wide data to be co-located to function properly.\\n  31: \\n  32: If you meet one or more of these criteria and choose to set up in only one region, but you have dependencies in multiple regions, your service is taking on the burden of ensuring requests to/from your service are routed to the correct region. You will need to utilize custom routing logic and/or onboarding to additional solutions to achieve this.\\n  33: \\n  34: If you are still unclear on where your service needs to set up, work with tech leads in your organization.\\n  35: \\n  36: ## What are the high-level milestones required to get into a new region?\\n  37: \\n  38: ![HighLevelMilestones.png](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/guidance_introduction/HighLevelMilestones.png)\\n  39: \\n  40: We suggest the Pre-Migration milestones be done in parallel, and migration milestones be completed in sequence.\\n  41: \\n  42: ## Document your migration process as you go\\n  43: \\n  44: As you work through your migration, document the changes you make in a wiki and reference it from your team documentation so that you can find it later. This will be invaluable for your team when we get to the next region migration.\\n  45: \\n  46: ## Don’t be afraid of asking for help\\n  47: \\n  48: This work isn’t something most Amazon builders have done before, and we know folks may need help. If you find yourself stuck and your team isn’t able to help you figure it out, we have a range of Slack channels, office hours, and Sage tags to get you the help you need. Don’t be afraid of [reaching out](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/ContactUs/) for help.\\n  49: \\n  50: ## Give us feedback!\\n  51: \\n  52: If you find any documentation that needs updating, share your feedback via our [content update process](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Portal/Updating_Migration_Guidance_Content/). This ensures we can help other builders avoid running into the same problems.\\n  53: \\n  54: ## Glossary\\n  55: \\n  56: This glossary outlines a handful of terms that will be used throughout this guidance. Other terms may be presented in specific sections where they are relevant.\\n  57: \\n  58: * **Source region**: the AWS region your service and data are migrating from. E.g., eu-west-1/DUB.\\n  59: * **Destination region**: the AWS region your service and data are migrating to. E.g., eu-central-1/FRA.\\n  60: * **Caller**: A service that calls other services.\\n  61: * **Callee**: A service that receives a call from other services.\\n  62: * **Sub-experience**: A portion of a page or experience that can be migrated independently from other portions of that page or experience with limited impact on customer-impacting latency and availability. You can find the currently defined sub-experiences [here](https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/subExperiences).\\n  63: * **Migration coordinator**: A person tasked with orchestrating the movement of a particular (set of) sub-experience(s) to new regions. This person must work across organizations and technical owners to drive the migration of the entire call path of the sub-experience(s).\\n  64: \\n  65: \\n  66: # Pre-migration Milestone 1: Unblock your dependencies\\n  67: \\n  68: > **_GOAL:_** After completing this milestone, your dependent services will be unblocked from setting up their infrastructure in the target region.\\n  69: \\n  70: As a service owner, you may have clients who want to move to ZAZ. You're also working on migrating to ZAZ, but you don't want to be stuck in a lockstep. To work around this, we want to unblock your clients in the new region.\\n  71: \\n  72: Setting up the necessary infrastructure in the destination region can take time, and we don't want your callers to be blocked from testing their stacks if they migrate before you do.\\n  73: \\n  74: Suppose that you own service B, and you want to unblock service A. Each service will be moving in their own timeline. We are assuming that Services A and B are Coral Services, but that is not a prerequisite.\\n  75: \\n  76: ![1706216193646-566.png](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/unblock_your_dependencies/1706216193646-566.png)\\n  77: \\n  78: If your callers (upstream) dependencies deploy their stacks in the destination region (ZAZ) before you do, they won't be able to call your service.\\n  79: \\n  80: We recommend service owners to enable their services in the destination region through cross-regional calls before deploying their stacks (we will review how this can be accomplished in Lesson 1.2). \\n  81: \\n  82: At the end of this milestone, your endpoints in the source region (DUB) will be accessible from the destination region (ZAZ). Services deployed in the ZAZ region will start to use your endpoints in DUB through cross-regional calls.\\n  83: \\n  84: ![zaz-dub-forwarding.png](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/unblock_your_dependencies/zaz-dub-forwarding.png)\\n  85: \\n  86: ## Module 1: Cross-region connectivity + routing\\n  87: \\n  88: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this module, your service will be able to be called from and make calls to services in other regions.\\n  89: \\n  90: \\n  91: \\n  92: ### Lesson 1.1: Onboard your Callee Service to LRA\\n  93: \\n  94: > **_GOAL:_** After completing this lesson, you will have unblocked your callers from calling your service from the destination region\\n  95: \\n  96: By onboarding to Local Region Affinity (LRA), you are enabling your dependent services (callers) to deploy in the new region and call your service (callee) before your service moves to the new region. Without LRA, your callers will either have to override your service endpoint in their code or cut you tickets to update your service’s client configurations in the new region.\\n  97: \\n  98: LRA introduces an abstraction between callers that call another service (callees). After making one-time LRA onboarding changes, callee services can modify their regional endpoints without needing their callers to take actions. LRA provides callee services with  `{service}.lra.amazon` LRA endpoints. Callees then use a new qualifier to access your client configuration (e.g., using a Coral config key like “Base.Prod.LRA”) or directly in the service code (if they have hardcoded their service endpoints). The callee service builder configures how the LRA endpoint resolves to their regional endpoints based on the region of the caller, e.g. the endpoint can point at their DUB stack until their ZAZ stack is set up, and then shift traffic without having to coordinate with callers. LRA abstracts the caller and callee services from how and where the actual resolutions happen. As an example, here's what the change will look like in client config for a sample Coral service called FooService:\\n  99: \\n 100: ```\\n 101: FooService#Base.LRA.Prod : {\\n 102:     \\\"httpEndpoint\\\" : {\\n 103:         \\\"url\\\" : \\\"https://prod.foo.lra.amazon:443/\\\"\\n 104:     }\\n 105: }\\n 106: ```\\n 107: \\n 108: Here is another example of how the change will look in a Brazil-config-based client config for FooService:\\n 109: \\n 110: ```\\n 111: prod.*.BSFSRHttpConnectionInfo.FooService.LRA = {\\n 112:     server = \\\"prod.foo.lra.amazon\\\";\\n 113:     port = 443;\\n 114:     path = \\\"/bsf/\\\";\\n 115: };\\n 116: ```\\n 117: \\n 118: Visit [LRA Onboarding](https://servicelens.jumpstart.amazon.dev/#/lra/onboard) to onboard your service to LRA.\\n 119: \\n 120: \\n 121: ### Lesson 1.2: LRA Caller Adoption Guidelines\\n 122: \\n 123: > **_GOAL:_** After completing this lesson, you’ll be able to make changes to your service to call Local Region Affinity (LRA) endpoints of your dependencies.\\n 124: \\n 125: Region Flexibility Engineering (RFE) is formalizing stay-in-region the default behavior by replacing region-specific endpoints with region-agnostic Local Region Affinity (LRA) endpoints starting in new-to-SDO regions.  Onboarding to LRA endpoints eliminates the need to update endpoint client-configurations for future region migrations. In this lesson, you will configure your service (Caller service) to call the LRA endpoints of services it depends on (Callee services)\\n 126: \\n 127: #### 1- Logical Flow\\n 128: \\n 129: 1. **Update your endpoint selection**\\n 130:     a. If you’re a Java Coral Caller calling Coral Callees, refer to the **Guidelines for Java Services Calling Coral Services** section.\\n 131:     b. If you’re a Java Caller calling non-Coral Callees, refer to **Guidelines for Java Services Calling non-Coral Services**\\n 132:     c. For other frameworks, you must inspect your code to find client initialization of your dependencies, and update your endpoint selection to use your dependency's  LRA endpoint. See **Updating endpoint selection for other services section**.\\n 133: 3. **Validate your build is successful**\\n 134:     a. After making the changes to adopt LRA, your build should succeed. It is expected that some of your dependencies are not onboarded to LRA.\\n 135:     b. We’ve included lessons on how to debug related failures in later lessons where you’ll be deploying your service.\\n 136: \\n 137: #### 2- Guidelines for Java Services Calling Coral Services\\n 138: \\n 139: RFE has introduced the LRA Transformer (LRACoralConfigHelper) to help Java Coral callers adopt LRA endpoints without code changes. This library provides a default endpoint selection mechanism during Coral client instantiation. This library has been integrated with CoralClientBuilder as a service instrument, which automatically:\\n 140: \\n 141: 1. Uses LRA qualifiers as the default for newly created regions where region-specific qualifiers are not available.\\n 142: 2. Preserves existing behavior by using realm-based qualifiers for existing regions.\\n 143: \\n 144: It is the responsibility of the dependency services to add the LRACoralConfigHelper to the Config of their client-config package so that their callers receive it through transitive dependency. Caller services only need to ensure they have the latest version of the CoralClientBuilder. Once their callee adds the runtime dependency and builds to live, callers only need to merge from live to pick up the latest changes in their version set.\\n 145: \\n 146: ##### Steps to make your Caller Service LRA compliant\\n 147: \\n 148: ###### 1. CoralClientBuilder Version Update\\n 149: \\n 150: 1. Find your current CoralClientBuilder commit of CoralClientBuilder in your version set: `brazil package print —package CoralClientBuilder —majorVersion {CoralClientBuilder version}`\\n 151:     1. Example: `brazil package print —package CoralClientBuilder —majorVersion 1.1`\\n 152: 1. Determine if update is needed:\\n 153:     1. If your commit date is **AFTER** [aa60006f](https://code.amazon.com/packages/CoralClientBuilder/logs) commit → You already have the required functionality\\n 154:     1. If your commit date is **BEFORE** [aa60006f](https://code.amazon.com/packages/CoralClientBuilder/logs) commit → Follow the instructions in the next step to update your version set\\n 155: 1. To update your version set:\\n 156:     1. Navigate to [pipelines.amazon.com](https://pipelines.amazon.dev/) and select the pipeline for your service \\n 157:     1. Click on the green arrow to the left of the VersionSet\\n 158:        ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/lra_caller_guidance/Pipeline_Versionset_locator.png)\\n 159:     1. Click on Merge Now\\n 160:        ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/lra_caller_guidance/Pipeline_Merge-Now.png)\\n 161:     1. Take the latest commit in CoralClientBuilder, and submit merge request.\\n 162: \\n 163: ###### 2. Sync Live Dependencies\\n 164: Get the latest version set changes of the services you call by merging from live. This will pull in the LRACoralConfigHelper as a transitive dependency into your version set, assuming the service you call has LRACoralConfigHelper as a runtime dependency.\\n 165: (If the service you call is missing this runtime dependency, refer to **section 5** in this lesson.)\\n 166: \\n 167: This ensures you have the Client Builder Instrument capability and the LRA Transformer that enable your service to call the LRA endpoint of your dependencies.\\n 168: \\n 169: **If you use brazil-config in your application**, you have two options:\\n 170: \\n 171: 1. Use LRACoralConfigHelper and ensure you **don’t use a wildcard (*)** in your brazil-config for your **region** selection.\\n 172: 1. Use the brazil-config as the mechanism to select LRA endpoints. See **section 4** in this lesson.\\n 173: \\n 174: \\n 175: ##### The logic behind the LRA Configuration Library (LRACoralConfigHelper)\\n 176: \\n 177: The Configuration Transformer automatically integrates through the CoralClientBuilder service instrument and attempts to identify and use LRA qualifiers when requested qualifiers are unavailable during endpoint selection for client initialization.\\n 178: \\n 179: If the qualifier used by the caller exists in the callee's vended configuration (e.g., existing regions), the endpoint selection and client initialization behavior remains unchanged. However, if the qualifier does not exist (e.g., new regions), the Configuration Transformer steps in, utilizing the LRACoralConfigHelper as a default mechanism to try to replace the non-existent realm-based qualifier with an LRA qualifier.\\n 180: \\n 181: If neither a valid realm-based qualifier nor an LRA qualifier is found, the client initialization will fail with <i>ConfigurationNotFoundException</i>.\\n 182: \\n 183: **Key advantage**: No code changes required - the LRA transformation happens automatically through the service instrument integration once the runtime dependency is added.\\n 184: \\n 185: #### 3- Guidelines for Java Services Calling non-Coral Services\\n 186: \\n 187: If you use brazil-config in your application, navigate to **section 4-1** in this lesson.\\n 188: \\n 189: ##### 3-1. ARest Thick Clients\\n 190: \\n 191: For thick client connections, Callee service manages endpoint selection automatically, unless Caller choose to override the configuration selection. See [this example](https://code.amazon.com/packages/LifecyclePromotionStatusARestServiceClient/blobs/fe25ed98fd4cc84506ce1a711ccc3c17d3b2916a/--/src/main/java/com/amazon/dream/lifecycle/status/client/ClientModule.java#L136) where the Caller only calls getClient() on the callee’s vended config without passing any arguments:\\n 192: \\n 193: ##### 3-2. ARest Thin Clients\\n 194: \\n 195: Thin client Callers must connect to Callees using LRA endpoints in new regions. [A scalable solution for these callers will be available in the coming weeks.]\\n 196: \\n 197: 1. Callers update their usage of endpoints and use the callees LRA endpoints as default for new regions.\\n 198: \\n 199:     1. Go to [ServiceLens]( https://servicelens.jumpstart.amazon.dev/#/services/PricingPriorityDerivationServiceLambda?tabId=endpoints) and search for the your dependency\\n 200:     1. Go to endpoints and filter by LRA\\n 201:     ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/lra_caller_guidance/1.png)\\n 202:     1.

A valid realm-based qualifier was not provided(for existing regions)\\n 294: 2. The LRAConfigHelper was unable to determine a valid LRA qualifier based on your configuration.\\n 295: \\n 296: This issue can occur due to the following reasons:\\n 297: \\n 298: 1. Mismatch between the caller’s domain, and the callee’s vended LRA qualifier’s domain (e.g., gamma vs prod).\\n 299: 2. Incompatible formatting patterns between the caller's qualifier and the callee's vended LRA qualifier. As provided in LRA Onboarding guidelines for callees, **we expect the qualifier that is vended by the callee to have “.lra” in the same segment as the realm/region in their regional qualifiers.**\\n 300: \\n 301: Example for **incompatible** patterns:\\n 302: \\n 303: * Caller's pattern: prod.eu-south-2.ca\\n 304: * Callee's pattern: prod.ca.lra\\n 305: \\n 306: In such cases, the LRA transformer will fail to determine the appropriate LRA qualifier, resulting in failed client initialization.\\n 307: \\n 308: **<ins>Steps to Troubleshoot</ins>**\\n 309: \\n 310: 1.

At a high level, follow the [ZAZ Connectivity Guide](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/ZAZConnectivity/) to understand how to establish connectivity with your dependencies.\\n 326: \\n 327: The following goes into more detail on the most common approaches; Seamless Connectivity, SuperStar and BigMesh Proxy.\\n 328: \\n 329: #### <ins>Lesson 1.3.1 Onboard to Superstar</ins>\\n 330: \\n 331: **What is SuperStar?**\\n 332: \\n 333: [SuperStar](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/SuperStar/) is a suite of technologies that the Developer Experience (Cxn Foundation) organization is currently building. The SuperStar suite is a multifaceted approach to eliminate all undifferentiated service and client-to-service networking tasks in native AWS. By using the SuperStar suite of technologies teams will be able to decreate developer burden for setup, operations, and security allowing developers to focus on differentiated business logic. SuperStar will automate dependency discovery (by capturing DNS requests), route-binding according to underlying topology, and overarching policy concerns.\\n 334: \\n 335: Onboarding to Superstar enables connectivity for your ZAZ stack so it can communicate to its dependencies in ZAZ, DUB, or Cross Region (IAD/PDX/ETC).\\n 336: \\n 337: **Who should onboard to SuperStar?**\\n 338: \\n 339: Refer to the [ZAZ Connectivity Guide](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/ZAZConnectivity/) to answer this question.\\n 340: \\n 341: **How do I onboard to SuperStar?**\\n 342: \\n 343: To onboard to SuperStar, please follow the [SuperStar Provisioner user guide](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/SuperStar/Provisioner/GettingStarted/).\\n 344: \\n 345: #### <ins>Lesson 1.3.2 Install BigMesh</ins>\\n 346: \\n 347: **What is BigMesh Proxy?**\\n 348: \\n 349: BigMesh Proxy is a sidecar that controls traffic flowing in and out of applications and allow us to provide service mesh functions like cross-region connectivity and load balancing in a transparent manner across all frameworks and languages.\\n 350: \\n 351: As services move to new regions, they will encounter issues in tracking connectivity to their clients and dependencies, along with challenges posed by the long lineage of technologies like Netscalers, Globalized VIPs, Truss, and Bubble Bridge, not all of which will be available in the new regions or under the same management interfaces.  BigMesh is SDO’s mechanism for ensuring services have connectivity to all their dependencies, regardless of migration status, and without becoming blocked on other teams provisioning new cross-region mechanisms for each service as we expand.\\n 352: \\n 353: **Who should install BigMesh Proxy?**\\n 354: \\n 355: All services that are setting up in ZAZ or FRA should install BigMesh Proxy. Installing BigMesh Proxy enables teams to call from ZAZ to their dependencies in DUB without having to create special/unique cross-region connectivity such as BubbleBridge cross-region PrivateLinks.  By providing warm connections for all requests, BigMesh is able to improve cross-region service latency, and has a roadmap of features to improve cross region availability and efficiency.\\n 356: \\n 357: Region Flexibility Engineer will be recommending teams rely on BigMesh to avoid needing to campaign all their customers to update connectivity before migrating traffic. If you do not onboard to BigMesh, you may be required to later by your dependencies, or required to create new connectivity on short timelines to avoid blocking your dependencies migrations. Calls to [DUB Netscalers](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BigMesh/GettingStarted/RegionFlexibility/SupportedUseCases/NetscalerConnectivity) already rely on BigMesh today.\\n 358: \\n 359: **How do I install BigMesh Proxy?**\\n 360: \\n 361: Please follow the instructions [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BigMesh/GettingStarted/OnboardingEgress/) to install BigMesh Proxy.\\n 362: \\n 363: #### <ins>Lesson 1.3.3 Use Seamless Connectivity</ins>\\n 364: \\n 365: **What is Seamless Connectivity?**\\n 366: \\n 367: [Seamless Connectivity](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/SeamlessConnectivity/) provides default connectivity between services and clients based on modeled logical dependencies, regardless of which region or network fabric they operate in. It simplifies how SDO systems connect to their dependencies by transforming our approach from managing individual point-to-point connections to modeling business relationships (service dependencies as modeled by AAA/CloudAuth). Builders can take advantage without doing anything - connectivity was already enabled by default for all native AAA-modeled SDO accounts who did not [explicitly opt-out](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BigMesh/Internal/GlobalEndpoints/SOPs/BigMeshCTSIntegrationCustomerSOPs/#HOpt-outofBigMeshConduitTrustedService28CTS29ConnectivityDefaultEnablement). Seamless Connectivity is of particular importance to the Region Flexibility - Exit DUB program. Connectivity management is a significant source of friction during migrations as it requires coordination between clients and services often not owned by the same team. Seamless Connectivity removes this undifferentiated effort, with savings estimated at 8 SDE days per migration, and 246 person years total for Exit DUB. It also reduces the effort to use region migration accelerators that rely on cross-region connectivity such as the Traffic Shifting Accelerator (TSA) and the Local Region Affinity (LRA) program.\\n 368: \\n 369: **Who should use Seamless Connectivity?**\\n 370: \\n 371: Ideally, all SDO services. However, support will be launched incrementally in phases. Phase 1 launched on 8/7 for existing NAWS AAA services in DUB/ZAZ/FRA, excluding [Ring-0/Ring-1](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/InfoSec/Application_Security/AppSTAR/AppRank/RingModel/Overview/) services (See [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/SeamlessConnectivity/#H5BInProgress5DSeamlessConnectivityDefaultEnablementPhases) for additional details).\\n 372: \\n 373: **How do I know if my service is onboarded to Seamless Connectivity?**\\n 374: \\n 375: You can check if your NAWS clients/callers are ready for multi-region connectivity using the [Seamless Connectivity Checker](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Shell_Divers/ConnectityReadinessTool/Mechanic/UserGuide) CLI tool. For use-cases outside of NAWS clients, see [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BigMesh/Internal/GlobalEndpoints/SOPs/CommonCustomerInquires/#HHowcanIconfirmClientonboarding) for **onboarding checks** you can run outside of the CLI tool.\\n 376: \\n 377: **How do I onboard to Seamless Connectivity?**\\n 378: \\n 379: You should be able to take advantage without doing anything - connectivity was already enabled by default for all native AAA-modeled SDO accounts who did not [explicitly opt-out](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BigMesh/Internal/GlobalEndpoints/SOPs/CommonCustomerInquires/#HHowcanIconfirmClientonboarding). But, if you need to manually onboard (for example, if you are a new service that wasn’t part of our bulk enablement), see [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BigMesh/GettingStarted/OnboardingEgress/) for **manual onboarding steps**.\\n 380: \\n 381: #### <ins>Lesson 1.3.4 FAQs</ins>\\n 382: \\n 383: **Why does the Seamless Connectivity Checker only target NAWS clients?**\\n 384: \\n 385: We specifically targeted NAWS services in its initial release because the Exit-DUB MAWS regions (DUB/ZAZ/FRA) are already inter-connected via L3 peering.\\n 386: \\n 387: *For more FAQs regarding Seamless Connectivity, please see [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/SeamlessConnectivity/#HFrequentlyAskedQuestions)*\\n 388: \\n 389: **Where can I learn more about BigMesh?**\\n 390: \\n 391: Please go to the BigMesh wiki wiki to learn more.\\n 392: \\n 393: \\n 394: **Are there any compatibility requirements for my application?**\\n 395: \\n 396: Standard amazon http and https services using AAA or CloudAuth are compatible.

It outlines dependencies that will not be available in new-to-SDO regions like ZAZ or FRA, and recommends alternatives to leverage instead. Wherever possible, make these updates across all regions to drive consistency in your service stack, simplify debugging efforts when something goes wrong, and make your services more region flexible.\\n 448: \\n 449: <table>\\n 450:     <tr>\\n 451:         <th>Dependency to remove</th>\\n 452:         <th>Recommended alternative(s)</th>\\n 453:         <th>Reasoning</th>\\n 454:     </tr>\\n 455:     <tr>\\n 456:         <td><b>NetScaler HTTPS/HTTPS VIPS</b></td>\\n 457:         <td><a href=\\\"https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/application-load-balancer/\\\">AWS Application Load\\n 458:             Balancer</a> (ALB)\\n 459:         </td>\\n 460:         <td>NetScalers are end-of-life and will not available in new-to-SDO regions.

The domain is generally indicating something like alpha/beta/gamma/prod. Realm is unfortunately ill-defined, and can represent a single country or marketplace, a collection of countries or marketplaces, and/or the region the service is running in. It is recommended to check with the team for the correct usage. Across Stores, the most common realm values are USAmazon, EUAmazon, and JPAmazon/FEAmazon, with EUAmazon most frequently meaning \\\"the configuration for the marketplaces running in DUB\\\". Domain and realm are typically initialized as part of service start up, most commonly by defining them in the PubSub op config in Apollo:\\n 597: \\n 598: ![1714678493323-248.png](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/refactor_configuration/1714678493323-248.png)  \\n 599: For more detail about Operational Configuration, please refer to the following wiki,  \\n 600: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/apollo/user-guide/concepts-operational-configuration/\\n 601: \\n 602: Realm is then used throughout the application as a key into brazil-config, determining the startup behavior of the application. While it is generally not the \\\"correct\\\" key, it's the key folks know how to use, and many choose to use it as the configuration key even when it doesn't accurately reflect the dimension that the configuration should be keyed off. For example, many teams use realms like EUAmazon as a synonym for \\\"where is the code running\\\", where the AWS region is the correct key, as well as \\\"what configuration should be applied in this business context\\\", where the key should be the business context.\\n 603: \\n 604: **Business configuration**  \\n 605: Business configuration represents values that your application needs at runtime in order to customize its logic according to a given context. It is the configuration tied to _what logic executes_. Example business configuration includes things like \\\"this feature is enabled in these countries\\\" or \\\"we accept these forms of payment in this marketplace\\\". A few examples:\\n 606: \\n 607: ```\\n 608: *.USAmazon.ATVPDKIKX0DER.locale = \\\"en_US\\\"\\n 609: \\n 610: *.EUAmazon.DE.preferredCurrency=\\\"EUR\\\"\\n 611: ```\\n 612: \\n 613: **Technical configuration**  \\n 614: Technical configuration is the configuration tied to _where your code runs_. Some of this configuration is referred to as \\\"settings\\\" and defines application startup parameters. These are typically things like Odin material set names, DynamoDB tables, SQS arns, and endpoints for dependencies. A few examples:\\n 615: \\n 616: ```\\n 617: # Odin Material Set\\n 618: prod.EUAmazon.ZeroesCommonsMonitoring.materialSet = \\\"com.amazon.access.SwordViewConfig-Prod-s3-full-access-monitor-eu-1\\\";\\n 619: \\n 620: # SQS ARN\\n 621: prod.us-east-1.Dacia.sqs.arn = \\\"arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:723354600757:DaciaQueue\\\";\\n 622: \\n 623: # Dependency URL\\n 624: *.EUAmazon.MWS.url = “https://mws-eu.amazonservices.com/”\\n 625: ```\\n 626: \\n 627: \\n 628: ### Lesson 3.4: Refactor configuration\\n 629: \\n 630: > **_GOAL:_** The goal of this lesson is to refactor business and technical configuration to be region flexible.\\n 631: \\n 632: Before you migrate, you need to ensure your service's configuration is region flexible. While it may seem easier in the near-term to simply copy/paste/modify your configuration, this introduces significant risk to your migration and your customers - we've already seen teams forget to update config for the new regions and spend a lot of time debugging the problem.\\n 633: \\n 634: To make your configuration region flexible, you should:\\n 635: 1. Refactor your business configuration to leverage \\\"natural parameters\\\" as the key instead of realm - i.e., the actual underlying key that the configuration is coupled to. E.g., replacing keys like `prod.USAmazon.ATVPDKIKX0DER.myKey` with `prod.*.ATVPDKIKX0DER.key` enables you to launch in new regions without having to touch your business configuration.\\n 636: 2. Name your technical configuration by convention going forward to minimize the configuration you need. E.g., consistently naming Odin material sets with region as a placeholder, like `\\\"prod.*.registry.materialSet = HorizontePlatform.GenericGiftRegistry.WeddingRegistry.wedding-hz-$REALM$\\\"` makes it so that you don't have to update this configuration value for any new regions so long as you continue to leverage the AWS region as the realm in new regions.\\n 637: \\n 638: To assist with this process, we provide workflows in [Ironhide](https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/ironhide/), a universal code transformation toolkit. Ironhide offers a set of transformations specifically designed to help refactor configurations and make them region-flexible. These transformations address critical region inflexibilities such as hardcoded region names, region-specific API endpoints, and data-center location assumptions that currently hinder service migration from mega-regions like DUB to new regions such as ZAZ and FRA. While Ironhide can significantly streamline the refactoring process, it's important to note that it may not cover all scenarios. Therefore, it's crucial to:\\n 639: \\n 640: - Use Ironhide's transformations as a starting point for your refactoring efforts\\n 641: - Review the changes made by Ironhide and ensure they align with your service's specific needs\\n 642: - Continue to follow the principles outlined in the rest of this lesson for any configurations not covered by Ironhide's transformations\\n 643: \\n 644: #### <ins>Lesson 3.4.1: Refactor Configuration with Ironhide</ins>\\n 645: \\n 646: [Ironhide](https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/ironhide/) is a universal code transformation toolkit. We have created a set of transformations to help refactor configurations and make them region flexible.\\n 647: \\n 648: These transformations address and reduce critical region inflexibilities — such as hardcoded region names, region-specific API endpoints, and data center location assumptions — that currently hinder service migration from mega-regions like DUB to new regions such as ZAZ and FRA. These automated workflows also help reduce configuration sprawl and standardization challenges by consolidating duplicate configurations across domains/realms, streamlining ARN resource management.\\n 649: \\n 650: By leveraging Ironhide's powerful automation and testing capabilities, these transformations improve deployment flexibility, reduce maintenance overhead, and future-proof services for regional expansion. They ensure reliability through built-in validation features. All transformations were pre-tested and reviewed by domain experts before being made available.\\n 651: \\n 652: ##### Installation:\\n 653: \\n 654: Ensure you're on a cloud desktop, and run\\n 655: \\n 656: ```sh\\n 657: toolbox install ironhide\\n 658: ```\\n 659: \\n 660: ##### Usage:\\n 661: Ironhide can be invoked if you provide either a version set and package(s), or the absolute path to an existing workspace.

Be careful when building out maps or using the += operator to ensure you see the expected results (more details [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BrazilConfigSyntax/#.27Operator_.2B.3D.27)).\\n1078: \\n1079: If you want to start using [Amazon Config Store](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/INTech/AmazonConfigStore/) (ACS) as you refactor your business configuration, check out the joint ACS and Region Flexibility training on [Making Your Configuration Region Flexible](https://learn.a2z.com/app/course/amzn1.c3.v2.c38d8fa6-3fb2-4f02-b9a0-ea407237bf84/).\\n1080: \\n1081: #### <ins>Lesson 3.4.3: Refactor technical configuration to be region flexible</ins>\\n1082: \\n1083: To align technical configuration with its \\\"correct\\\" keys, you should leverage the full AWS region as the realm in new regions (e.g., eu-south-2 for Spain/ZAZ). Find more details on why in our [realm recommendation wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Deep_Dives_and_Announcements/Deep_Dives/Realm_Recommendation/). And wherever possible, you'll want to name technical configuration by convention to minimize the amount of configuration required.\\n1084: \\n1085: Looking at the technical configuration examples from the prior lesson, here's what they may look like when made region flexible:\\n1086: \\n1087: ```\\n1088: prod.EUAmazon.ZeroesCommonsMonitoring.materialSet = \\\"com.amazon.access.SwordViewConfig-Prod-s3-full-access-monitor-eu-1\\\";\\n1089: \\n1090: incorporates eu-south-2 with\\n1091: \\n1092: prod.*.ZeroesCommonsMonitoring.materialSet = \\\"com.amazon.access.SwordViewConfig-Devo-s3-full-access-monitor-$REALM$\\\";\\n1093: ```\\n1094: \\n1095: ```\\n1096: prod.us-east-1.Dacia.sqs.arn = \\\"arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:723354600757:DaciaQueue\\\";\\n1097: \\n1098: incorporates eu-south-2 with\\n1099: \\n1100: # Note: This assumes the same AWS account is used across regions.\\n1101: prod.eu-south-2.Dacia.sqs.arn = \\\"arn:aws:sqs:eu-south-2:723354600757:DaciaQueue\\\";\\n1102: ```\\n1103: \\n1104: ```\\n1105: *.EUAmazon.MWS.url = “https://mws-eu.amazonservices.com/”\\n1106: \\n1107: incorporates eu-south-2 with\\n1108: \\n1109: # TODO: Once MWS is available in eu-south-2, update this URL.\\n1110: *.eu-south-2.MWS.url = “https://mws-eu.amazonservices.com/”\\n1111: ```\\n1112: \\n1113: At this time, RFE does not recommend changing realms in existing regions this way, as it is not a requirement for exiting DUB and time is a priority. If you choose to make this change, we  have a few recommendations for reducing the risk:\\n1114: 1. Make this change one region at a time.\\n1115: 2. Don't let the change linger, to reduce the likelihood of new configuration being introduced that your team members miss applying to both the new and legacy realms.\\n1116: 3. Use some of the commands outlined in this lesson to identify configuration tied to the legacy realm that is provided by other teams' libraries, which will require special handling.\\n1117: \\n1118: #### <ins>Lesson 3.4.4: Validate wildcard client configuration</ins>\\n1119: \\n1120: While wildcards (i.e., `*.*.<key>`) are desirable in business configuration, they can present a risk in technical configuration if the configuration value is not properly parameterized. Where wildcards are used in endpoint selection, for example, deployments will be successful, but services in new regions will then direct to an unintended endpoint, causing traffic to go to the wrong domain/stage or region (e.g., IAD gamma instead of ZAZ prod) or fail due to missing connectivity to that incorrect domain/stage and region. Make sure to review the qualifiers you pull in (e.g., using the commands earlier in this module) to ensure traffic will be routed to the right place.\\n1121: \\n1122: Example: A team set their realm to eu-south-2, and got to the point where their service successfully started up, which they thought meant all their dependencies were either ready in eu-south-2 or had configuration pointing back to DUB. But when they got confusing errors, they ultimately found this configuration:\\n1123: \\n1124: ```\\n1125: *.*.BSFSRHttpConnectionInfo.LocalizationMetadataServiceBSF = {\\n1126:     path = \\\"/\\\";\\n1127:     server = \\\"lms-bsf-na-master.amazon.com\\\";\\n1128:     port = 7777;\\n1129: };\\n1130: ```\\n1131: \\n1132: To fix it, the team had to add new configuration values for this key for eu-south-2.\\n1133: \\n1134: \\n1135: #### <ins>Lesson 3.4.5: Validate your configuration changes</ins>\\n1136: \\n1137: {{info}}\\n1138:  **Make sure to validate!**  \\n1139: It is critical to validate your configuration changes. Different brazil-config parsers function differently, as highlighted in the [general brazil-config guidance](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BrazilConfigFAQ#How_do_wildcards_in_keys_work.3F) - e.g., the Java and the Python parsers may interpret wildcards-based paths differently. Compare your existing EUAmazon config output looks consistent by leveraging some of the commands provided below.\\n1140: {{/info}}\\n1141: \\n1142: To help you understand what config values need to be updated, the following command can be used to find all brazil-config files containing EUAmazon that your service pulls in. You can substitute your DUB realm in for EUAmazon to make this work for your service if you use a different realm. After performing the refactor, you can run the command with the new realm (eu-south-2 for ZAZ) to compare results. Note: this outputs the configuration that will be deployed in the Apollo environment at runtime, not considering any overrides you set in the Apollo environment itself. It may reflect configuration that is unused, and will not reflect any configuration only used for testing.\\n1143: \\n1144: ```\\n1145: find `brazil-path run.configfarm.brazil-config` -not -type d | \\\\\\n1146:   xargs -I{} -i grep -l -i euamazon {}  | \\\\\\n1147:   xargs -I{} readlink -f {}\\n1148: ```\\n1149: \\n1150: Once you know what config files are relevant, you can either look at them individually, or modify the above command to get the exact entries with the realm in them:\\n1151: ```\\n1152: find `brazil-path run.configfarm.brazil-config` -not -type d | \\\\\\n1153:   xargs -I{} -i grep -i euamazon {}\\n1154: ```\\n1155: \\n1156: To get the full picture of what configuration is loaded in for a particular domain and realm, you can leverage a command like the following after replacing the `<>` with the appropriate variables. The output will include `*.*` and `domain.*` configuration that isn't shown with the other commands.

The absence of updated IP ranges in the policy creates blockers for services like Timber, Odin, S3 and DynamoDB. While temporary workarounds, like removing users from the DragonIPAllowlisting group, have resolved immediate issues, this is not a scalable solution.\\n1204: Proactive updating of IP allowlisting policies for new regions and establishing a monitoring process for dependencies can prevent such disruptions.\\n1205: \\n1206: #### Guide to Handle DragonIPAllowlistingPolicy Issues\\n1207: \\n1208: 1. **Identifying the Issue**\\n1209: \\n1210:     1. **Error Symptoms**: AccessDeniedException errors in logs or cloud trails for IAM users performing actions in the ZAZ region.\\n1211:     1. **Common Errors**:\\n1212:         1. Explicit Deny in identity-based policy.\\n1213:         1. CloudTrail events showing unrecognized sourceIP.\\n1214:     1. **Example Logs**:\\n1215: \\n1216:         ```\\n1217:         User: arn:aws:iam::651706746811:user/IsaFanout is not authorized to perform: dynamodb:CreateTable\\n1218:         ```\\n1219: \\n1220:         ```\\n1221:         failed: Timber returned an error: Error Code: AccessDenied, Error Message: You are not authorized to perform this operation, HTTP code: 403\\n1222:         ```\\n1223: 1. **Solution**\\n1224: \\n1225:     1. **Step 1**: Remove the impacted IAM user from the DragonIPAllowlisting IAM permission group.\\n1226:         1. Go the AWS IAM console \\n1227:         1. Click on User Groups under Access Management \\n1228:         1. Click on the DragonIPAllowlisting IAM user group \\n1229:         1. Under the \\\"Users in this group\\\", select the IAM users and click on \\\"Remove Users\\\" \\n1230: \\n1231:     1. **Step 2**: Verify if removing the user mitigates the error. This is a short-term solution to unblock the resource access.\\n1232: \\n1233: **Why removal is safe?**\\n1234: \\n1235: Removing this policy will NOT break production applications. It will mean that credentials in your system if compromised could be used for IP ranges other than Amazon's amorphous \\\"prod network\\\". After removing the DragonIPAllowlisting policy, the path forward is to move your authentication from IAM user to IAM roles rather than relying on a fictional network boundary for security. To move your application to IAM roles, please follow the Turtle onboarding guide - https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AWSAuth/Projects/HOSMEverywhere/TurtleOnboarding/\\n1236: \\n1237: \\n1238: \\n1239: ### Lesson 3.7: CDKv2 Migration\\n1240: \\n1241: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this lesson, your service will be migrated to CDKv2 to avoid deployment errors in ZAZ.\\n1242: \\n1243: \\n1244: ### Why CDKv2 Migration\\n1245: \\n1246: Services utilising CDKv1 will encounter critical deployment challenges during regional expansion, primarily manifesting as \\\"no KMS key present for bucket deploymentbucket\\\" errors due to region synchronisation issues. While upgrading the `@amzn/pipeline` package to its latest version offers a solution, this upgrade necessitates a comprehensive migration to **CDKv2** since newer versions of `@amzn/pipeline` are predominantly CDKv2-compatible. This technical debt highlights the importance of maintaining updated CDK versions and dependencies, as it directly impacts the service's ability to expand smoothly across AWS regions. As a prerequisite to regional expansions, service team should prioritise CDKv2 migration to prevent deployment failures. (example: [Ticket](https://t.corp.amazon.com/D208974370/communication) with AWS team regarding deployment failure).\\n1247: \\n1248: You will see the following example error if your pipeline is in CDKv1 and is deploying to new region like ZAZ:\\n1249: \\n1250: **Sample Error:**\\n1251: \\n1252: > Failed to create CloudFormation target arn:aws:cloudformation:eu-south-2:840864613710:stack/CloudAuthStack-gamma-ZAZ: no KMS key present for bucket deploymentbucket-4764c841f7cff9887e497174ea1ee807d319b483 in region eu-south-2\\n1253: \\n1254: <pre>\\n1255: This AMZN::ContinuousDeployment::Pipeline resource is in a UPDATE_FAILED state.\\n1256: Caused by: Com::amazon::Buildertools::Cdservice::InvalidParameterException:\\n1257: The EditPipelineAsync operation failed: Status: FAILED\\n1258: Error Type: com.amazon.buildertools.cdservice.InvalidParameterException\\n1259: Additional Details: Workflow [workflow id: 3251990, run id: 236fhGUy0J46jZ4CIxU2LsFwZcjkyGsKTG0somw7DPO/8=] failed.\\n1260: Reason: com.amazon.buildertools.cdservice.InvalidParameterException: Couldn't add sub-target to Deployment Group\\n1261: target us-west-2:3251990:SEACXCdk-gamma-ZAZ: Invalid parameter when creating CDCloudFormationService target\\n1262: with the error message: '<b>Failed to create CloudFormation target arn:aws:cloudformation:eu-south-2:840864613710:stack/CloudAuthStack-gamma-ZAZ:\\n1263: no KMS key present for bucket deploymentbucket-4764c841f7cff9887e497174ea1ee807d319b483 in region eu-south-2</b>',\\n1264: metadata 'CloudFormationTargetDescription(super=TargetMetadata()...\\n1265: </pre>\\n1266: \\n1267: To fix Missing KMS key for deployment bucket issue, you need to upgrade `@amzn/pipelines`.

As we uncover and establish guidance for other areas of risk, they will be added to this milestone.\\n1306: \\n1307: \\n1308: \\n1309: ## Module 4: Data Recipe Identification\\n1310: \\n1311: > **_GOAL:_** For this module, we will help you identify the cross-region data accessibility recipe that best fits your use case for each dataset you own, or identify risks where no pre-defined recipes align with your use cases.\\n1312: \\n1313: *Note:  Based on the number of impacted datasets, we prioritized creating recipes for Sable, DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.  We will add recipes for SQS, SNS, OpenSearch, and ElasticSearch by the end of 2024. If you need to identify your data strategy ahead of that timeline or you need support for different data stores, reach out to us at [#region-flex-data-migrations](https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C06QBBQALSD).*\\n1314: \\n1315: Data has historically been co-located in-region with the services that use it, which provided fast and reliable access. As we migrate to new regions, we will need to leverage new data access patterns as we migrate, replicate, and cache our data across regions. By the end of this module, you will identify your data stores, pick a data accessibility strategy, and either identify the right recipe or let us know if you can't find a recipe for your use case so that we can assist.\\n1316: \\n1317: As you navigate your recipe selection, consider the following:\\n1318: 1. Do you need this data? Deleting data is easier than moving it or accessing it cross-region.\\n1319: 1. How frequently do you use this data? Infrequently accessed data may be easier to migrate independently of associated services, simplifying your migration.\\n1320: 1. Can you easily recreate this data? If so, instead of a migration, you can build up your data in the destination region and then clean it up in the source region.\\n1321: 1. How much down-time can your application tolerate?  If you can tolerate downtime, your migration will take less effort and less calendar time.\\n1322: 1. How much added latency can your application tolerate? If you can tolerate latency, you can start by calling back to data sets instead of migrating or replicating them across regions. But keep in mind that you will ultimately need to move the data to the destination region.\\n1323: 1. Does your application require access to strongly consistent data? Migrating strongly consistent data requires significantly more effort than migrating eventually consistent data (e.g., weeks vs days).  Don’t rely simply on the API calls your application makes (e.g., ConsistentRead parameter set to “True” for DynamoDB’s GetItem API calls); make every attempt to see if your application can tolerate eventually consistent data access to simplify your migration.\\n1324: \\n1325: At a high level, you will follow one of these strategies:\\n1326: * **Keep data in the source region**: You can use this approach 1) if your service can tolerate the cross-region WAN latency, 2) for data at rest, and 3) for infrequently-used data. We discourage this approach for frequently-used data and for this use case, we ask teams to use it only for temporary experimentation or if a tool is not available to migrate/replicate your data store.\\n1327: * **Replicate your data**: Replicating data makes sense when you have eventually consistent data access and you run your service stacks in both the source and destination regions. Homepage is an example of a sub-experience that will replicate data because each marketplace typically uses the datasets and the same services and only some marketplaces are migrating in 2025. A big consideration to data replication is the traffic on the WAN, which will be aligned with your current write traffic on that data store.\\n1328: * **Recreate your data in the destination region**: When you use this approach, you will not initially migrate or replicate any data from the source region but will instead re-create it in the destination region over time. This approach is suitable if you have infrequently used data with a retention policy. This approach will require an update to your service to obtain historic data from the source region; however, this approach differs from the “Create a data cache in the destination region” approach (below) because you will not write this data to the destination region.\\n1329: * **Create a data cache in the destination region**: We currently don’t have tooling that can fully support this approach so service changes will likely be required. For this approach, you will replicate only new writes to your source datastore (which is supported by our current tooling). However, to access existing data, you would obtain it from the source region and then write it to the destination region for future use (requiring service changes). This approach is suitable if your historic dataset is not frequently used.\\n1330: * **Migrate your data**: You will typically use this approach for strongly consistent data sets, when you are certain that the data is not required in the source region, or when you can tolerate the cross-region latency from the source region to the destination data store. As you migrate your data, you will need to switch all traffic associated with this data store to the new region. This is typically the most complex data movement approach, but it mitigates your exposure to WAN link degradations.\\n1331: \\n1332: You know your data best, but we recognize these are new questions most teams haven’t had to work through before. If you have any questions or need any guidance, please contact us on Slack at [#region-flex-data-migrations](https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C06QBBQALSD).\\n1333: \\n1334: ### Lesson 4.1: Identify Your Data Stores\\n1335: \\n1336: > **_GOAL:_** After completing this lesson, you should have identified the data stores in scope for your migration.\\n1337: \\n1338: First, you need to identify the data stores you depend on. This includes the data stores owned or managed by your service, as well as any data stores owned by others that you access or are triggered by.\\n1339: \\n1340: If you're reading this page from the [Region Flex Portal](https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/), you have the ability to include data stores that should be a part of your migration plan.  On the RFP main page, you can create a brand new migration plan, or select an existing plan to edit.  As you progress through the wizard, you will have the opportunity to add datasets associated to the service you're migrating.\\n1341: \\n1342: Alternatively, you can start with [Managed Migration Experience (M2X) Discovery](https://console.m2x.amazon.dev/) for Sable, DynamoDB, S3, RDS, and SQS data stores. The default view will provide the data stores that you have access to through your bindles; however, you can navigate your organization by inserting someone else’s alias in the “View as” textbox in the upper righthand side. For other data stores, you will need to manually review all the resources owned by the AWS account numbers that are either owned by or have permissions to your pipelines.\\n1343: \\n1344: A good starting point to find your AWS account numbers is from [https://pipelines.amazon.com/pipelines/<your-pipeline-name>](https://pipelines.amazon.com/pipelines/your-pipeline-name) to see which account numbers your pipelines use for deployment. You can also download your [IMR monthly statements](https://cerberus.cloudtune.amazon.dev/usage) for your fleet;  your statement will list the datastores you are using along with the AWS account numbers.\\n1345: \\n1346: \\n1347: ### Lesson 4.2: Identify Your Recipes\\n1348: \\n1349: > **_GOAL:_** After completing this lesson, you should have identified the recipe associated with each of your data stores\\n1350: \\n1351: Now that you've identified your data stores, it's time to figure out what recipes they map to. We have recipes available for [Sable, DynamoDB, S3, RDS, SQS, SNS, OpenSearch, and ElasticSearch](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/DataMovementRecipes/). For Sable, Dynamo, and S3, [Region Flex Portal](https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/) has integrated with the M2X Accelerator for a semi-automated guided migration experience.\\n1352: \\n1353: If you don't find a recipe that meets your use case, this presents a risk to your migration.  Please reach out to us on Slack at [#region-flex-data-migrations](https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C06QBBQALSD).\\n1354: \\n1355: # Migration Milestone 1: Set up your infrastructure\\n1356: \\n1357: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this milestone: Your service is set up and verified to be minimally operational.\\n1358: \\n1359: \\n1360: \\n1361: ## Module 5: Prepare your AWS accounts\\n1362: \\n1363: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this module, your AWS account will be setup for the new region.\\n1364: \\n1365: In this module, we will cover how to set up your AWS account with hardware, permissions, and appropriate quotas to support your code\\n1366: \\n1367: ### Lesson 5.1: Creating New AWS Accounts\\n1368: \\n1369: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this lesson, you will have your new AWS account(s) ready for the new region, if necessary.\\n1370: \\n1371: #### <ins>Lesson 5.1.1 Determining your account granularity</ins>\\n1372: \\n1373: 1. DynamoDB Global Tables does not support cross-account replication of data. As a result, services which use Global Tables for data replication will do so within a single account, and both the primary (DUB) and replicated (ZAZ) tables will be in the same account.\\n1374: 2. For tier 1 services, it is best practice to have a per-aws-region account strategy (where technically viable). DynamoDB Global Tables is a situation where a single AWS account for both primary (DUB) and replicated (ZAZ) tables, as a per-aws-region account strategy is not technically viable; therefore, teams will create replicas in multiple regions using the same account.\\n1375: 3. With all AWS regions contained within the European Union (including DUB, ZAZ, and FRA), this is an acceptable structure to support the migration of data.\\n1376: 4. This only affects account structure and does not affect the overall need to review migration of data with legal if there are concerns with whether moving the data is acceptable.\\n1377: 5. For services which use Global Tables in a single account, the services have two options for other regional infrastructure:\\n1378:     1. The preferred option is to build other infrastructure (compute, etc) in a separate account, with cross-account access used to access DyanamoDB.\\n1379:     2. If the first option is not feasible for some reason, teams can build other infrastructure supporting the second region in the same account.  Please weigh the risks of this approach such as operator safety and account limit sharing between multiple regional stacks.\\n1380: 6. For smaller migrations, especially migrations from DUB to only one region, it is a viable strategy for services migrating to ZAZ to use Global Tables to move data, build the ZAZ infrastructure in the same account, shut down the DUB infrastructure, change the DDB Global Table primary table, and effectively convert the same account from single-region-DUB to single-region-ZAZ.\\n1381: 7. In the case of some managed compute technologies, new compute may be automatically placed in new accounts. For example, [HEX-AWS](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/HEX/HEX-AWS/HEX-AWS-Path-Forward/) does not support same account for AWS resources. In these cases, this will restrict services which also use Global Tables to option 5(a) above.\\n1382: 8. DynamoDB is expected to launch Cross-Account Global Tables in Q3-2025, at which point, this issue will be resolved going forward. Please note that it is possible that Security and CRRE, at some future date, may instruct teams to maintain separate accounts.\\n1383: \\n1384: #### <ins>Lesson 5.1.2 Creating the account</ins>\\n1385: \\n1386: If you do decide you need a new account, there are two ways RFE recommends doing it:\\n1387: \\n1388: ***With Replicator:***\\n1389: \\n1390: For services utilizing _Replicator_, you will have the option to create new AWS accounts when generating new Tardigrade endpoints. You may re-use these new accounts to put the rest of your stage-specific AWS resources.\\n1391: \\n1392: ***Without Replicator:***\\n1393: * Go to the [Conduit Website](https://conduit.security.a2z.com/).\\n1394: * Open the left Navigation Menu, and select \\\"Create New Account\\\" menu item.\\n1395: * Follow the Wizard steps to create the new account.\\n1396: \\n1397: \\n1398: ### Lesson 5.2: AWS Limitations and Requests\\n1399: \\n1400: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this lesson, your AWS limits/quotas in the destination region will match those in the source region.\\n1401: \\n1402: \\n1403: {{warning}}\\n1404:  If you are utilizing Replicator, then Replicator will have prompted you to sync the AWS Service Quotas already. If not using Replicator or need to sync another AWS account, then follow the instructions below.\\n1405: {{/warning}}\\n1406: \\n1407: Some teams need to override limits/service quotas for various AWS services. As you start to leverage a new region and potentially a new account, you want to make sure that account has equivalent limits/quotas set compared to the source region to avoid running into issues at scale that are difficult to find in testing.\\n1408: \\n1409: ### Service Quota Syncer\\n1410: AWS Service Quotas Syncer ([demo here](https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/1358675)) is an RFE tool that is available via CLI for all service types. It is strongly recommended to utilize this automation to reduce effort.\\n1411: \\n1412: ##### <ins> Step 1: Give Service Quotas Sync CLI the necessary permissions in source and target accounts</ins>\\n1413: \\n1414: In order to execute Service Quotas Sync CLI,  please follow the instructions provided on the [Service Quotas Syncer Permissions](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Factorio/Replicator/FAQ/#HServiceQuotasSyncerPermissions).\\n1415: \\n1416: #### <ins> Step 2: Get the Quota Sync tool from gitfarm\\n1417: First, you will need to pull the package. From your DevDesktop:\\n1418: \\n1419:         brazil workspace create --name FactorioResourceReplicatorCLI && cd FactorioResourceReplicatorCLI\\n1420:         brazil workspace use --package FactorioResourceReplicatorCLI -vs FactorioResourceReplicator/development\\n1421:         brazil-build clean && brazil-build\\n1422: Then, you will need to export the stage:\\n1423: \\n1424:         export STAGE=prod\\n1425: \\n1426: Then, run the CLI command to compare and begin syncing quotas between the source AWS account and region to the target AWS account and region. It will return a `request-id` that you should save for later progress tracking.\\n1427: \\n1428:         brazil-runtime-exec replicator servicequotas compare -sr <SOURCE-REGION> -sa <SOURCE-ACCOUNT> -tr <TARGET-REGION> -ta <TARGET-ACCOUNT>\\n1429: \\n1430: An hourly scheduled lambda will pick this and start processing by raising quota increase requests\\n1431: The latest status of the requests can be found as follows:\\n1432: \\n1433:         brazil-runtime-exec replicator servicequotas status -id <request-id>\\n1434: \\n1435: #### <ins> Step 3: Follow up for AWS manually-reviewed requests\\n1436: Not all quota requests will be automatically approved. You may receive email notifications to the AWS account email's address with requests for additional information from AWS customer support regarding your quota request. Navigate into the AWS console and reply back to the case so that customer service can continue to process your request. Once the case is closed the Service Quota Syncer will automatically run again to process additional quota requests.\\n1437: \\n1438: ### Manually\\n1439: \\n1440: #### View your AWS Service limits/quotas\\n1441: \\n1442: To view the quotas provided by default, choose one of the following options:\\n1443: \\n1444: * Open the [Service endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-service-information.html) page in the documentation, search for the service name, and click the link to go to the page for that service. To view the service quotas for all AWS services in the documentation without switching pages, view the information in [PDF form](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/general/latest/gr/aws-general.pdf) instead.\\n1445: * Open the [Service Quotas Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home), In the navigation pane, choose **AWS services** and select a service.\\n1446: * Alternative: Use the [list-service-quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/service-quotas/list-service-quotas.html) and [list-aws-default-service-quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/service-quotas/list-aws-default-service-quotas.html) AWS CLI commands.\\n1447: \\n1448: ### Additional Resources\\n1449: \\n1450: **Need help**, contact [AWS Plus Technical Account Managers(TAMs)](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Plus/tams/).\\n1451: For detailed information about increasing the AWS service limits, see:\\n1452: \\n1453: 1.

Several teams, including InfoSec, create and depend on these attributes to meet security, compliance, and availability requirements. Missing or incorrect attributes can lead to critical issues for your service in new regions. Ensure all newly created AWS accounts are properly tagged by following [this runbook](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Icon/rfm/runbooks/AWSAccountAttributesReplication).\\n1489: \\n1490: In the future, Replicator will:\\n1491: \\n1492: * Update configurations (BrazilConfig, JLBRelay, etc...)\\n1493: * Add your new apollo environment to your existing pipeline\\n1494: \\n1495: **Replicator for NAWS pipelines**\\n1496: \\n1497: Replicator will scan your non-Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) AWS account and generate a CDK leveraging Alkimia. If you are using LPT to manage your pipeline(s) and would like to move to CDK, you can use Replicator. If you would like to still remain on LPT, you can use [this AWS tool to generate IaC for your resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/generate-IaC.html).\\n1498: \\n1499: **Target Customers**\\n1500: \\n1501: * **Use-case 1:** Users with an AWS account not linked to a pipeline and want to convert resources to CDK.

Here is a high-level overview of how you might do it, using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).\\n1682: \\n1683: There are two types of policies: [AWS Managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies) and [Customer Managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#customer-managed-policies) IAM Policies.\\n1684: \\n1685: You do not need to copy AWS Managed Policies from one account to another, as they are already available in all AWS accounts. If you need to attach AWS Managed Policies to users, groups, and roles in the new account, you can simply do so by referencing them by their ARN (Amazon Resource Name), which remains consistent across all AWS accounts.\\n1686: \\n1687: _AWS Managed Policies_  \\n1688: To find out what managed policies are attached to specific users or roles in your source region, you can use the AWS Management Console or AWS Command Line Interface(CLI).\\n1689: \\n1690: AWS Management Console\\n1691: \\n1692: 1.

Make sure the users or roles listed in your source account exists in your new account.\\n1707: 1. Attach the managed policies to users, groups, or roles that you discovered to the users in the new account following the steps below with commands like the following.\\n1708: \\n1709: ```\\n1710: aws iam attach-user-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdminstratorAccess --user-name<user-name>\\n1711: ```\\n1712: \\n1713: ```\\n1714: aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess --role-name<role-name>\\n1715: ```\\n1716: \\n1717: ```\\n1718: aws iam attach-group-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess --group-name<group-name>\\n1719: ```\\n1720: \\n1721: _Customer Managed Policies_\\n1722: \\n1723: 1. List policies in the Source Account by typing \\\"**aws iam list-policies --scope Local**\\\" command to get a list of all the custom IAM policies in the source account.\\n1724: 1. For each policy listed by the previous command, use \\\"**aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn <policy_arn> --version-id <version_id>**\\\" to get the policy document. Replace **<policy-arn>** with the ARN of the policy and **<version_id>** to get the policy document.\\n1725: 1. For each policy document retrieved from the source account, verify if there are any specific source account ARNs mentioned in the `Resource` section of each policyDocument's statement(s).\\n1726: \\n1727:   1. The below example illustrates a specific source account ARN being used in the `Resource` section.\\n1728: \\n1729: ```\\n1730:     {\\n1731:         \\\"Version\\\": \\\"2012-10-17\\\",\\n1732:         \\\"Statement\\\": [{\\n1733:             \\\"Sid\\\": \\\"Statement1\\\",\\n1734:             \\\"Effect\\\": \\\"Allow\\\",\\n1735:             \\\"Action\\\": [\\n1736:                 \\\"dynamodb:PutItem\\\"\\n1737:             ],\\n1738:             \\\"Resource\\\": [\\n1739:                 \\\"arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:390xxxxxxxx:table/AuditTable\\\"\\n1740:             ]\\n1741:         }]\\n1742:     }\\n1743: ```\\n1744: \\n1745:   1. While replicating/copying this policy to the target/destination AWS account, we have to ensure that the ARN present in the `Resource`(key) value should be the target AWS account, as shown below.\\n1746: \\n1747: ```\\n1748:     {\\n1749:         \\\"Version\\\": \\\"2012-10-17\\\",\\n1750:         \\\"Statement\\\": [{\\n1751:             \\\"Sid\\\": \\\"Statement1\\\",\\n1752:             \\\"Effect\\\": \\\"Allow\\\",\\n1753:             \\\"Action\\\": [\\n1754:                 \\\"dynamodb:PutItem\\\"\\n1755:             ],\\n1756:             \\\"Resource\\\": [\\n1757:                 \\\"arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:<destination-aws-account>:table/AuditTable\\\"\\n1758:             ]\\n1759:         }]\\n1760:     }\\n1761: ```\\n1762: 1. Please modify such ARNs by replacing the source AWS account id with destination AWS account id. For each of your updated policy documents retrieved from the source account, use the \\\"**aws iam create-policy --policy-name <policy_name> --policy-document <file://><path_to_policy_json>**\\\" command in the destination account to create the policy. Replace **<policy_name>** with the name you want to give the policy in the new account and **<path_to_policy_json>** with the path to the JSON document containing the policy.\\n1763: 1. You can automate this process by writing a script that loops through each policy, retrieves it, and then creates it in the new account.\\n1764: 1. Note: Before you create the new policy in the destination account, ensure AWS CLI is configured with the destination account credentials \\\"**policy_name=$(echo $policy | cut -d '/' -f 2)**\\\"\\n1765: \\n1766: Ensure you have the necessary permissions in both the source and destination accounts.

This has led to confusion about how to test new regions.\\n1796: The following table provides recommendations on where your devo corp environment should run, using the DUB to ZAZ + FRA migration as the example use case.\\n1797: \\n1798: | My current alpha and/or beta environment is... | Recommendation |\\n1799: | --- |  --- |\\n1800: | One environment in PDX | Keep using your existing environment as is. |\\n1801: | Three environments in PDX corp, one for testing each region | Keep using your existing environments as is. |\\n1802: | One environment in PDX, but I need to test cross-region functionality | Keep using your PDX environment and set up a second devo environment in IAD to test cross-region functionality.<br><br>Leverage the new realm recommendation for this new IAD environment. |\\n1803: | One environment each in PDX, IAD, and DUB corp | Continue using your DUB environment for testing the traffic that will now go to ZAZ + FRA.<br><br>It's recommended to switch to the new realm recommendation (i.e., eu-west-1) for the devo DUB environment. This will be better aligned with your ZAZ + FRA environment's configuration, increasing what you get out of the test environment.<br><br>Plan to eventually utilize only PDX and IAD in corp. |\\n1804: \\n1805: **Wait...I can keep my devo environments in DUB?**\\n1806: For now yes, if they're already there.

If utilizing gamma is not viable in the near-term, you will need to create additional stacks in PDX for each new realm.\\n1814: \\n1815: **What if I'm building a new service?**\\n1816: Build the service region flexibly, so that it can serve test traffic for any region. Then run your devo corp environment in PDX, with IAD added as needed to test cross-region functionality.\\n1817: \\n1818: **What's the long-term plan for devo?**\\n1819: As services become region flexible, they will be able to take any test traffic in any region, and we expect to consolidate down to two devo environments per service.

Note that if Odin is used for storing credentials, each material set can only be assigned to a single region.\\n1993: - Note If your ZAZ/FRA environment is in an AWS account created after July 29 2024, follow Monitor Webservice’s [onboarding guide](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/MonitoringWebService/Docs/MWSAuthorization/OnboardingGuide#HIhaveanewaccountinNAWSandusingMetricAgenttopublishmetrics.WhatistheminimumchangeIneed3F) to provision permission for PMET metric publishing before this certificate is in the path of any traffic, otherwise you will get a sev2 like [this](https://sim.amazon.com/issues/V1668892088) once your NAWS compute boots up.\\n1994: \\n1995: **Recommended Golden Path**: The easiest and safest way to create your certs and Odin Materials for the ZAZ region is to **create a new endpoint for ZAZ**. For example, if you have ServiceName.DUB.Amazon.com as your endpoint in DUB, create a new endpoint like ServiceName.ZAZ.Amazon.com for ZAZ. This will allow you to test their new service through the ZAZ endpoint, and this endpoint can then either be used by clients directly, or used through re-direct from DUB→ZAZ. Once you create a new endpoint, you can request a certificate for this new endpoint in Redfort and ACM, which will be delivered as a new Odin Material Set. Remember, in Redfort, you can only create one certificate per endpoint, and only one Odin material set associated with the certificate. So, if you have an Odin Material Set already for DUB, you cannot create one for ZAZ. And although you may be able to get two Odin Material Sets for DUB and ZAZ through ACM, it’s a long an arduous task, so we ask to create a separate endpoint for safe and clean cert assignments.\\n1996: \\n1997: #### Lesson 7.5.1: Create Odin Material Sets\\n1998: {{warning}}\\n1999:  If you are utilizing Replicator, then Replicator will have prompted you to replicate your Odin MaterialSets already. If not using Replicator or replicating additional Odin MaterialSets then follow the instructions below.\\n2000: {{/warning}}\\n2001: \\n2002: ZAZ is an opt-in region for Odin. This means that Odin material sets for ZAZ cannot be shared with other regions such as DUB. Teams must create new material sets to use for ZAZ (this will also be true for all future regions SDO expands to, and is true for AWS teams as well). The Odin UI no longer supports creating new material sets, however, creation through the [Odin Admin CLI](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Odin/Admin/Reference/) is supported.\\n2003: \\n2004: For teams with a business critical need to share material sets between DUB and ZAZ (i.e., sharing encryption keys that need to be usable in multiple regions), there is an exception process to allowlist material sets for IAD/DUB/PDX as well as ZAZ. Note that these exceptions are only approved after the use case is validated that your team is unable to use separate material sets. File a Ticket [here](https://t.corp.amazon.com/create/templates/68a184c6-ea59-4e23-920b-29d446d4f030) with your exception requests.\\n2005: \\n2006: Note: The Odin team no longer supports creating new material sets via the Odin UI (<https://odin.amazon.com/.>) See below for how to create new material sets using the Odin CLI:\\n2007: \\n2008: 1. You need the OdinTools Apollo env on your Cloud Developer Desktop to use the Odin CLI. Check your Dev Desktop pipeline to see if you already have it. If not, see <https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Odin/Admin/Reference/InstallCLI/>\\n2009: 1. Use this Odin doc reference for how to use the Odin CLI to create a new material set: <https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Odin/Admin/Reference/CreateMaterialSetAWSBindles>\\n2010:     1. If you get an \\\"AccessDeniedException\\\" error message when creating the material set, it means you do not have access to create the material set under that Odin namespace.\\n2011:     1. You can either update your permissions in Bindles for \\\"Odin Namespace Permissions\\\" and make sure you have permission \\\"Can create material set under Odin Namespace\\\", or you can create a new Odin namespace to use for your new Odin material set.\\n2012:     1. If your existing material set is in Odin namespace ``com.amazon.access``, you will need to use your own Odin namespace because ``com.amazon.access`` is reserved for the Conduit team.\\n2013:     1. Use this Odin doc reference for how to use the Odin CLI to create a new namespace: <https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Odin/Admin/Reference/ReserveNamespace>\\n2014:     1. Use `-nf` for newFeature (new region). This will trigger a review via [Consensus](https://consensus.a2z.com/) that your direct manager will have to approve.\\n2015: 1. If your Odin material set contains AWS credentials for an IAM User in your Conduit-managed AWS account, please follow the steps to have Conduit periodically rotate your credentials: <https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/ACMF/CloudAccessManagementPermissions/Features/CredentialRotation/>\\n2016:     1. Note that Amazon Security is planning to have teams migrate off long-lived AWS credentials, such as IAM Users, and have teams migrate to short-lived AWS credentials like IAM Roles directly or IAM Roles in Turtle. So if you are using IAM Users you should plan that you'll have to migrate off IAM Users in 2024/2025 and onto IAM Roles. You can ignore this bullet if you are using the Odin material set for something other that AWS credentials.\\n2017:     1. Note: Do not request an exeption/allowlist for Odin material sets that are IAM Users. The solution is to create another IAM User, and then use the new IAM User material set for ZAZ-only (or even better, switch to using IAM Roles).\\n2018: \\n2019: #### Lesson 7.5.2: Create Certificates\\n2020: For general best practices and guidance refer to the link [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Certificates).\\n2021: In Amazon, there are two certificate management products: Redfort and ACM(AWS Certificate Management). SDO teams are welcome to use either one of these.\\n2022: \\n2023: To create certificates for ACM, follow the instructions in [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/ACM/Internal/Onboarding).\\n2024: \\n2025: {{info}}\\n2026:  To use an ACM certificate with Amazon CloudFront, you must request or import the certificate in the US East (N. Virginia) region. ACM certificates in this region that are associated with a CloudFront distribution are distributed to all the geographic locations configured for that distribution as mentioned [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-regions.html).\\n2027: {{/info}}\\n2028: \\n2029: {{warning}}\\n2030:  If you are utilizing Replicator, then Replicator will have prompted you to replicate\\n2031: {{/warning}}\\n2032: your Redfort certificates already.

CloudAuth verifies client access permissions before issuing tokens.\\n2039: \\n2040: To add an endpoint:\\n2041: \\n2042: -   Identify service endpoints\\n2043: -   In [AAA website](https://aaa.amazon.com/) > My Services > {Your Service Name} > Modify CloudAuth Endpoints\\n2044: -   Input HTTPS endpoints\\n2045: -   Select deployment region and authentication method\\n2046: \\n2047: ### Lesson 7.6: Setup Proxies (CDORelay, BigMesh, AWSSSLProxy)\\n2048: \\n2049: > **_GOAL:_** After completing this lesson, you will have set up your proxies.\\n2050: \\n2051: \\n2052: {{warning}}\\n2053:  This section focuses on services on MAWS that are using either CDORelay, BigMesh, or AWSSSLProxy.  If this does not apply to you, you can mark this lesson as Not Applicable and skip it. \\n2054: {{/warning}}\\n2055: \\n2056: This lesson outlines the manual process to onboard your proxy (CDOReplay, BigMesh, AWSSSLProxy) in a new region. We expect that you are already using a proxy and the same configuration will be replicated in new region. The following is the guideline to setup proxy in a new region, and is separated into two parts,\\n2057: 1. Identification of the underlying proxy technology\\n2058: 1. The corresponding onboarding steps\\n2059: \\n2060: #### Lesson 7.6.1 Identifying the underlying proxy technology\\n2061: \\n2062: The following sections describe how to identify if your service uses that particular proxy technology.  Once you confirm which technology you're using, proceed to the next lesson for the specific migration steps.\\n2063: \\n2064: ##### CDO Relay\\n2065: \\n2066: CDORelay (v1) is based on JLBRelay. It will only ever be offered as a consumable environment. It is written in RUST. CDORelay relies on jlbrelay.cfg for configuration. CDORelay offers TLS termination, maxConns-based load shedding, and health check management. V1 does everything you need for simple CloudAuth-compatible TLS termination.\\n2067: \\n2068: 1. Go to your service pipeline https://pipelines.amazon.com/pipelines/<Pipeline_Name>\\n2069: 1. Check if “CDORelayConsumable/Release/Prod” is present in the “ConsumedEnvs”.\\n2070: 1. If present that means service is using JLBRelay/CDORelay V1 as proxy.\\n2071: 1. For future reference if you need to edit relay configuration, please see the following file located at brazil-config folder (configuration > brazil-config > override > JlbRelay.cfg).\\n2072:     * Example of [JlbRelay.cfg](https://code.amazon.com/packages/FCPickDemandService/blobs/mainline/--/brazil-config/override/JlbRelay.cfg)\\n2073: \\n2074: ![Look for CDORelay in your consumable environments](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/setup_proxies/CDORelay_Consumable_Env.png)\\n2075: \\n2076: ##### BigmeshProxyRuntime (CDORelayV2)\\n2077: \\n2078: CDORelay V2 is an SDO-compliant application. It is accessible as a consumable environment and is developed using the Go programming language (GoLang). CDORelayV2 can use jlbrelay.cfg for configuration, but also offers a simpler bmruntimeproxy.cfg file that is easier to manage. CDORelayV2 was created so that SDO could add extensions for SDO-specific network behaviours that JLBRelay would never support. For example V2 offers Noise Gate (a load shedder that uses OPF headers to prioritize human traffic over bots/etc). V2 has native support for CloudAuth and Midway and also offers simpler server-side integration with BigMesh Load Balancer (also known as BigMesh Router, or SLR).\\n2079: \\n2080: Both CDORelayV1 and CDORelay V2 are currently in place in tier-1 services across Amazon. If you only need TLS termination then either will work.\\n2081: \\n2082: ![Understanding BigMesh Proxy connections and ports](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/setup_proxies/BigMesh_Operation.png)\\n2083: \\n2084: 1.

If present that means service is using CDORelay/JLBRelay V2 as proxy.\\n2087: 1. For future reference if you need to edit relay configuration, please see the following file located at brazil-config folder (configuration > brazil-config > override > BMRuntimeProxy.cfg or inside brazil-config/override/ directory).\\n2088:     * Example of [BMRuntimeProxy.cfg](https://code.amazon.com/packages/A9AdsWebServiceKannadiServer/blobs/mainline/--/configuration/brazil-config/override/BMRuntimeProxy.cfg)\\n2089: \\n2090: ![Look for CDORelay2 in your consumable environments](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/setup_proxies/CDORelayV2_Consumable_Env.png)\\n2091: \\n2092: ##### AWS SSL Proxy\\n2093: \\n2094: AWSSSLProxy is a software daemon that is intended to be running on the same host (or container) as your application. If you are already using a different method for Midway Authentication, then you do not need AWSSSLProxy.\\n2095: \\n2096: The AWSSSLProxy will listen on the normal ports (HTTP/80 and HTTPS/443), perform TLS termination, and perform Midway authentication. Once authenticated, the AWSSSLProxy will make a HTTP request to localhost on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1) with the original incoming request along with a special X-Forwarded-User header indicating the Midway identity of the requester.\\n2097: \\n2098: The application software will listen on a different port (e.g. HTTP/8080) and only accepts incoming requests that originate from the localhost.\\n2099: \\n2100: 1. Check if you are using AWSSSLProxyCurrent package in runtime dependency\\n2101: 1. Check if you are using AWSSSLProxy/AWSSSLProxyConsumable as consumable environment.\\n2102: 1. Check if you are using AWSSSLProxyConfig package in runtime dependency\\n2103: 1. If any of the above matches that means service is using AWSSSLProxy\\n2104: 1. AWS SSL Proxy configuration must be present in the apollo opconfig config package in the brazil-config folder (configuration > brazil-config > override > eg. opconfig.cfg\\n2105:     * Example of [opconfig.cfg](https://code.amazon.com/packages/AMSDetectiveService/blobs/mainline/--/configuration/brazil-config/global/opconfig.cfg)\\n2106: \\n2107: #### Lesson 7.6.2 Onboard proxy\\n2108: \\n2109: Now that you've identified the proxy technology being used, start by referring to see if the prerequisites have been satisfied and then refer to the appropriate section to see the detailed onboarding steps.\\n2110: \\n2111: ##### Prerequisites\\n2112: \\n2113: 1. Load balancer setup in new region should be completed. This will used to test the setup end to end (request travelling from original endpoint to service host).\\n2114: 1.

Setup Odin Material (host with chain) - Add host class and user of ZAZ environment\\n2118: \\n2119: ##### CDO Relay\\n2120: \\n2121: In order for CDORelay to work, we need to have JLBRelay config file set up. This config sets up max conns, listening ports, and health checks. Normally we have one config file that uses domain and realms to distinguish settings.\\n2122: \\n2123: 1. Once relay config file is identified, check realm identifiers with `EU` prefix configuration in the file, like `EUAmazon`, `EUFulfillment`\\n2124:    * Example of config with `EUAmazon` https://code.amazon.com/packages/CROWCoralService/blobs/mainline/--/brazil-config/override/JlbRelay.cfg\\n2125:    * Example of config with `EUFulfillment` https://code.amazon.com/packages/FCPickDemandService/blobs/mainline/--/brazil-config/override/JlbRelay.cfg\\n2126: 1. You may find multiple entries for single environment such as HTTP, HTTPS, ClouthAuth, Tardigrade (without CIP), tardigrade (with CIP).\\n2127: 1. You need to **replicate** the following configurations from `EU` identifiers and **append** them for `eu-south-2`.\\n2128: 1.

SDO (Stores, Digital & Other Finance), in partnership with AWS, CloudTune and Region Flex teams, will offer ‘IMR Relief’ for parallel holding costs to incentivize migration from DUB to ZAZ. This IMR Relief will provide a one-time DARU credit at the individual fleet level by negating the actual IMR cost incurred in ZAZ during the planned migration window. The offsetting DARU charge will be applied at the Parent F2 level. Participating fleets will also have credit score relief for the duration of the migration. Note that DUB to ZAZ migrations can be submitted at any point during the 2024 planning year in APD (or during 2024 OP2 planning cycle 10/25-11/17) but cannot be backdated. For more information check the [CTF wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Consumer_Tech_Finance/CTF_Team/CTF_IMR/WW_Stores_2024_IMR_Planning/#H4PlanningforRegionFlexMigration28DARU2FRFE29).\\n2961: \\n2962: For 2025 IMR costs associated with Region Flex migrations, SDO finance is committed to provide a one-time credit (up-to 12 weeks) for parallel holding and data transfer costs. The process will be finalized and published at the end of November 2024. For more details, see the [Stores wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Consumer_Tech_Finance/CTF_Team/CTF_IMR/WW_Stores_2024_IMR_Planning/#H4PlanningforRegionFlexMigration28DARU2FRFE29)  or the [Digital and Other wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/D&S-FP&A/User-Guides/Amazon-Device-AWS-Infrastructure-Expense-Management/D&O-2024-DARU-IMR-Relief/).\\n2963: \\n2964: Note: The maximum credit relief per Source-Target resource combination is 12 weeks.\\n2965: \\n2966: ## Module 8: Prepare for your service for cross-region latency\\n2967: \\n2968: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this module, you will have taken steps to mitigate availability risks caused by increased inter-service communication latencies.\\n2969: \\n2970: \\n2971: {{warning}}\\n2972:  We have noticed an increase in latency for services dependent on G2S2. [See example ticket](https://t.corp.amazon.com/V1657949902/overview).\\n2973: {{/warning}}\\n2974: \\n2975: As teams make their service stacks in new regions production-ready at different times, service owners need to be ready for situations where cross-region calls replace some in-region calls. A key implication is increased latency of communication: same-region network round-trip-times (RTT) are typically below 1ms, while cross-region network RTTs are 10s of milliseconds; for example, the DUB-ZAZ RTT ranges from 35ms to 65ms (see more detail [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/FAQs/#HHowwillservicelatencybeimpactedduringthemigration3F)). Your service may be affected if its direct dependency migrates so that your calls go cross-region; it may also be affected if a call made by your transitive dependency becomes cross-region (even if all calls your service makes stay in-region). Higher latency may lead to timeouts either in your service, or its dependencies. It may also increase CPU load. Prepare your service by following the lessons in this module. You can read more background in [this wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Timeouts).\\n2976: \\n2977: \\n2978: ### Lesson 8.1: Ensure your service has availability alarms in new regions\\n2979: \\n2980: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this lesson, you will have ensured that your team is aware when your new service stack is impaired.\\n2981: \\n2982: You can use monitor portal to replicate your MAWS service alarms (Pmet & Carnaval) across different AWS regions with just a few clicks. This feature is available on RFP under **Lesson 8.1: Ensure your service has availability alarms in new regions**.\\n2983: Otherwise, you can use the stand-alone tool [here](https://prod.replicator.tools.amazon.dev/monitor-replication/plans).\\n2984: \\n2985: Ideally, your service already has availability alarms. If your service has them in classic SDO regions (e.g. DUB), then copy the availability percentage alarms from the classic region to the new regions.\\n2986: \\n2987: Note: If the migration from a classic region (e.g. DUB) to a new region (e.g. ZAZ) involves the retirement of any APIs of your service then it’s OK not to copy those APIs’ availability monitors.\\n2988: \\n2989: If your service has no availability alarms in classic SDO regions, then please add them in new SDO regions first, and consider adding them in classic SDO regions as well (although RFE does not require you to).\\n2990: \\n2991: If in doubt about alarm configuration, then please —\\n2992: \\n2993: 1. Consult [guidance from CRRE on how to measure availability](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Consumer/ReliabilityEngineering/Guidance/#HAvailabilityMetricMeasurement).\\n2994: 2. Unless you know better, RFE recommends —\\n2995:     1. To use CDK infrastructure-as-code to define the new alarms; see [the BuilderHub manual](https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/native-aws/developer-guide/cdk-monitoring/).\\n2996:     2. To cut a Sev-2 ticket when 99% or less of all *valid* requests to a Prod endpoint are served successfully.\\n2997:     3. To use 1-minute metrics for alarming.\\n2998:     4. To alert when 3 consecutive data points are at or below the threshold.\\n2999:     5. To alert on missing data points.\\n3000:     6. To return the alarm to “OK” when 3 consecutive data points are above the threshold.\\n3001: 3. If still in doubt, consult with your tech lead or [#region-flexibility](https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C05D7C8PVDY).\\n3002: \\n3003: \\n3004: ### Lesson 8.2: Ensure your service has dependency call metric dashboards\\n3005: \\n3006: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this lesson, you will have reduced the time it takes to localize service impact to timeouts or other failures in calls to dependencies.\\n3007: \\n3008: When your on-call is paged because your service is impaired, they would need to check whether the impact is correlated with failures in dependency calls, and more specifically, whether timeout values may need to be adjusted. To enable that —\\n3009: \\n3010: 1. Your service should publish enough metrics to check whether calls to a specific dependency are failing and whether that’s caused by timeouts.\\n3011: 2. The metrics should be displayed on a dashboard that’s available and known to employees that have on-call duties for your service.\\n3012: \\n3013: For each endpoint that your service calls you should be able to see the following metrics (or their equivalents) —\\n3014: \\n3015: 1. Call latency: Time between starting a call (sending a request) and ending it (either receiving a response, timing out, or encountering an I/O or protocol error). Your dashboards should show the 99th percentile (p99) of latency; they can show lower and higher percentiles as well.\\n3016: 2. Call success: The percentage of calls attempted by your service that succeed (0%-100%).\\n3017: 3. Call timeout: The percentage of calls attempted by your service that time out (0%-100%).\\n3018: \\n3019: Notes:\\n3020: \\n3021: 1. We don’t recommend you alarm on these metrics; instead prefer to alarm on service-level indicators (SLIs) like your service’s availability. You can learn more about SLIs on the [CRRE SLI wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Consumer/ReliabilityEngineering/SLI).\\n3022: 2. We recommend to measure call success and call timeout separately because timeouts occurring in a service that your service invokes may manifest themselves to your service as non-success responses (e.g. HTTP status 500) rather than timeouts. It’s important to have both metrics to localize problems faster.\\n3023: 3. We recommend to measure call *success* rate rather than call *failure* rate because it makes the metric easier to test, easier to alarm on (if needed), and is consistent with common standard metrics (e.g. in Coral). Having said that, measuring call failure rate is sufficient to complete this lesson.\\n3024: \\n3025: **Exceptions**\\n3026: \\n3027: It's OK to skip following this recommendation for calls to endpoints that are *guaranteed* to remain in the same region as your service and whose latency will not be affected by cross-region migrations. These include —\\n3028: \\n3029: 1. In-region AWS service endpoints (excluding DynamoDB endpoints which your service uses to access tables planned to be migrated using [Hotwire](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Hotwire); Hotwire adds latency during migration).\\n3030: 2. In-region SDO storage service endpoints: Sable, Verto, G2S2 (excluding Sable endpoints which your service uses to access scopes that are planned to be migrated using Hotwire).\\n3031: \\n3032: Examples:\\n3033: \\n3034: |If your ZAZ or FRA stack is calling...\\t|Should you ensure dashboarding of call metrics?\\t|\\n3035: |---\\t|---\\t|\\n3036: |Some other service's LRA endpoint\\t|yes\\t|\\n3037: |Some other service's ZAZ/FRA/DUB endpoint\\t|yes\\t|\\n3038: |AWS service endpoint in a different region\\t|yes\\t|\\n3039: |AWS DynamoDB endpoint in same region (your team might use Hotwire for migrating data)\\t|yes\\t|\\n3040: |Sable endpoint in same region (your team might use Hotwire for migrating data)\\t|yes\\t|\\n3041: |AWS DynamoDB endpoint in same region (your team will definitely not use Hotwire for migrating data)\\t|no*\\t|\\n3042: |Sable endpoint in same region (your team will definitely not use Hotwire for migrating data)\\t|no*\\t|\\n3043: |AWS service (not DynamoDB) in the same region\\t|no*\\t|\\n3044: |Verto or G2S2 in the same region\\t|no*\\t|\\n3045: \\n3046: [*] While there is not a region flexibility benefit in adding these metrics, they will improve your team's operational posture by accelerating root cause identification should these calls fail, and you should consider adding them.\\n3047: \\n3048: **Implementing using Axon metrics**\\n3049: \\n3050: [Axon](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Axon) is an observability tool that lets service owners discover and monitor their callers and dependencies (callees). Your service is already onboarded to Axon if it was onboarded to [Convoy](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AutoAug/Convoy) (see Module 2 of this guide). Axon provides the *call latency* metric automatically. The following sections describe other ways of ensuring you have all the call metrics we recommend.\\n3051: \\n3052: The fastest way to check whether your service has Axon, is to open [the Axon UI](https://axon.ops.amazon.dev/service-graph) and search for the name of one of your environments (for example, [Axon page for Detail Page EU Prod](https://axon.ops.amazon.dev/service-graph/HorizontePlatform/Detail/EU/Prod)). If you onboarded to Axon (including creating the PrivateLink required for NAWS services) and yet don’t find your environments in Axon UI, it may be because the relevant code changes haven’t been deployed yet.\\n3053: \\n3054: If your service is on Axon, then it publishes call latency metrics to MWS with `metricclass=$CLIENT_TELEMETRY$`. For example, [ProductDeliveryExperienceAggregatorService/EU/Prod CLIENT_TELEMETRY Latency p99](https://monitorportal.amazon.com/igraph?SchemaName1=Search&Pattern1=marketplace%3D%24eu-west-1%24%20dataset%3D%24Prod%24%20servicename%3D%24ProductDeliveryExperienceAggregatorService%2FEU%2FProd%24%20metricclass%3D%24CLIENT_TELEMETRY%24%20schemaname%3DService%20methodname%3D%24ProductDeliveryExperienceAggregatorServiceEU.ProductDeliveryExperienceAggregatorService.GetProductDeliveryInformationSummary%24%20metric%3D%28NOT%20_ERROR%24%29&Period1=OneMinute&Stat1=p99&ValueUnit1=millisecond&HeightInPixels=250&WidthInPixels=600&GraphTitle=ProductDeliveryExperienceAggregatorService%2FEU%2FProd%3A%20CLIENT_TELEMETRY%20Latency%20p99&DecoratePoints=true&StartTime1=-PT3H&EndTime1=-PT0M&FunctionExpression1=S1&FunctionLabel1=%7BmetricLabel%7D%20%5Bavg%3A%20%7Bavg%7D%5D&FunctionYAxisPreference1=left) displays the 99th percentile of latency that ProductDeliveryExperienceAggregatorService experiences when it calls Axon-visible dependencies.\\n3055: \\n3056: You can include the Axon latency metric in your service's new regional dashboards (ZAZ, FRA). If your service already publishes sufficient call metrics on its own, then we don't ask you to change your dashboards to display Axon metrics; we only suggest using Axon metrics to potentially reduce your effort.\\n3057: \\n3058: **Implementing using Coral metrics**\\n3059: \\n3060: For calls made using [CoralClient](https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/coral/user-guide/ref-coral-javaclient), ensuring that CoralClient metrics are published by your service to either MWS or CloudWatch (and displayed on a dashboard) would be enough to meet our recommendation, because it implements the following metrics —\\n3061: \\n3062: 1. Call latency: `metric=Latency` ([wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Coral/Metrics/Common#Latency))\\n3063: 2. Call success: `metric=Availability:Critical` ([wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Coral/Metrics/Common#Availability:Critical))\\n3064: 3. Call timeout: `metric=Timeout:Critical` ([wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Coral/Metrics/Common#Timeout:Critical))\\n3065: \\n3066: If you're using CoralClient but don't see these metrics for some of your Coral dependencies, please ensure that your code is passing a CoralMetrics `Metrics` object to the client call.

Once you got an answer to your question, we encourage you to contribute the answer back into this guide, by cutting a SIM [here](https://sim.amazon.com/issues/create?template=e508fcab-0d4d-4989-b473-f4f37b760955).\\n3092: \\n3093: **Note on REST-style service calls**\\n3094: \\n3095: If your service is calling a REST-style service and accesses different URLs for different business use cases with substantially different latency profiles (e.g. `GET /customer/benefit/-/` to determine benefit eligibility is fast; `GET /customer/profile/-/` to get the customer’s full profile is slow) then we recommend to publish separate call metrics for each. We’re calling out REST in particular, because CoralClient provides separate metrics for each operation “out of the box”.\\n3096: \\n3097: \\n3098: ### Lesson 8.3: Prepare configuration for cross-region latency\\n3099: \\n3100: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this lesson, you will have taken action to prevent some problems due to client configuration settings.\\n3101: \\n3102: **Remove `maxConnectionsPerHost` and `maxTotalConnections` settings from Coral configuration files**\\n3103: \\n3104: Coral configuration allows defining upper limits on how many connections one client host may open against a service (`maxTotalConnections`) or how many connections it may open against one server host (`maxConnectionsPerHost`).\\n3105: We recommend you remove assignments to those configuration keys in client configuration packages that your team owns.\\n3106: \\n3107: ```\\n3108: BarService#Base.DUB.Prod : {\\n3109:    \\\"httpEndpoint\\\" : {\\n3110:      \\\"url\\\" : \\\"https://prod.barservice.dub.amazon.com:443\\\"\\n3111:    },\\n3112:    \\\"httpClient\\\" : {\\n3113:      \\\"maxConnectionsPerHost\\\" : 30, // remove this line\\n3114:      \\\"maxTotalConnections\\\" : 30    // remove this line\\n3115:    }\\n3116:  }\\n3117: ```\\n3118: \\n3119: **Why?** When your service’s dependency’s latency increases (either due to it moving behind a cross-region link or some of its dependencies doing the same) that is likely to increase the number of concurrently open connections, which will increase the likelihood of hitting one of these limits. Coral team advises its customers to instead rely on [Automatic Admission Control](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Coral/Campaigns/AutomatedAdmissionControlCampaign) to prevent overload, rather than on arbitrary limits that will become outdated once there are changes in the latency profile of the callee or the scaling of the caller.\\n3120: \\n3121: **Ensure Coral `connectionTimeout` is 500ms or more, if explicitly set**\\n3122: \\n3123: Coral configuration allows setting an upper bound on how much time it takes to establish a secure HTTP connection from the client to the server, via the `connectionTimeout` key. We recommend you ensure this timeout value is at least 500ms.\\n3124: \\n3125: ```\\n3126: BarService#Base.DUB.Prod : {\\n3127:    \\\"httpEndpoint\\\" : {\\n3128:      \\\"url\\\" : \\\"https://prod.barservice.dub.amazon.com:443\\\"\\n3129:    },\\n3130:    \\\"httpClient\\\" : {\\n3131:      \\\"connectionTimeout\\\" : 200 // increase this to 500\\n3132:    }\\n3133:  }\\n3134: ```\\n3135: \\n3136: If your Coral configuration files do not set `connectionTimeout` then **don’t add it**. Coral’s default value is 2500ms which already meets our recommendation.\\n3137: \\n3138: **Why?** When we use HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 with TLS for client-server communication, it takes 3 round-trip times (RTTs) to establish a secure connection before any application request can be sent. In order to prepare for your dependencies’ endpoints to be on the other side of a cross-region network path, your connection timeouts should be at least 3x of the maximum RTT. For Exit DUB, the three regions at play are DUB, ZAZ and FRA; among them, the longest RTT is 65ms, so 3x of that is 195ms. Allowing 100ms for server-side processing of each communication leg gives us a round 500ms lower bound on connection time.\\n3139: \\n3140: **Notify your callers if you made changes**\\n3141: \\n3142: If you made any changes in this lesson, we recommend that you notify the owners of packages consuming your client configuration package, to give them the opportunity to re-run stress tests for the services that use the configuration. You can find CTIs to cut tickets to as follows — \\n3143: \\n3144: 1. Use Code Search to find packages consuming your configuration package; for example [this search query](https://code.amazon.com/search?term=fp%3AConfig+status%3Aactive+%22MarketplaceDeliveryPromiseServiceClientConfig+%3D+1.0%22) finds consumers of `MarketplaceDeliveryPromiseServiceClientConfig-1.0`.\\n3145: 2. For each identified package — \\n3146:     1. Navigate to the Permissions tab, and click on the Bindle link.\\n3147:     2. On the Bindle page, click on “See more” to see the CTI for the Bindle.\\n3148: \\n3149: Make sure to include the URL of the commit with the changes in the ticket, so that consumers know what changes you’re referring to and can ensure to have merged from them from live before re-running tests.\\n3150: \\n3151: \\n3152: ### Lesson 8.4: Ensure your run-book can help your on-call change call timeout values\\n3153: \\n3154: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this lesson, you will have made your run-book helpful when your on-call needs to change a timeout value.\\n3155: \\n3156: We recommend that you edit your team’s runbook to include code links that would help an on-call increase call timeout values when necessary, without spending time researching which service configurations or code hold these values. Below we list some of the ways call timeouts could be set; please note that it’s not exhaustive.\\n3157: \\n3158: **Changing CoralClient configuration**\\n3159: \\n3160: If a service is using CoralClient to call BarService, it usually consumes default operation timeout settings via the BarServiceCoralConfig package that’s vended by the BarService team; looking, for example, like this —\\n3161: \\n3162: ```\\n3163:  BarService#Base.DUB.Prod : {\\n3164:    \\\"httpEndpoint\\\" : {\\n3165:      \\\"url\\\" : \\\"https://prod.barservice.dub.amazon.com:443\\\"\\n3166:    },\\n3167:    \\\"timeouts\\\" : {\\n3168:      \\\"operationTimeouts\\\" : {\\n3169:        \\\"BarService/*\\\" : 5000,\\n3170:        \\\"BarService/GetBeer\\\" : 750\\n3171:      }\\n3172:    }\\n3173:  }\\n3174: ```\\n3175: \\n3176: If your service becomes unhealthy due to timeouts calling a particular Coral service, you will need to adjust the operation timeout value your service uses to make that call, and deploy the resulting code changes. In the most common case, your service consumes that value from the dependency team’s package; thus to change the value without involving that team (which will take precious time), you will need to add an *override configuration file* to your service package; like this —\\n3177: \\n3178: ```\\n3179:  // YourService/configuration/coral-config/BarService-override.config\\n3180:  BarService#Base.DUB.Prod : {\\n3181:    \\\"timeouts\\\" : {\\n3182:      \\\"operationTimeouts\\\" :+ {\\n3183:        \\\"BarService/GetBeer\\\" : 1500\\n3184:      }\\n3185:    }\\n3186:  }\\n3187: ```\\n3188: \\n3189: **Changing programmatic call timeout settings**\\n3190: \\n3191: Your service may be setting call timeouts programmatically (not via a configuration file). The following subsections cover a few common HTTP client libraries. Edit your run-book to include links to code locations where those timeout values are set, so that they may be found quickly during an incident. If your service uses client software not listed below and you’re not sure how to adjust dependency call timeout values, please ask your teammates or [#region-flexibility](https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C05D7C8PVDY).

E.g., if you deploy to one region per pipeline stage today, you should add the new regions as new stages adjacent to the source region. However, while you’re working on getting the new regions set up, the pipeline stages may need to be placed elsewhere in the pipeline to accelerate your iteration speed. \\n3215: \\n3216: | If my current pipeline... | Then my new stages for ZAZ and FRA should... |\\n3217: | :-------- | :---------- |\\n3218: | Deploys to one region in each pipeline stage | Each be placed in its own new pipeline stage next to your existing DUB stage(s). <br /><br /> Deploy to one region at a time and utilize [Accelerated Releases](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CraneCD/AcceleratedReleases/StoresRegional/) to accelerate iteration speed while developing. <br /><br /> Be labeled as production stages once ready for production. | \\n3219: | Deploys to multiple regions in the same pipeline stage AND approves each region with DIFFERENT approval workflows\\t| Be placed in the same pipeline stage as your existing DUB stage(s). <br /><br />Utilize [Accelerated Releases](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CraneCD/AcceleratedReleases/StoresRegional/) to accelerate iteration speed while developing.<br /><br />Be labeled as production stages once ready for production. |\\n3220: | Deploys to multiple regions in the same pipeline stage AND approves all those regions with the SAME approval workflow\\t| Be placed at the start of your pipeline while iterating on getting the regions ready. <br /><br />Be moved to the same pipeline stage as your existing DUB stage(s) and labeled as production stages once ready for production.|\\n3221: \\n3222: ### Lesson 9.2: Accelerate your pipeline\\n3223: \\n3224: > **_GOAL:_** After completing this lesson, you should understand how workflows are applied to Accelerated Releases.\\n3225: \\n3226: Pipelines has provided a new feature called \\\"Dynamic Releases\\\". This allows you to accelerate changes to ZAZ while you are setting up the region, ensuring it gets changes quickly and doesn't block the rest of the pipeline. Regardless of where ZAZ is in your pipeline, it will always deploy to ZAZ first. Additional details on this feature and step by step guidance can be found [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CraneCD/AcceleratedReleases/StoresRegional/).\\n3227: \\n3228: ### Lesson 9.3: Add the ZAZ Region to your pipelines\\n3229: \\n3230: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this lesson, you should have the ZAZ region set up as a new stage in your pipelines.\\n3231: \\n3232: #### Lesson 9.3.1: Add the ZAZ region to your LPT pipelines\\n3233: \\n3234: {{warning}}\\n3235:  Please follow this step if your service is on LPT otherwise this can be skipped.\\n3236: {{/warning}}\\n3237: \\n3238: Update your pipeline to incorporate each new pipeline stage you're adding for the new region, incorporating equivalent testing workflows for the new region that you have in existing regions.\\n3239: \\n3240: If your service uses any LPT pipelines, please refer to the [general builderhub step-by-step guidance provided here](https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/mrc/user-guide/infrastructure-pipelines-one-touch/).

But we will provide examples of how you can also do this in the following guide.\\n3253: \\n3254: ***Add a new stage***\\n3255: \\n3256: 1. Open your existing CDK package for your pipeline, open your app's entry point (**lib/app.ts** if you used BuilderHub Create)and add the following code.\\n3257: \\n3258: 2. **Construct and file names**\\n3259:     > This code example assumes that you have a stack called **InfraStack** defined in **lib/infraStack.ts**. If your stack and file have different names, replace them accordingly to your setup.\\n3260:     > In this code example, we use **beta** for the additional pipeline stage's name. You are free to choose a different name, but be aware that some libraries may expect specific stage names to function properly. For example, ApolloShimOpConfigHelpers only accepts **alpha, beta, gamma, and prod** by default.\\n3261:     > If you already have a CloudFormation stack with the name **Username-Infra-beta-us-west-2** in **us-west-2** region, choose a different name.\\n3262: \\n3263:     ![1705363375394-327.png](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/add_the_zaz_region_to_your_cdk_pipelines/1705363375394-327.png)\\n3264: 3.

Once the pipeline deployment completes, you should see a new beta stage on your pipeline.\\n3275: \\n3276: ***Add a new region to an existing stage***\\n3277: \\n3278: Adding a new region to your beta stage is similar to adding [a new stage to the pipeline](https://builderhub.corp.amazon.com/docs/native-aws/developer-guide/cdk-howto-expand-pipeline.html#cdk-pipeline-add-new-stage). The main difference is that you don't need to create a new DeploymentGroupStage object via the pipeline.addStage() method. Instead, you will reuse the betaStage object.\\n3279: \\n3280: 1. Open your app's entry point and add the following code for the second region of the beta stage.\\n3281: \\n3282:     ![1705363643076-738.png](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/add_the_zaz_region_to_your_cdk_pipelines/1705363643076-738.png)\\n3283: \\n3284: 2.

You should already have these, but take this time to check and add them if not.\\n3323: * **Workflow step alarm**: Indicates a workflow step has failed or timed out. Look up your pipeline's Carnaval alarms, if you have workflow step alarms for other regions, create an equivalent alarm in the same manner as your existing ones for the new region.\\n3324: \\n3325: Before you can act on an alarm, you must create a Carnaval monitor.\\n3326: \\n3327: 1. Go to the **Notifications** tab and click **Create a monitor** next to the alarm you want to monitor (you will be taken to a Carnaval page)\\n3328:     1. The Carnaval page is automatically populated with the alarm rule, name, pipeline owner, and the notification e-mail for your pipeline. \\n3329: 2. Update the fields with exactly the type of alerts or emails you want when your workflow step fails. Note that newly created monitors will always start in an OK state\\n3330:    <div align=\\\"center\\\">\\n3331:      <img src=\\\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/add_update_carnaval_alarms/1705364786447-277.png\\\" alt=\\\"add_update_carnaval_alarms/1705364786447-277.png\\\">\\n3332:    </div>\\n3333:    \\n3334: 3. Carnaval will start tracking the state of the alarm after the monitor has been created. If an alarm is in ALERT state when you create the monitor, you can set the correct state in Carnaval manually to match the state displayed in Pipelines.\\n3335: 4. After the monitor gets created, the notification page will link to it.\\n3336: \\n3337: Note: When possible, consider temporarily disabling alarming (e.g., emitting tickets, sending notifications) until it is needed closer to launch. Doing so could reduce the avoidable operational burdens that come with misfired tickets.\\n3338: \\n3339: \\n3340: ### Lesson 9.5: Multi-Region Metric Monitoring in MAWS and NAWS Services\\n3341: \\n3342: > **_GOAL:_** By end of this lesson, you will understand how to distinguish and monitor your service's metrics across multiple AWS regions during migration.\\n3343: \\n3344: #### Define Your Service’s Region In Its Metrics\\n3345: {{warning}}\\n3346:  If you are migrating a MAWS service and utilizing Replicator, then Replicator will have completed this step for you. It’s important to still review this page to have an understanding of why and how your service is changing.\\n3347: {{/warning}}\\n3348: \\n3349: During your service’s migration from DUB (eu-west-1) to ZAZ (eu-south-2), your service will temporarily operate from both regions until 100% of your traffic is shifted to ZAZ. During this migration phase you will need to monitor your service in _both_ regions. Currently, your service’s metrics will not help distinguish which region they are originating from as this is not something that was previously required. By the end of this section, your service’s instances will be able to append their region to their metrics, helping you distinguish which region they are coming from.\\n3350: \\n3351: Without region-based metrics, it will not be possible to differentiate changes in latency or error rates between an existing instance of a service in DUB and a new instance of the same service in ZAZ as the metrics from both would appear as part of a single region-less service. While each instance is unique, the published metrics from all service instances are aggregated together without differentiation of where they are coming from, making it impossible to distinguish the metrics of one instance from another.\\n3352: \\n3353: To avoid breaking existing metrics and alarms in established regions, it's crucial to implement these changes only for new regions outside of DUB, IAD, and PDX. This approach ensures continuity for existing services while enabling region-specific monitoring for new deployments. Always test these changes thoroughly in a non-production environment before implementing them in production.\\n3354: \\n3355: #### MAWS\\n3356: \\n3357: When setting up monitoring for MAWS services, it is required you include the AWS Region of where your stack is deployed in the metrics each stack publishes. As part of region migration, if a metric can be emitted from more than one AWS Region, it is _required_ that the metric include the region of the environment of where it was created. By doing this, you can pinpoint exactly which region your service is facing issues in, easily compare data between stacks, and create tighter per-region alarms rather than larger cross-region ones. Please follow one of the approaches below in order to achieve this.\\n3358: \\n3359: * ***NOTE***: These changes should only be applied to new regions where your service will operate. Implementing these changes in your existing regions will break your current alarms and dashboards. \\n3360: \\n3361: \\n3362: #### NAWS\\n3363: \\n3364: When setting up monitoring for NAWS services publishing to CloudWatch, it's important to note that CloudWatch metrics include a region attribute by default. As part of multi-region deployment or migration, service owners should ensure they leverage this built-in region information when creating aggregated dashboards.\\n3365: \\n3366: It's important to remember that while CloudWatch automatically includes region information, adjusting how you view or aggregate these metrics in your dashboards may require updates to your existing monitoring setup. We recommend reviewing and potentially updating your dashboards and alarms to fully utilize the region-specific data available in CloudWatch, ensuring you maintain comprehensive visibility across all regions where your service operates. The approaches below are strictly for MAWS services. Please utilize CloudWatch in order to include your service's region in its metrics.\\n3367: \\n3368: \\n3369: #### How Do I Monitor Both of My Stacks?\\n3370: \\n3371: ##### A High-Level Overview of MetricAgent\\n3372: \\n3373: Although there are many different ways to publish metrics to MWS (see [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/PayStation_Routing_Authority_Service/PMET_vs_CW/#:~:text=box%20batching%20support.-,4.2.4%20Comparison%20between%20Agents%20in%20CloudWatch%3A,-Criteria)), the following example utilizes MetricAgent, which is the recommended choice by the Monitoring team for MAWS services.\\n3374: \\n3375: [MetricAgent](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/MonitoringTeam/MetricAgent/) is a tool that gathers metrics, [generated by Coral Metrics](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Coral/Metrics), from service logs. It then aggregates them and publishes them once a minute to CloudWatch and / or [Monitoring Web Service](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Monitoring/Documentation/MonitoringWebService/):\\n3376: \\n3377: ![Diagram](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/multi_region_metric_monitoring/metric_agent_overview_2.png)\\n3378: \\n3379: 1. A service can begin writing their metrics into a **QueryLogFile** (normally denoted **service_log** or **query_log**) through the usage of **Coral Metric Reporters**. Note that services are not required to use Coral in order to utilize the Coral Metrics library.\\n3380: 1. The written metrics are then read by MetricAgent from the **QueryLogFile** and published to MWS and/or CloudWatch.\\n3381: \\n3382: The approach below demonstrates how to integrate your service's region into an existing dimension of the service schema. Once added, MetricAgent can publish your service's metrics along with its region to Monitoring Web Services.\\n3383: \\n3384: ### If the marketplace field on your DUB metrics included \\\"EUAmazon\\\"\\n3385: \\n3386: **When using Apollo**: by updating the realm to be the full region name (e.g., eu-south-2) in your PubSub OpConfig as recommended elsewhere in this guidance, the marketplace field should automatically change to the region name (assuming you didn't have any particular overrides).\\n3387: \\n3388: **When using ApolloShim:** Use \\\"REPLACE_REGION\\\" in ApolloShim's PubSub OpConfig set.\\n3389: \\n3390: Additional documentation on Apollo Shim:\\n3391: \\n3392: * [apollo-shim.json documentation](https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/apollo/user-guide/howto-apollo-shim-for-code-deploy/#apollo-shim-json-documentation)\\n3393: * [ApolloShimOpConfigHelpers README.md](https://code.amazon.com/packages/ApolloShimOpConfigHelpers/blobs/mainline/--/README.md)\\n3394: \\n3395: \\n3396: \\n3397: ### If the marketplace field included more specific details, like the country code (e.g., \\\"DE\\\")\\n3398: \\n3399: In this case, you'll likely want to keep the marketplace field as-is and overload the DataSet dimension using Monitoring.TSD using the following steps. By the end of this section, your service will be appending its AWS Region, the region where your stack is running, to the DataSet dimension of its metrics.\\n3400: \\n3401: DataSet often lets service owners see which environment their metrics are coming from, sometimes including the stage. For example, the default value of DataSet is “Prod”, indicating that this metric is from the service’s Prod environment.\\n3402: \\n3403: Example:\\n3404: \\n3405: |BEFORE\\t|DataSet\\t|Marketplace\\t|HostGroup\\t|Host\\t|ServiceName\\t|MethodName\\t|Client\\t|MetricClass\\t|Instance\\t|Metric\\t|\\n3406: |---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|\\n3407: |\\t|Prod\\t|. . .\\t|ALL\\t|ALL\\t|RFEShellDiversMAWSLitmusService3\\t|ALL\\t|ALL\\t|NONE\\t|NONE\\t|Latency\\t|\\n3408: \\n3409: |AFTER\\t|DataSet\\t|Marketplace\\t|HostGroup\\t|Host\\t|ServiceName\\t|MethodName\\t|Client\\t|MetricClass\\t|Instance\\t|Metric\\t|\\n3410: |---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|\\n3411: |\\t|Prod:eu-south-2\\t|. . .\\t|ALL\\t|ALL\\t|RFEShellDiversMAWSLitmusService3\\t|ALL\\t|ALL\\t|NONE\\t|NONE\\t|Latency\\t|\\n3412: \\n3413: In the example above, DataSet includes \\\"eu-south-2\\\" which correctly reflects the AWS Region where the service runs. The DataSet dimension must always include your AWS Region, even if this information appears in other dimensions.\\n3414: \\n3415: * Marketplace is shown as \\\". . .\\\" since its value varies by team. For guidance on appropriate Marketplace values for your specific use case, please refer to our [Realm usage documentation](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Deep_Dives_and_Announcements/Deep_Dives/Realm_Recommendation/). TL:DR- your Marketplace in the new region should *not* be your service’s realm value (e.g. EUAmazon) unless switching it becomes too disruptive for your service.\\n3416: \\n3417: \\n3418: ##### Monitoring.TSD\\n3419: \\n3420: [Monitoring.TSD](https://apollo.amazon.com/operational_configuration.html?setId=371) is a set that can be added to your service’s Operational Configuration that allows you to directly modify the DataSet value that is published to MWS.\\n3421: \\n3422: ![OP Config Set](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/multi_region_metric_monitoring/op_config_set.png)\\n3423: \\n3424: \\n3425: This set has two attributes: **PerformanceStreamDestination** and **PerformanceStreamDataset**. By default, **PerformanceStreamDataset** will change your service’s Dataset value to \\\"**Prod\\\"** if this attribute’s value is \\\"**Default**\\\" and Monitoring.TSD is present in your service’s OpConfig. Changing this attribute’s value from \\\"**Default**\\\" will override your service’s DataSet with the custom value.\\n3426: \\n3427: For example, here **Monitoring.TSD : PerformanceStreamDataset’s** value is changed to “**Prod:eu-south-2**” and **PerformanceStreamDestination's** value is changed to \\\"zaz\\\":\\n3428: \\n3429: ![Monitor TSD](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/multi_region_metric_monitoring/monitoring_tsd_v2.png)\\n3430: \\n3431: After an active deployment, these changes are reflected on MWS:\\n3432: \\n3433: ![Example Metrics](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/multi_region_metric_monitoring/example_metrics.png)\\n3434: \\n3435: ##### How Do I Use Monitoring.TSD?\\n3436: \\n3437: 1. Navigate to your service’s Apollo environment.\\n3438: 1. On the right hand side under “*Environment Actions”*, click “*Edit environment operational configuration*.”\\n3439: 1. Search for \\\"[*Monitoring.TSD*](https://apollo.amazon.com/operational_configuration.html?setId=371)*\\\"* under \\\"*Sets Available*.\\\" Ensure you select \\\"*Monitoring.TSD*\\\" and not the other available monitoring sets.\\n3440: 1. Add the “*Monitoring.TSD*” Apollo operational configuration set to your environment.\\n3441: 1. Make “Monitoring.TSD : PerformanceStreamDataset” equal to your required “<Domain>:<AWS_Region>”, where *<Domain>* is your current Apollo environment’s Domain and *<AWS_Region>* is the AWS-region of where your stack is currently running. For example: “prod:eu-south-2”.\\n3442: 1. Change “Monitoring.TSD : PerformanceStreamDestination” to the new region where your service is operating from, \\\"zaz\\\" in this example. \\n3443: 1. Commit these changes.\\n3444: 1. Return to your service’s Apollo environment. On the right hand side under “*Edit Stage Properties”* , click “*Preview operational configuration*”*.*\\n3445: 1. Validate that your changes are committed in your operational configuration file (Highlighted yellow).\\n3446: 1. Once a deployment is executed, these changes will be applied. This can be done through a minimal deployment as well.\\n3447: \\n3448: This configuration changes the Dataset for all metrics in your environment to <Domain>:<AWS_Region> before sending them to Monitoring Web Services.  You can also differentiate your Beta, Alpha, and Gamma metrics by following the steps above but configuring each stage’s operational configuration instead of the *environment operation configuration*.\\n3449: \\n3450: \\n3451: ##### What If I Use MetricAgent Stream Configurations?\\n3452: \\n3453: You can check if your service utilizes MetricAgent stream configurations by checking its `$APOLLO_ENVIRONMENT_ROOT_DIRECTORY/monitoring/metricagent/` directory for any `.json` files.\\n3454: \\n3455: If your service is already using MetricAgent’s stream configurations to modify your Dataset, your stream configuration will be overridden by **Monitoring.TSD : PerformanceStreamDataset** if it is present and different from 'Default'.\\n3456: \\n3457: For example, say you have a stream configuration that is already modifying your metrics' Dataset and/or other fields:\\n3458: \\n3459: ```\\n3460:  {\\n3461:   \\\"Streams\\\" : [\\n3462:      {\\n3463:         \\\"monitorFileName\\\" : \\\"service_log\\\",\\n3464:         \\\"rotateMinutes\\\" : \\\"1440\\\",\\n3465:         \\\"seperator\\\" : \\\"EOE\\\",\\n3466:         \\\"schema\\\" : \\\"Service\\\"\\n3467:         \\\"dataset\\\" : \\\"Test:Prod\\\"\\n3468:      }\\n3469:   ]\\n3470:  }\\n3471: ```\\n3472: \\n3473: “**Test:Prod**” will be overridden with **Monitoring.TSD : PerformanceStreamDataset’s** custom value when your service’s metrics are pushed to MWS.\\n3474: \\n3475: \\n3476: #### FAQ\\n3477: \\n3478: ##### What Is Clashing Data?\\n3479: \\n3480: Monitoring Web Service does not support publishing the same metric from multiple regions. If your service publishes metrics to the same resource from two regions, the values you see on iGraph could be inaccurate and misleading. You may see values from either of the two regions; the same applies to your services’ alarms. When a particular metric is actively receiving data in multiple regions concurrently, it becomes [clashing data](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/ClashingData#What_is_.27Clashing_Data.27_.3F)— iGraph containing an incorrect view of the service’s metric data as it's unclear which region has the true metric:\\n3481: \\n3482: ![iGraph Example](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/multi_region_metric_monitoring/igraph_example.png)\\n3483: \\n3484: If your service has clashing data, please follow the recommended approach at the top. \\n3485: \\n3486: ## Module 10: Validate your service stack\\n3487: \\n3488: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this module, you will have conducted validations on your service in the target region.\\n3489: \\n3490: \\n3491: \\n3492: ### Lesson 10.1: Basic sanity testing\\n3493: \\n3494: You don't know if it works if you aren't trying it! This may require some test data set up. Make sure to validate the current production region as well as the new region.\\n3495: \\n3496: This part may be difficult depending on when you're doing it. Today, you cannot start your service up until all of your dependencies have updated their client config files, and you cannot trivially make cross-region calls ([BubbleBridge](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BubbleBridge/) requires per-service-pair onboarding), which causes a series of parallelization problems. And even once you call cross-region, your timeouts need to be updated as well. To help with all that, [Almanac](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Almanac/), [BigMesh Global Endpoints](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BigMesh_Global_Endpoints/), and a few others are working together to reduce this need for serialization to keep your work unblocked. But again, all of this is forward-looking and not ready yet.\\n3497: \\n3498: **Summary:** Test yourself! Make sure the service starts up, can be called by tests, and can call its dependencies.\\n3499: \\n3500: \\n3501: # Migration Milestone 2: Make your data accessible\\n3502: \\n3503: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this milestone, your service's data will be accessible in the target region.\\n3504: \\n3505: Assuming Migration Milestone 1: Set up your infrastructure has been performed successfully, by the end of Migration Milestone 2: Make your data accessible, your service will be able to handle traffic, although it may be slow.\\n3506: \\n3507: ## Module 11: Data accessibility\\n3508: \\n3509: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this module, your service's data will be accessible in the target region.\\n3510: \\n3511: Now that we set up our compute stacks, it's time for Data Migrations! **RFE** worked with **Engineering Excellence** to create this super cool course for you to walk you through the steps and information for Data Migration and Management. Please check it out [here](https://learn.a2z.com/app/course/amzn1.c3.v2.7b94f67d-fd8d-46e9-aa87-d83c8ad87ade/).\\n3512: \\n3513: The Transactional Data Movement org has also prepared several recipes presenting a set of migration strategies that can be followed for different datastore types.  For now they cover DynamoDB, S3, Sable, and RDS.\\n3514: \\n3515: | Datastore Technology     | Guidance                                                                                                  |\\n3516: |--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n3517: | DynamoDB                 | [DynamoDB Data Migration Recipes](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/DynamoDBMigrationStrategies/)             |\\n3518: | Elasticsearch/OpenSearch | [Elasticsearch/OpenSearch Data Migration Recipes](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/ESOSMigrationStrategies/) |\\n3519: | RDS                      | [RDS Migration Recipes](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/RDSMigrationStrategies/)                            |\\n3520: | S3                       | [S3 Migration Recipes](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/S3MigrationStrategies/)                              |\\n3521: | Sable                    | [Use M2X](https://console.m2x.amazon.dev/)                                                                |\\n3522: | SNS/SQS                  | [SNS/SQS Migration Recipes](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/SNSSQSDataMigrationstrategies)                  |\\n3523: \\n3524: \\n3525: An important point to consider as you look at your data migration strategy options, there has been a tendency within SDO to use transactional exactness in many cases where it's not actually necessary. Inertia from our old \\\"oracle days\\\", teams in SDO often expected values created transactionally exact with referential integrity and brought those expectations into their use of DDB, sometimes without careful consideration. So when you're considering your data migration strategy, looking at the transactional use of DDB or other products, it's important to re-frame the consideration around the customer use case and the API's user stories.\\n3526: \\n3527: Two examples, running in a single region today, and both using transactional exactness to make a data change.\\n3528: \\n3529: Changing the name of the customer - in this case, the CX implications of showing the wrong name for a few short seconds when data is replicated globally would be acceptable. Customers don't change their names often, and the impact to downstream systems is also likely acceptable. Therefore, using data systems like DDB global tables and accepting that values might be incorrect for a few seconds is a smart business trade-off to accelerate and _simplify_ the architecture. In this sort of use case, you can think of having caches and copies of the data replicated outward, and accepting the cache propagation delay in your user stories. Taking an example from a team who has already gotten into many new regions, Prime Video found that most of their systems could actually support the replication cost without customer impact.\\n3530: \\n3531: Debiting the balance of a gift-card balance on a customer account. - in this case, the business must have financial correctness so that customers cannot \\\"in-parallel\\\" debit the same balance multiple times. We all learned this use case (ATMs and banks) in our CS courses in college/high-school/textbooks/etc. So in this scenario the data must be modified from a single place, and replication cannot flow back and forth across the world, one single record must be correct and other systems must use that same record for their use cases. In this sort of use case, you must _move_ the record to the new location, and any copies or replicas must be kept in sync during the transactional modification or during any read of that record. One way or another (consistency-on-write or consistency-on-read) consistency is key to your use case.\\n3532: \\n3533: From the two examples above you can see two solutions for data access in new regions, namely eventual consistency of a replica, and transactional-exactness (again, either implemented as consistency on write, or consistency on read). In the first case, simply enabling Dynamo global tables creates a simple path for eventual consistency, but data movement, use of solutions like Hotwire (available today for Dynamo->Dynamo), and/or cross-region calls are _required_ for transactional exactness to be maintained as part of your use case.\\n3534: \\n3535: \\n3536: \\n3537: # Migration Milestone 3: Production readiness and incremental traffic shifting\\n3538: \\n3539: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this milestone, your service is taking traffic in target region.\\n3540: \\n3541: \\n3542: \\n3543: ## Module 12: Production readiness\\n3544: \\n3545: > **_GOAL:_** By end of this module, your service will be ready to get traffic in the destination region.\\n3546: \\n3547: \\n3548: \\n3549: ### Lesson 12.1: Define your alarms in your CDK pipeline and take a region parameter\\n3550: \\n3551: [Here](https://builderhub.corp.amazon.com/docs/native-aws/developer-guide/cdk-monitoring.html) is the Builderhub link to define your alarms. We copied over a couple common cases here.\\n3552: \\n3553: _Lambda_  \\n3554: When setting up monitoring for AWS Lambda function deployed with AWS CDK, you'll typically want to monitor metrics such as invocation count, errors, duration, and throttles. You can set up alarms to notify you if something goes wrong. As per BuilderHub recommendation, to monitor your service in Lambda today, you will likely want to use CloudWatch log scans.\\n3555: \\n3556: **Enable Logging for Lambda**  \\n3557: When you create a Lambda function, AWS automatically creates CloudWatch Logs log group for that function. By default, AWS Lambda writes logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs in the log group that corresponds to the Lambda function. Ensure that your Lambda function has the necessary IAM permissions to write logs. The AWS managed policy ‘AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole’ provides the permissions that the function needs to write logs to CloudWatch Logs.\\n3558: \\n3559: **Query Logs with CloudWatch logs insights**\\n3560: \\n3561: 1. Open the CloudWatch Console\\n3562: 1. In the navigation pane, choose **\\\"Logs\\\"** then choose **\\\"Log groups\\\"** \\n3563: 1. Select the log group for your Lambda function. By default, this is **\\\"/aws/lambda/<function-name>**\\\".\\n3564: 1. Choose **\\\"Log Insights\\\"** tab\\n3565: 1. In the query editor, write your own queries\\n3566: \\n3567: **Automating your queries**\\n3568: \\n3569: 1. To automate the monitoring and create alerts based on specific log patterns, you can\\n3570:     1. Write a scheduled Lambda function that runs CloudWatch Log Insights queries using **\\\"StartQuery\\\"** API.\\n3571:     1. Use the query results to determine if an alert should be sent.\\n3572: 1. If an alert condition is met, have the Lambda function send notifications (i.e. via SNS topic)\\n3573: \\n3574: **Create metric filters to alarm based on your automated queries**\\n3575: \\n3576: 1. In the CloudWatch console, go to **‘logs’**  and select the log group for your Lambda function.\\n3577: 1. Choose **‘Create metric filter’** \\n3578: 1. Define a pattern to match (timestamp = XX, request_id = “ERROR” etc)\\n3579: 1. Assign the metric a name and value\\n3580: 1. Set the filter to monitor the occurrence of the pattern and to increment the metric\\n3581: 1. Once the filter is created, you can create an alarm on the new custom metric.\\n3582: 1. Define the alarm threshold and action based on the metric. (i.e. Sev-2 range, Sev-1 range, Sev-3 range)\\n3583: \\n3584: Example:  \\n3585: ![1705364138382-368.png](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/define_your_alarms_in_your_cdk_pipeline_and_take_a_region_parameter/1705364138382-368.png)\\n3586: \\n3587: _EC2_  \\n3588: For instance monitoring, BuilderHub recommends using the CloudWatch Agent to push instance metrics to CloudWatch. The sample application wires the most basic metrics for you that you can customize later. \\n3589: \\n3590: 1. Follow the instructions to get the metrics agent up and running on ECE. This will allow EC2 to publish to both PMET and CloudWatch. \\n3591:    * If your ZAZ/FRA environment is in an AWS account created after July 29 2024, follow Monitor Webservice’s [onboarding guide](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/MonitoringWebService/Docs/MWSAuthorization/OnboardingGuide/#HIhaveanewaccountinNAWSandusingMetricAgenttopublishmetrics.WhatistheminimumchangeIneed3F) to provision compute-level fine grain permission for PMET metric publishing, otherwise your metrics will not be published.\\n3592: 1. Metrics that you want to use for EC2 autoscaling must go to CloudWatch Metrics.\\n3593: 1. After your CloudWatch Agent is configured and running on your EC2 instance, you can define CloudWatch alarms for specific metrics in your CDK stack. \\n3594: 1. Deploy the CDK Stack to AWS.\\n3595: 1. After your stack is deployed, your EC2 instance should be reporting metrics to CloudWatch, and your alarms will be active to notify. You if the specific thresholds are breached.  \\n3596: Note: Make sure the IAM Role associated with the EC2 instance has the necessary permissions to interact with CloudWatch (put metrics, logs, etc).\\n3597: \\n3598: ### Lesson 12.2: Regional Endpoint Configuration Readiness Checklist\\n3599: \\n3600: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this lesson, you should be able to attest that your pipeline is ready for production traffic.\\n3601: \\n3602: **Goal:** Check your service's is ready to receive traffic in the new region. Note that this checklist covers common cases and supplements your service's existing Operational Readiness Review (ORR) or similar processes, not replace them. The goal of this lesson is to confirm that your service is “Ready for Traffic Shifting”.\\n3603: \\n3604: > !NOTE:  Complete the **LRA Configuration** section **only if** you onboarded to LRA as part of **Lesson 1.1: Onboard your callee service to LRA**. \\n3605: \\n3606: ### **LRA Configuration:** Check your LRA endpoint is working<br>\\n3607: 1. **End-to-End Request (Recommended)**<br>\\n3608:     1. Validate your LRA endpoint configuration by performing an end-to-end request test across all configured regions. This can be done either manually or through integration testing. A successful response and confirmation that it has reached the expected regional endpoint validates that your LRA endpoint is properly configured.\\n3609:         * If you lack the necessary infrastructure for end-to-end testing, you can use the alternative verification methods described below. However, please note that end-to-end testing remains the most reliable method for ensuring your LRA endpoint is functioning as intended.\\n3610: 2. **LRA Target Region Request**<br>\\n3611:     1. Check your LRA is configured to send requests in the target region to your new endpoint in the target region (e.g. ZAZ → ZAZ). Follow these steps to perform the verification:\\n3612:         1. Execute: `mechanic ex lra tool describe-configuration --endpoint=<Your-Lra-Endpoint> --region pdx-prod`\\n3613:         2. Verify that that your `eu-south-2` (ZAZ) caller region is configured to your ZAZ regional endpoint.\\n3614:         3. Update your LRA endpoint to resolve to your new endpoint in the target region (e.g. foo.zaz.amazon) if your LRA endpoint is missing configurations for the target region (e.g `eu-south-2`) or is configured to resolve to your endpoint in the source region. You can perform this using [TSA](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/TSA/Guide-to-update-LRA-endpoint-resolution-on-TSA). If you are certain your service does not have callers in the target region you can do this via LRA CLI `update-configuration`. More information [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/LRA/FAQs#HImadeamistakewhencreatingmyLRAendpoint2CbutI2019msurethatnobodyisusingityet.HowcanIfixit3F).\\n3615:   3. **Alternative Verification Methods**<br>\\n3616:         1. Certificate Verification: To verify your certificates, you'll need to perform a TLS handshake with your LRA Endpoint in each configured region. This verification must be conducted from a host that has connectivity to your services and is located in a region where your LRA endpoint is configured. Follow these steps to perform the verification:<br>\\n3617:             1. If your LRA endpoint is `prod.foo.lra.amazon` and it's configured to direct `eu-south-2` clients to `foo.dub.amazon.com`, you would need to execute the verification command from a host in `eu-south-2`. This verification can be performed using a CURL command with your LRA endpoint:\\n3618:                 1. Execute: `curl https://<LRA Endpoint>:<HTTPS Port>/sping`\\n3619:             2. After running this command, confirm that it returns Healthy from hosts in **ALL** regions where your LRA endpoint is configured. This confirmation ensures that your certificate verification is successful and your endpoints are properly configured in each region.\\n3620:         2. DNS check: To perform a health check on the LRA endpoint for all configured regions, follow these steps:<br>\\n3621:             * The following health check command performs a DNS check to confirm the LRA endpoint resolves to the regional endpoint configured for the caller region; verifying that all the regions are `Healthy`. For more details on health check refer to this [FAQ](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/LRA/FAQs#HVerificationMethods).<br>\\n3622:             * Execute: `mechanic ex lra health check --region pdx-prod --endpoint <Your LRA endpoint>` <br>\\n3623:             * ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/regional_endpoint_readiness_checklist/DNS_Check-LRA-Resolve.png)\\n3624: \\n3625:         3. AAA Configuration: Check your LRA endpoint is added to your AAA application. Follow these steps to perform the verification:<br>\\n3626:             1. Visit the [ServiceLens](https://servicelens.jumpstart.amazon.dev/#/) website.<br>\\n3627:             2. Select \\\"My Applications\\\" (on the top right side) and select the application your service exists.<br>\\n3628:             3. Select the \\\"Services\\\" tab select your service.<br>\\n3629:             4. Select \\\"EndPoints\\\" tab.<br>\\n3630:             5. Verify that LRA endpoint is added in the correct format ending with `*.lra.amazon` **NOT** `*.lra.amazon.com` <br>\\n3631:                 * ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/regional_endpoint_readiness_checklist/AAA_Verify-LRA-Endpoint.png)\\n3632:             6. Skip the following steps if your LRA Endpoint is already listed in your Service Endpoint table. These instructions are only necessary if you need to add your LRA Endpoint to your Service Endpoint configuration.\\n3633:                 1. Click on add endpoint\\n3634:                 2. Select \\\"Manually Enter Endpoints\\\" from the pop-up window opened.\\n3635:                 3. Perform the following actions for each LRA endpoint determined in Step 1:\\n3636:                     1. Select \\\"Default - Any region except for China\\\" for the security region.\\n3637:                     2. Enter the LRA endpoint to add, prefixed with https:// and Click \\\"Add\\\" button\\n3638:                     3. Repeat this for your services other LRA endpoints.\\n3639:                     4. Complete the action after adding all the LRA endpoints by clicking \\\"Add Endpoints\\\".\\n3640:             \\n3641: ### **Verify your service has properly set up Connectivity Tools:** \\n3642: Verify you have set up connectivity for your service by ensuring you have your new region's regional endpoint (`foo.zaz.amazon.com`) have properly onboarded to connectivity tools like SuperStar. This step only verify your service has properly set up connectivity but to properly test connectivity would require an end-to-end request. **!Note:** LRA endpoint (foo.**lra.amazon**) must not be on SuperStar endpoints. Super-Star will add a safe-guard to prevent adding  *.lra.amazon endpoints; but until then you need to verify the LRA endpoint was not added to SuperStar.\\n3643: 1. Verify by revisiting the **Lesson 1.3: Setup Cross-Region Connectivity** to confirm all pipelines for your service have the Registered status. Since infrastructure changes may have occurred since your initial setup, this verification step ensures your pipelines in your service remain properly onboarded.<br>\\n3644: ![Registered](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/regional_endpoint_readiness_checklist/VerifyConnectivity_Lesson-1_3-Regisered.png)<br>\\n3645: 2. Action any pipelines from your service that are `Not Registered`, follow the `Suggested Action` to onboard to the suggested connectivity tool for the pipeline. This process may take **up to 24 hours** to reflect as `Registered` once you have perform the suggested actions properly.<br>\\n3646: ![Not Registered](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/regional_endpoint_readiness_checklist/VerifyConnectivity_Lesson-1_3-NotRegisered.png)<br>\\n3647: 3. For cases of `No Data` follow the same procedure to perform the `Suggested Action` however since the connectivity tool may not have enough data on the pipeline it may not appear in the `Registered` tabs even after properly performing the suggested actions.<br>\\n3648: ![No Data](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/regional_endpoint_readiness_checklist/VerifyConnectivity_Lesson-1_3-NoData.png)<br>\\n3649: \\n3650: ### **Check that alarms has been configured for the New Region**\\n3651: 1. Please review **Lesson 12.1: Define your alarms in your CDK pipeline and take a region parameter** to verify that you have properly set up alarms in the new region. This setup should include setting up appropriate CloudWatch alarms and comprehensive monitoring dashboards tailored to your service needs. This ensures comprehensive visibility into your service's performance and health in the new region. \\n3652: \\n3653: \\n3654: \\n3655: ### Lesson 12.3: Readying your pipeline for production\\n3656: \\n3657: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this lesson your service should be ready for production deployment.\\n3658: \\n3659: Once your service is ready for production traffic, you’ll want to make sure associated pipeline stages are labeled as production in your pipeline. This will 1) remove the short-circuiting in place with [Accelerated Releases](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CraneCD/AcceleratedReleases/StoresRegional/) to deploy to your production stages “as usual”, and 2) will ensure appropriate Dogma rules are applied to your new region stage. This can be done by hand (In Pipelines, Edit then “make this stage prod”), via LPT ([example](https://code.amazon.com/packages/AIDICEPredictorBaseLpt/blobs/0edb638c4d39d90e43e4b1544ed854750875d59e/--/lib/amazon/lpt/templates/aidicepredictor_lpt_base.rb#L177-L179)), or via CDK ([example](https://code.amazon.com/packages/PipelineBestPracticeEnforcementCDK/blobs/a6770f880386b21afe94411b5860ffde6c5cf4ca/--/lib/appFactory.ts#L60)). This needs to be done BEFORE you receive production traffic to your new stage(s).\\n3660: \\n3661: | If my current pipeline... | Then my new stages for ZAZ nd FRA should... |\\n3662: |:----- | :----- |\\n3663: | Is using Accelerated Releases.<br /><br />This can be verified by following Edit -> Manage Accelerated Releases and checking if any boxes are checked. | Be ready to go! |\\n3664: | Has the new region at the start of the piepline, or in a place other than where I want it in my production flow. | Be moved to match the pipeline's standard deployment practices. E.g. they should be in new pipeline stages next to DUB if your pipeline currently deploys to one region at a time.|\\n3665: \\n3666: ## Module 13: Traffic Shifting\\n3667: \\n3668: > **_GOAL:_** By end of this module, you will learn about the traffic shifting process and the related terms, and if your service is not part of a sub-experience, you will have shifted your endpoint traffic from DUB to ZAZ.\\n3669: \\n3670: Traffic shifting is the step in which you move customer traffic from one endpoint to another. This is a high judgment and critical task, and like any other production change, it must be completed with safe-guards such as MCM, and 2P reviews. This guidance provides you with different options, safe-guards and known risks; however, review your actual traffic shifting steps with your tech lead and manager.\\n3671: \\n3672: Traffic shifting is performed by the builder of a *callee* service's to shift requests from its *caller service(s)* between the callee service's different regional endpoints. In this guide we call the endpoint the requests are shifted from, the *source endpoint*, and the endpoint requests are shifted to, the *destination endpoint*.\\n3673: \\n3674: ![Traffic Shifting](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/traffic_switching/CnP_26112024_135646.png)\\n3675: \\n3676: {{error}}\\n3677:  Before migrating traffic or experimenting in the target region, estimate your cross-region network bandwidth usage from source to target region route and vice versa. If the max utilization during peak days is greater than 1Gbps for either route you must follow the [approval process](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Migration_Issues_Tracker/DUB-ZAZ_NetworkUsageApprovalProcess/) for bandwidth allocation.\\n3678: {{/error}}\\n3679: \\n3680: ### Lesson 13.1: Should you shift your traffic?\\n3681: \\n3682: > **_GOAL:_** By end of this lesson, you will decide if you should proceed with the Traffic Shifting module.\\n3683: \\n3684: For reasons such as latency, some services must exit DUB together in group migrations where multiple services migrate with each other. The group is called a sub-experience in RFE's [strategy](https://wiki.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Deep_Dives_and_Announcements/Announcements/Exit_DUB_Strategy/). If your service is part of a sub-experience you must not shift your service's traffic unless it is instructed by the [sub-experience](https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/subExperiences)'s Migration Coordinator, MC. For most sub-experiences the traffic shifting happens where customer requests enter Amazon's network (Network Edge). The red arrows in the diagram below show where the traffic shifting happens for individual services and sub-experiences.\\n3685: \\n3686: ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/should_you_shift_your_traffic/CnP_26112024_141220._CB540346123_.png)\\n3687: \\n3688: You can find the sub-experiences your service is part of on the Migration Plan Overview page of the current migration plan per screenshot below.\\n3689: \\n3690: ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/should_you_shift_your_traffic/CnP_26112024_142647.png)\\n3691: \\n3692: If your service is included in a sub-experience that it is not part of, contact the sub-experience's Migration Coordinator to remove your service. The sub-experience Migration Coordinator can be found on the [Sub-experience Migration Plans](https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/subExperiences).\\n3693: \\n3694: ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/should_you_shift_your_traffic/CnP_26112024_142737.png)\\n3695: \\n3696: {{info}}\\n3697:  If you don’t have to shift the traffic of your service because your service is part of a sub-experience, please mark this lesson and the other lessons under the Traffic Shifting Module as completed with no further actions. \\n3698: {{/info}}\\n3699: \\n3700: ### Lesson 13.2: Traffic Shifting Strategy\\n3701: \\n3702: > **_GOAL:_** By end of this lesson, you will understand the distinct traffic sources along with traffic shifting tools that are best suited for your service and create a traffic shifting strategy.\\n3703: \\n3704: ## Overview\\n3705: \\n3706: The final step of this migration process involves gradually shifting the live user traffic from the source region to the newly deployed infrastructure in the target region. This needs to be done in a controlled manner to ensure a seamless transition without disrupting the application's availability or introducing any connectivity or latency issues for the end-users.\\n3707: \\n3708: 1.  Implement a mechanism to gradually redirect a specified percentage of the live traffic from the source region to the target region, while monitoring the application's performance and user experience.\\n3709: 2.  Ensure that the redirected traffic is not impacting any service performance and availability metrics, specially the latency experienced by the users is within acceptable limits.\\n3710: 3.  Provide a rollback plan in case any issues are encountered during the traffic redirection process, to quickly revert the traffic back to the source region.\\n3711: 4.  Ensure a seamless transition for the end-users, with minimal to no disruption in the application's availability and user experience.\\n3712: \\n3713: ## Identifying traffic Sources\\n3714: \\n3715: Before implementing a traffic shift between regions, it's crucial to identify all distinct traffic sources to your service. Various clients may be accessing your service through different paths, making comprehensive source discovery essential for a successful migration. To assist in this process, we'll outline key methods and tools for discovering traffic sources. Once you've mapped all incoming traffic patterns, you can effectively utilize the appropriate shifting tools (detailed in subsequent sections) to execute the migration. This systematic approach ensures no traffic sources are overlooked during the transition process.\\n3716: \\n3717: ### AXON\\n3718: \\n3719: **Link**: <https://axon.ops.amazon.dev/service-graph/>\\n3720: The Axon tool provides a primary method for discovering traffic sources by analyzing callee and caller services when given an environment name. This tool specifically helps identify clients sending traffic to your service. However, it's important to note that some endpoints may not be scanned by AXON. To leverage AXON , verify that your service has successfully completed Convoy onboarding, as AXON is bundled with Convoy.\\n3721: \\n3722: ### Code repository\\n3723: \\n3724: **Link:** [code.amazon.com](http://code.amazon.com)\\n3725: Code repository analysis serves as another method for traffic source discovery. By traversing the Amazon code repository for specific endpoints, you can identify services that are sending traffic to your application. This approach is particularly useful for finding client instances defined within service packages that might not be immediately visible through other tools.\\n3726: \\n3727: ### M2X\\n3728: \\n3729: **Link:** <https://console.m2x.amazon.dev/pipeline-details/61405>\\n3730: \\n3731: M2X, typically used for data migration, offers another avenue for traffic source identification. When provided with a pipeline, it can map upstream and downstream pipeline connections, revealing client traffic patterns. However, be aware that clients sending traffic without an established pipeline may not appear in M2X analysis results.\\n3732: \\n3733: ### I-Graph metrics via Monitor Portal\\n3734: \\n3735: **Link**: <https://monitorportal.amazon.com/igraph>\\n3736: IGraph metrics provide a comprehensive view of traffic patterns. Since each client interaction generates metrics, analyzing IGraph data allows you to identify distinct clients and their corresponding traffic methods. This approach offers a data-driven perspective on traffic patterns and helps validate findings from other discovery methods.\\n3737: \\n3738: **Recommendation:**\\n3739: Given that each service architecture is unique, it's crucial to utilize multiple discovery methods rather than relying on a single approach. This comprehensive strategy ensures complete coverage of all traffic sources, as missing even a single client could result in residual traffic in the source region after migration. We recommend implementing a combination of these tools based on your service's specific requirements to achieve complete traffic source discovery.\\n3740: \\n3741: ## Traffic Shifting Tools\\n3742: Depending on your service's availability SLAs and the type of services that call your service, you can choose from different traffic shifting tools:\\n3743: \\n3744: 1.  **DNS:** You can configure the DNS for your existing endpoint (e.g. DUB endpoint) to resolve to your new endpoint (e.g. ZAZ endpoint). For example you can update the A records for your service endpoint in DUB, `foo.dub.amazon.com`, to return the IP address of your service endpoint in ZAZ, `foo.zaz.amazon.com`. This is called a *DNS flip* and will eventually take effect depending on the Time To Live (TTL) of your DNS record. You can also use Route 53 to gradually change the DNS resolutions for your endpoint. This is called *Weighted DNS Traffic Shifting.* To learn more, *s*ee [Prime Video's DNS traffic shifting guidance](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AV_Operational_Excellence/NativeAWS/Guidance/DNSTrafficMigration/).\\n3745: 2.  **Weblab:** [Weblab](https://weblab.amazon.com/) is SDO's tool for running experiments. With Weblab, you create an experiment on Weblab's UI. Your service's callers need to be configured to send the request to your different endpoints based on their Weblab treatment. When using Weblab you send the control (C) to the source endpoint and the treatments (T1, T2, etc) to the destination endpoint. Traffic shifting with Weblab requires you to coordinate code changes on your callers. However, some callers such as Shopping Portal and Online Proxy Fleet (OPF) have integrated with Weblab and you can shift incoming requests from them without code changes. We will look into identifying your service's callers in the next section. Additional Shopping Portal and OPF resources:\\n3746: \\n3747:     1.  Shopping Portal: <https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/ShoppingPortal/AwayTeamModel/CEWeblabguidelines/>\\n3748:     2.  Shopping Portal example: [Weblab and JumpStart Guidance for Traffic Shifting to New Region](https://quip-amazon.com/FFEMA5k57Vzz)\\n3749:     3.  OPF non-retail: <https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/OPF/Operations/SelfService/OPFWeblab/>\\n3750:     4.  OPF retail: Most retail services behind OPF are fronted by Shopping Portal and can utilize Shopping Portal's Weblab.(OPF→Shopping Portal → Service). If your service is one of the rare retail services that is called directly by OPF consider this option: <https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/SwitchNextGen/ServiceMigration>\\n3751: \\n3752: 4.  **Traffic Shifting Accelerator, TSA:** Sits between DNS and Weblab in terms of builder effort, gradual shifting and monitoring. TSA is integrated with RFP and you can perform TSA traffic shifts as part of your RFP Service Migration Plan - please find the **Traffic Shifting Accelerator** under the current migration module. TSA shifts requests on caller services by intercepting and overriding the endpoint for the requests before they are sent to your service endpoint. To do this, the caller service needs to be integrated with TSA. The requests from integrated callers are called *TSA shiftable traffic*. You can see how many of your service's incoming requests are shiftable [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/TSA/ShiftableTraffic/). You can overlay the shiftable metric with your service metric to see what portion of your requests are TSA shiftable. Learn more about shifting traffic with TSA [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/TSA).\\n3753: \\n3754: You can see how these tools compare in [this wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/TSA/ToolsComparison/). In summary TSA fills the gap between DNS's lower builder effort and Weblab's monitoring, impact detection and rollback.\\n3755: \\n3756: **Builder effort (Best → Better)**\\n3757: \\n3758: DNS → TSA → Weblab\\n3759: \\n3760: \\n3761: **Monitoring, impact detection and rollback (Best → Better)**\\n3762: \\n3763: Weblab → TSA → DNS\\n3764: \\n3765: \\n3766: **Preventing failures when the caller cannot connect to the callee (Best → Better)**\\n3767: \\n3768: TSA → Weblab → DNS\\n3769: \\n3770: \\n3771: **Traffic Shifting Strategy:** We create a traffic shifting strategy based on your service and services that call it. The strategy generally uses one or more of the traffic shifting tools following these guidelines:\\n3772: \\n3773: -   **The perfect tool does not exist:** Amazon has broad and rich variation across services and hence it is unlikely that a tool works for all use-cases and variations. We will not let this block us; this means we may choose a tool that covers a portion of the traffic or use multiple tools for a single endpoint.\\n3774: -   **The initial portion of the shift is the riskiest:** Usually the first few percentage of the traffic shift is the most risky, because the new endpoint will start to receive production traffic. Start with tools that have better control over request selection and select smaller initial steps e.g. 0.1% → 1% → 2% → 5% → 10% → 20% → 40% → 60% → 80% → 100%.\\n3775: -   **Move fast when it is safe:** Traffic shifting is a high judgement process and the service owners need to find the right balance between bias for action and insist on highest standards. For example, you can move faster for a service that can sustain 1-2 hours of outage without impacting customers, compared to a service that will immediately impact customers during an outage.\\n3776: -   **You are not alone:** Many teams across SDO are going through this process, so you can learn from their learnings or share yours. If you have not already done so, please join the #region-flex-2024 slack channel and seach for Traffic Shifting in the channel.\\n3777: -   **Careful with DNS flips:** Do not use DNS flip unless your service can sustain a 1-2 hour outage. If none of the other tools work for your service, use weighted DNS shifts.\\n3778: \\n3779: For the strategy we follow the following decision tree, our goal is to shift as much as the traffic as possible, as safely, and as fast as possible.\\n3780: \\n3781: ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/choose_a_traffic_shifting_mechanism/CnP_26112024_144550.png)\\n3782: \\n3783: As shown in the diagram, depending on which services call your service, you may have to use multiple tools for a single endpoint. Having an exact list of callers is not a pre-requisite for traffic shifting unless you exclusively want to use Weblab for your traffic shifting. If you are not sure who the callers of your service are, you can try the following:\\n3784: \\n3785: * Use [Axon](https://axon.ops.amazon.dev/service-graph) by selecting your service's Apollo or SuperStar Environment to see your callers (on the left). Please note that some of your callers may not be shown on Axon, however, Axon is integrated with OPF and Shopping Portal and if your service is onboarded to Axon you can tell if either of those services call you. If you cannot find your service on Axon, onboard to Axon [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Axon/Development/Onboarding/Agent).\\n3786: \\n3787: ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/choose_a_traffic_shifting_mechanism/CnP_26112024_144653.png)\\n3788: \\n3789: -   If your service is using [AAA](https://aaa.amazon.com/dashboard), you can use AAA relationships to find your service's callers.\\n3790: -   Search your endpoint FQDN or client-configuration package on [code.amazon.com](https://code.amazon.com) to find the callers that depend on your service. Once you find the packages you can find the version-sets that consume the package and their respective pipelines.\\n3791: -   Ask your team lead or engineers that have a longer tenure on the team.\\n3792: \\n3793: Aside from the tools you use for shifting traffic, you need to verify when the traffic shifting is complete. A traffic shift is only complete when the source endpoint no longer receive requests. Note that some requests such as [load-balancer health checks](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Load_Balancers/Health_Checks/) may continue to persist after all customer traffic is shifted. Health-checks are usually a constant trend and do not follow the around clock cycle. The best way to verify all customer requests are shifted is by looking at your per-API metrics and service logs. Depending on your service's traffic patterns you may have to look back a few weeks or months on the metrics. For example if your service only receives requests over the weekends you need to verify the service has not received any requests for at least one weekend since the traffic shift was executed.\\n3794: \\n3795: Below is an example a traffic shifting strategy. \\n3796: \\n3797: | Order | Step | Coverage | Steps | Rollback |\\n3798: | --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |\\n3799: | 1 | Shift TSA shiftable traffic | ~30% of total traffic | 0.1% → 1% → 2% → 5% → 10% → 20% → 50% → 100% | set TSA dialup to the previous percentage. |\\n3800: | 2 | Shift traffic from Shopping Portal | ~20% of total traffic | 1% → 5% → 10% → 20% → 50% → 100% | set Weblab treatment to the previous percentage. |\\n3801: | 3 | Shift traffic from top-talker service Foo by adding Weblab to Foo | ~15% of total traffic | 1% → 5% → 10% → 20% → 50% → 100% | set Weblab treatment to the previous percentage. |\\n3802: | 4 | Shift the rest of the traffic using weighted DNS | ~35% of total traffic | 1% → 5% → 10% → 20% → 50% → 100% | set Route53 weight to the previous percentage. |\\n3803: | 5 | Verify traffic shift is complete | N/A | check source endpoint metrics and service logs | N/A |\\n3804: \\n3805: ### Lesson 13.3: Prepare for the Traffic Shift\\n3806: \\n3807: > **_GOAL:_** By end of this lesson, you will have created the MCM(s) that will be used to perform the traffic shifting, have updated your dashboards and alarms to be ready for the traffic shifting and have tested the traffic shifting tool you are using against your pre-prod endpoints.\\n3808: \\n3809: **MCM:** Like any other manual production change, production traffic shifts must be conducted under an [MCM](https://mcm.amazon.com/). MCMs are a mechanism to lay out the steps of the traffic shifting strategy, monitoring, rollback steps, and performing reviews with and receiving approvals from your team lead and manager. Furthermore, MCM provides visibility to [CTOS](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CTOS/), allows you to handover the execution to another person if needed, and preserves the history for [COEs](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/COE) if something goes wrong. You can find Shopping Portal's Weblab dial up [template](https://mcm.amazon.com/templates/TM-107650) here and ReBalance program's example MCMs for DNS traffic shifting [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/ReBalance/Runbooks/Dashboards/Index). When creating the MCM you must include your team's on-call, manager and tech-lead as a reviewer.\\n3810: \\n3811: If your service is part of a sub-experience and the Migration Coordinator (MC) has asked you to shifting the traffic you must also add the MC as a reviewer. If your service has a few (5 or less) major callers, it's best practice to include them on the MCM.\\n3812: \\n3813: You should inform your callers when executing a traffic shift because some errors may be visible on their dashboards but not yours. If you have 100s of callers and do not have a mechanism(e.g email list) to inform them, you should inform your top-5-talker callers by adding them to the MCM as reviewers.\\n3814: \\n3815: **Dashboards and Alarms:** You may have to update your service alarms and dashboards for migrations. This is especially important if your service publishes metrics to [PMET](https://monitorportal.amazon.com/) using [MetricAgent](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/MonitoringTeam/MetricAgent/). PMET metrics are regional, i.e. if metrics with the same attributes are sent to multiple PMET regional endpoints, the metrics are not aggregated on PMET and your dashboard or alarms may not work as expected. If this happens, PMET adds a \\\"Clashing data detected\\\" warning. You need to fix this by following the Lesson 9.5: Multi-Region Metric Monitoring in MAWS and NAWS Services.\\n3816:   * If your ZAZ/FRA environment is in an AWS account created after July 29 2024, follow Monitor Webservice’s [onboarding guide](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/MonitoringWebService/Docs/MWSAuthorization/OnboardingGuide/#HIhaveanewaccountinNAWSandusingMetricAgenttopublishmetrics.WhatistheminimumchangeIneed3F) to provision compute-level fine grain permission for PMET metric publishing, otherwise your metrics will not be published.\\n3817: \\n3818: \\n3819: ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/create_an_mcm_for_your_traffic_shifting_plan/CnP_26112024_152653.png)\\n3820: \\n3821: As a temporary workaround and to see which region the clashing data is coming from, you can add the **ShowLocations=true** attribute to the metric on [iGraph](https://monitorportal.amazon.com/igraph). The clashing data warning disappears automatically after some time when there are no clashing data (the exact time depends on the period of the graph). Note that the ShowLocations=true attribute is not saved on iGraph urls and if you share the iGraph url with someone they need to add it too. See this [wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/ClashingData/) for more information.\\n3822: \\n3823: ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/create_an_mcm_for_your_traffic_shifting_plan/CnP_26112024_152931.png)\\n3824: \\n3825: **Pre-production testing:** If you are using a tool for the first time for the traffic shift, for example if this is the first time you are using Weblab or TSA, you should first use the tool on your pre-production endpoints.\\n3826: \\n3827: ### Lesson 13.4: Execute the Traffic Shifting Strategy\\n3828: \\n3829: > **_GOAL:_** By end of this lesson, you will have completed the traffic shifting of your service by executing the MCM(s).\\n3830: \\n3831: This is the most impactful step of the traffic shifting process. During this lesson you execute the MCM from the previous lesson. At this point, we assume your destination endpoint is ready to receive customer traffic and is scaled to handle requests. If your service is not ready or not scaled to receive traffic go back to the Production Readiness module.\\n3832: During your service's traffic shift the most important thing is to detect potential issues as soon as possible and use judgement to decide whether you should rollback, pause, or continue. Your traffic shifting may impact your callers or the services your service calls in a way that is not visible on your dashboard. For example, your service's latency may be higher in the destination region, which could result in timeouts on your service's callers. Before you begin executing the traffic shift make sure:\\n3833: \\n3834: 1.  All the MCM activities have rollback steps that you are comfortable executing. If not, add rollback steps or ask for help from your manager.\\n3835: 2.  You know how to ask for help if something goes wrong. If you don't, talk to your manager and team lead before starting.\\n3836: 3.  If your service is tier-1 or can have customer impact during outages you can register your traffic shift as a large scale event on <https://lse.amazon.com/>. It is a good practice to include adding the LSE as a step in your MCM and removing it at the end.\\n3837: 4.  If something goes wrong:\\n3838: \\n3839:     1.  Stay calm, and make decisions based on your knowledge of your service and the monitoring data. During traffic shifts rolling back may not always be the best option. If you decide to rollback it is important to decide how far you want to rollback to and that the source endpoint has capacity to serve the requests that will be rolled back. This should already be included in the MCM rollback steps. But keep this in mind especially during the final stages of the dial up where most of the traffic is moved to the destination endpoint. If you need help making decisions engage your manager. Engage [CTOS](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CTOS/) if there is widespread customer impact beyond your service and you need help making decisions.\\n3840:     2.  Make sure the impact is reported on the MCM or ongoing tickets. It is important to capture metrics and logs for root-causing the issues for the next iteration.\\n3841: \\n3842: 5.  During traffic shifts, at the minimum you should monitor the following:\\n3843: \\n3844:     1.  **Total request count:** the total number of requests, i.e. the sum of requests across the sources and destination endpoints, should follow your service's normal request count trend during the traffic shift. If your metric is on PMET you can use day over day or week over week overlays to check this. If you see a change in the number of requests then you need to investigate. Sometimes special events such as sport events or natural disasters result in divergence from the normal trend.\\n3845: \\n3846:     ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/dialing_up_traffic_to_your_new_regional_service_stack/CnP_26112024_160407.png)\\n3847:     \\n3848:     2.  **Error/Failures:** The percentage of errors or failures, that is the number of errors or failures divided by the total request count, should remain the same during the migration across the source and destination endpoint. If you see a change you need to investigate. For example, 5% errors on your source endpoint and 20% errors on the destination needs to be investigated. If you see errors that are out of normal bounds for your service, it needs to be investigated. \\n3849:     3.  **Latency:** If your service depends on other services, latency may be different before and after the traffic shift depending on where your dependencies are. As a rule of thumb, a return cross region call in EU region costs 60-70ms on average. When looking at latency it is important to look at the correct histogram distribution; most teams at Amazon look at P50, P90, and P99. Higher latency on your service in the destination endpoint can result in timeouts on services that call your service. For more information on timeouts refer to Module 8: Prepare for your service for cross-region latency.\\n3850: \\n3851: You are now ready to execute the traffic shifting strategy via MCM. [Reference MCM template](https://mcm.amazon.com/templates/TM-137516) Proceed to the next lesson once the MCM execution is complete.\\n3852: \\n3853: ### Lesson 13.5: Make the Traffic Shift Permanent\\n3854: \\n3855: > **_GOAL:_** By end of this lesson, you will make the traffic shift permanent for your service and cleanup the temporary resources.\\n3856: \\n3857: As mentioned in the previous lesson, you must only proceed with this step if all of your customer traffic is shifted from your source endpoint to your destination endpoint.\\n3858: \\n3859: Once the execution is complete you need to make the traffic shift permanent. Depending on your service, this step may include code or configuration changes. For example if your service is a Coral service, the endpoints in the Coral client config package need to be updated. Your team lead can help you with how to make the changes permanent; in most cases this includes updating code or configurations and replacing your source endpoint with the destination endpoint.\\n3860: \\n3861: A good starting point is searching for your source endpoint on [code.amazon.com](https://code.amazon.com). Code and configuration changes are generally slow to propagate. In most cases you need to [build your changes to live](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/GettingStartedGuideBuilderTools/BuildingPackageLive), and your callers need to merge the changes from live, which could take a few weeks or months depending how many callers your service has.\\n3862: \\n3863: Once the traffic shift is made permanent, you need to cleanup the resources you used for traffic shifting. The cleanup must not impact the shifted traffic because it was made permanent. \\n3864: \\n3865: For example, if you used Weblab, you need to dial down the Weblab from (C: 0% , T1: 100%) to (C: 100%, T1: 0%). When you make this Weblab change, you must not see any shift in traffic because you have already made the change permanent. Once the Weblab is dialed down, remove the references from the callers code, and delete the Weblab. \\n3866: \\n3867: If you used TSA, you need to dial down your traffic shift, and delete the traffic shifting configuration. It is important to dial-down the traffic shifting tools under MCM before removing them. The MCM will be very similar to the traffic shifting MCM except you go in reverse and you should not see any changes on your dashboards. Again start with a smaller change and then increase. For example: 100% → 99.9% → 99% → 95% → 90% → 80% → 60% → 40% → 20% → 0%. \\n3868: \\n3869: In summary:\\n3870: \\n3871: 1.  Verify the source endpoint is not receiving any traffic anymore\\n3872: 2.  Make the code or configuration changes to make the traffic change permanent.\\n3873: 3.  [Track the changes](https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/pipelines/user-guide/reference-track-changes/) to make sure it is consumed by all tracking pipelines.\\n3874: 4.  Search your source endpoint on [code.amazon.com](http://code.amazon.com) and verify it is not referenced. This step does not apply if your source endpoint was a CNAME (e.g to your VIPs) and it was updated to resolve to the destination endpoint.\\n3875: 5.  Create an MCM to dial down your traffic shift. This MCM will be very similar to your traffic shifting MCM with the following changes:\\n3876: \\n3877:     1.  You are dialing down (from 100% to 0%) instead of dialing up. For example the Weblab goes from (C: 0% , T1: 100%) to (C: 100%, T1: 0%).\\n3878:     2.  In monitoring activities you should not see any changes on your dashboards because you have already made the traffic shift permanent.\\n3879: \\n3880: 7.  Clean up the resources you used for traffic shifting. For example, remove the Weblabs and TSA traffic shifting configurations that you created.\\n3881: 8.  If you modified your dashboards during the traffic shift, revert them to the normal state. For example, if you added the **ShowLocation=true** attribute or changed your service's alarm thresholds.\\n3882: \\n3883: ### Traffic Shifting Accelerator\\n3884: \\n3885: > **_GOAL:_** After completing this sub-module, you will have successfully shifted all TSA-compatible traffic for your service endpoints from DUB to ZAZ.\\n3886: \\n3887: \\n3888: {{info}}\\n3889:  If you determined not to use Traffic Shifting Accelerator (TSA) based on the previous lessons of the Traffic Shifting module, please mark the Create Traffic Shifting Configurations lesson as Not Applicable.\\n3890: {{/info}}\\n3891: \\n3892: The Traffic Shifting Accelerator is a tool that allows service owners to shift client traffic safely between different endpoints without needing to make changes to their client configuration packages during the shift. For more details on Traffic Shifting Accelerator please see [this wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/TSA/).\\n3893: \\n3894: ### User Guide for the Service Owners\\n3895: There are five major steps to conduct a traffic shift through the Traffic Shifting Accelerator:\\n3896: \\n3897: 1. **Complete the prerequisites:** Before using the Traffic Shifting Accelerator, service owners must enable CloudAuth on their service, onboard to Axon for metric visibility, ensure client connectivity to the destination endpoint, and verify that the destination service is scaled and ready to receive traffic.\\n3898: 1. **Create the traffic shift configuration:** Use the traffic shifting configuration wizard to create a new configuration.\\n3899: 1. **Get the configuration approved:** You need to seek approval from any upline manager (L6+) in order to start the traffic shifting. Once approved, you can create the configuration to dial up.\\n3900: 1. **Dialling up the traffic:** During the traffic shift, the service owner will gradually dialup the allocation so that the destination endpoint will receive traffic that was previously routed to the source endpoint. Some dashboards are also provided in the Traffic Shift Accelerator in order to be able to further monitor the traffic shift.\\n3901: 1. **Cleanup:** Finally, once the traffic shift has reached 90%, service owners will initiate a cleanup phase to ensure that traffic is not dependent on Traffic Shift Accelerator, and is reflected accurately in the client configuration.\\n3902: \\n3903: Please check out the [Traffic Shifting Accelerator User Guide for Service Owners](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Almanac/TrafficShiftingAcceleratorUsageGuideforServiceOwners) for the details and learn how to use this accelerator.\\n3904: \\n3905: The guide covers:\\n3906: \\n3907: * The detailed prerequisites of using TSA. \\n3908: * The key steps to shift traffic, including traffic shifting configuration creation, dialing up traffic, and cleanup\\n3909: * Monitoring traffic shift progress and service-side metrics\\n3910: * Troubleshooting common issues\\n3911: \\n3912: Whether you're new to the Traffic Shifting Accelerator or want a refresher, this comprehensive guide has everything you need to start safely shifting traffic.\\n3913: \\n3914: ### Next Steps\\n3915: \\n3916: Now that you're familiar with the Traffic Shifting Accelerator, proceed to the Create Traffic Shifting Configurations step to begin your traffic shift process.\\n3917: \\n3918: ### Troubleshooting TSA Traffic Shifts\\n3919: \\n3920: > **_GOAL:_** By end of this lesson, you will be able to troubleshoot common traffic shifting issues encountered when using TSA.\\n3921: \\n3922: To get support, please see [the TSA trouble shooting wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/TSA/Troubleshooting).\\n3923: \\n3924: **Additional Resources**\\n3925: \\n3926: * [TSA Runbook Entry points](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Almanac/Team/Internal/Oncall/TrafficShiftingAcceleratorRunbooks)\\n3927: \\n3928: \\n3929: # Migration Milestone 4: Descale in the source region\\n3930: \\n3931: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this milestone, your service will require fewer servers in source region\\n3932: \\n3933: \\n3934: \\n3935: ## Module 14: Descale capacity\\n3936: \\n3937: Once your traffic has been running in the new region and you have passed the window of being able to safely roll back, you should descale your capacity in DUB based on the amount of traffic you migrated.\\n3938: \\n3939: Before descaling, we recommend holding onto capacity in the source region for **2 weeks** to allow workloads to go through their usual business peaks.\\n3940: \\n3941: This guide provides step-by-step instructions for descaling EC2 capacity in the DUB region. These instructions apply to both MAWS EC2 and Public EC2.\\n3942: \\n3943: This guide will walk you through the specific steps needed to complete the required descaling actions.

As our business continue to grow, there’s a need to diversify the AWS region usage to improve capacity availability. By the end of 2026 when SDO exits DUB, synchronous-to-the-customer traffic currently served from DUB will be partitioned by marketplace to one of ZAZ or FRA, with requests for a given marketplace always going to the same region as per the [[Exit DUB strategy>>url:https://wiki.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Deep_Dives_and_Announcements/Announcements/Exit_DUB_Strategy]]. This guide provides migration coordinators and tech leads the guidance on how to coordinate the sub-experience migration from DUB to other regions.\\n\\n----\\n\\n=== What is a Sub-experience? ===\\n\\nA sub-experience is a specific part of a customer's interaction with SDO offerings. It can be a section of a webpage, a particular feature, or a set of related services. Sub-experiences can be migrated independently to target regions with minimal impact on business metrics like customer perceived latency. This approach helps break down large-scale migrations into smaller, manageable steps. Sub-experiences are identified in collaboration between the feature owners and the Region Flexibility Engineering (RFE) team.\\n\\n----\\n\\n=== Who are Migration Coordinators? ===\\n\\nMigration Coordinators (MCs) are the assigned employees orchestrating the movement of a sub-experiences to new regions, and are responsible for driving it to completion. Migration Coordinators are responsible for migration of a sub-experience, **moving the traffic to that sub-experience to another region **(for example ZAZ or FRA) with minimal customer impact in terms of latency, resilience, and other business metrics. Because this requires the entire call-path of the sub-experience to be migrated, the Migration Coordinator **works across organizations and technical owners**. While migration of sub-experiences is a key element of reduction of capacity in DUB, and the final step of sub-experience migration is to signal readiness to reduce fleets in DUB, Migration Coordinators do not have a specific fleet goal, or server reduction goal. Migration Coordinators work with RFE POCs on planning of migrations, identifying pipelines which are a part of the sub-experience, supporting teams who have blockers or need escalations, and identifying risks to migrations, resilience, or latency.\\n\\n* Owns the shifting of traffic for a sub-experience to a new region.\\n* Coordinates the timing of migrations, including service migrations and data migrations.\\n* Partners with the Technical Lead for a sub-experience to identify dependency pipelines, and maintains the sub-experience plan in RFP.\\n* Minimizes the impact of migration on business metrics, and provides a plan to recover.\\n* Works across the entire call tree, regardless of organization.\\n* Identifies blockers, risks, and issues for their sub-experience, and unblocks, accelerates, and escalates as needed to RFE or RFE partners.\\n\\n----\\n\\n=== What is a DARU L3 Fleet? ===\\n\\nFleet Management is an Amazon platform which allows organizations to track ownership of AWS accounts and non-Native AWS resources in a hierarchical ownership structure. This structure is used for financial budgeting and reporting, and contains all AWS resources billed by AWS. The largest SDO fleets on the third level (Amazon → SDO → L3) are tracked by the DARU program in the CloudTune organization for their migration progress from DUB to ZAZ, as a proxy for overall migration by SDO teams in tracking the status of the STEAM Exit DUB goal. These fleets are known as DARU L3 Fleets. \\n\\n----\\n\\n=== Who are DARU SPoCs? ===\\n\\nDARU SPoCs are owners assigned by DARU L3 Fleet owners who are responsible for tracking progress and R/Y/G status for their organizations commitment to DARU STEAM goals and their organizations role in unblocking migration of sub-experiences. In 2025, the main goal is to have no more than 60% of their 10/16/24 fleet scaling in DUB on 10/16/25. The DARU SPoC works with the DARU team to establish and track an organizational eLT goal which functions as a sub-set of the Amazon STEAM goal, which aligns to the 2025 CCI. During the year, the DARU SPoC will meet with DARU to measure progress and track status of the goal. \\n\\n* Associated with a L3 DARU Fleet owner. \\n* Owns and tracks progress against a DARU Fleet reduction goal. \\n* Works with teams to prioritize unblocking sub-experiences blocked by teams in their fleet. \\n* Identifies blockers, risks, and issues their fleet poses to sub-experiences, and unblocks, accelerates, and escalates as needed to RFE or RFE partners.\\n\\n----\\n\\n=== What if they are the same person? ===\\n\\nIf the MC and the SPoC role are assigned to the same person, they need to understand the distinction and which hat they are wearing at any given time. Some organizations are using a single, or a limited set of sub-experiences, to represent their organizations migration as a set of migrating services. Even in those cases, the engagement model is different between the two roles, and it will help to stay aware of the structure. Tracking metrics and progress, reporting to leaders and updating goals, and working with DARU leading up to DARU RFP are roles associated with the DARU SPoC. Identifying sub-experience pipeline dependencies, driving planning and escalation, working outside the organization to identify and track dependencies, and helping to unblock teams and reporting on migration risks are roles associated with the Migration Coordinator. \\n\\n----\\n\\n== 1.Planning ==\\n\\n=== 1.1 Identifying your sub-experiences ===\\n\\nFor the 2025 ExitDUB migrations, SDO sub-experiences are listed in the [[region-flex portal>>url:https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/subExperiences]] (RFP). These were defined in collaboration with the Tech Leads and Migration Coordinators (MCs) of the respective experiences. As we learn through the 2025 migrations, the Tech Leads and MCs can modify the sub-experiences for future region-flex migrations. A SIM can be created using the [[provided template>>url:https://sim.amazon.com/issues/create?template=b187d5df-e331-4eab-8517-e0368a3b9c82]] for introducing a new sub-experience, altering an existing sub-experience such as changing its name, removing a sub-experience entirely, or updating the MC or Technical Lead aliases. RFP will incorporate support for these operations by Q2 2025.\\n\\\\\\\\**Best Practices for Identifying Sub-Experiences:**\\n\\n1. Prioritize customer experience and business outcomes as the guiding factor. A sub-experience can also be a cohort of services that can move together, but we prefer to think of it as an end-to-end customer experience - although not possible to achieve for some businesses.\\n1. It can be migrated independently with limited impact on business metrics. For example, in the Shopping Detail Page experience, Below-the-Fold (BTF) has different latency requirements than Above-the-Fold (ATF) and can be migrated independently. For Fulfillment Centers (FCs) it will be individual FCs.\\n1. Incoming traffic can be shifted independently. It has a 'well defined' traffic entry/starting point (URI, service, etc).\\n1. Balance the coordination cost of managing sub-experiences. Each sub-experience requires a unique plan in the region-flex portal with milestones, which will be tracked and reported separately. Teams should find the optimal number of sub-experiences.\\n\\n----\\n\\n=== 1.2 Identifying Sub-experiences scope ===\\n\\n(% class=\\\"btn-group\\\" %)\\n(((\\nMigration Coordinators (MCs) and Tech Leads (TLs) need to identify primary dependencies for their sub-experience\\n)))\\n\\n* Region Flexibility Engineering organizes and tracks Sub-Experience dependencies in terms of Amazon Pipelines which deploy code or infrastructure required for the Sub-Experience to be served from a region.\\n* It is recommended that Migration Coordinators use tooling from RFE Analytics to identify transitive dependencies for AFT, Cart, Checkout, Detail, HomePage, and Search core experiences.\\n** The source of truth for these is the (% class=\\\"wikiinternallink\\\" %)[[RFE Recommendations to Exit DUB in 2025 dashboard>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/RFE-Analytics-Dashboard/RFE-REC/]]\\n*** Downloadable information can be found near the bottom of the page under “(% style=\\\"color:#212121\\\" %)Raw Data to Export”\\n*** A csv can be downloaded directly (% class=\\\"wikiinternallink\\\" %)[[from here>>url:https://drive.corp.amazon.com/folders/Region%20Flexibility%20Analytics/Analysis_Core_Experience_Primary/V4_2024_08_30]]\\n* Sub-experiences not falling under those core experiences need to work with their tech leads and RFE Analytics by submitting a (% class=\\\"wikiinternallink\\\" %)[[SIM >>url:https://sim.amazon.com/issues/create?template=bcb83ff9-0378-4efb-8fbc-31e9f295a0ac]](%%)to identify the call chains for their core services.\\n\\n----\\n\\n=== 1.3 Planning Sub- experience Migration ===\\n\\nMigration Coordinators, in partnership with Tech Leads, are responsible for driving the movement of a sub-experience out of DUB and defining the migration effort boundaries. It is recommended to use the sub-experience name in RFP ([[Region Flex >>url:https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev]][[Portal>>url:https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev]]), specific URI routes included with the sub-experience interactions, or data interactions in the sub-experience to inform the scope definition. The Migration Coordinator will use RFP to set need by dates for all pipelines within the sub experiences and ensure that the completion dates are tracked in sync.\\n\\\\\\\\Each pipeline will use RFP as the source of truth to create the list of dependencies required for migration to the new region and align availability of those dependencies with dates set by the Migration Coordinator. The Migration Coordinator will assist in this process by providing a centralized point for escalations and consolidation of asks between teams to keep migrations moving.\\n\\n==== 1.3.1 Program Plan ====\\n\\nThe program plan and timelines for sub-experiences and associated pipelines will be tracked through [[the Region Flex Portal>>url:https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev]], with time-gated milestones for each pipeline using this document as the source of truth, as part of the overall migration plan. If a pipeline fails to meet a milestone, the miss will be visible to the migration coordinator and runbooks will be followed to provide visibility in leadership reviews and/or escalations.\\n\\nIt is recommended to develop plans that address these risks:\\n\\n* Migration Process Risks\\n** What mechanisms the sub-experience will use to identify timeline risks and ensure [[timelines for Experience migrations>>url:https://wiki.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Deep_Dives_and_Announcements/Announcements/Exit_DUB_Strategy#HWhatarethecurrentidentifiedSDOsub-experiences3F]] are met.\\n** Communications between orgs\\n* Latency Impacts\\n** [[Manage Latency Commitments>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Latency/Projects/Exemption_and_CommitmentTracker/User_Guide/]]\\n** Notification plan\\n** Rollback plan\\n* Runbook Template\\n** The runbook will address common issues and escalation points for the sub-experience.\\n** RFE has an action item to provide an example Runbook to support this area.\\n\\n----\\n\\n=== 1.4 Establishing definition of done ===\\n\\nThe Region Flexibility program defines a sub-experience migration completed when the following criteria is met: \\n\\n* All of the in-scope sub-experience’s transitive dependencies are set-up in the destination region and serving sub-experience traffic from the destination region.\\n** To achieve this, please see [[Coordinating Migration of Dependencies>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Coordinating_Migrations/#H3.1CoordinatingDependenciesMigrationWorkflow]] section.\\n* All of the in-scope sub-experience traffic is routed to the destination region.\\n** Please note, the traffic scope for your sub-experience migration is defined in the planning phase and may include one or more traffic categories (e.g. Robot customer, Human customer), one or more marketplaces (e.g., ES, UK, DE, and IN), or a percentage of the traffic served by the DUB stack. \\n** To achieve this, please see [[Traffic shifting>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Coordinating_Migrations/#H3.4TrafficShifting]] section. \\n* All of the sub-experience’s transitive dependencies have de-scaled their stacks in the originating regions appropriate to the traffic shifted to the destination region.\\n** Please note, that depending on the traffic scope of the sub-experience, its transitive dependencies may not be able to fully de-scale from the originating region. E.g., if the sub-experience is scoped to move ES, UK, DE, and IN marketplaces, its dependencies will be required to de-scale capacity serving those marketplaces, but will need to keep capacity to serve other marketplaces like FR, IT, ES, NL, and etc.\\n** To achieve this, please see [[Descaling section>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Coordinating_Migrations/#H3.5Descaling]]. \\n\\n== 2.Executing the Migration ==\\n\\nAs a Migration Coordinator, you are responsible for driving the sub-experience migration to completion. After you identify the scope of your sub-experience, create and review your migration strategy, and submit your sub-experience migration plan in the Region Flexibility Portal, you enter the execution phase of the sub-experience migration.  \\n\\nDuring this phase, the communication and ability to adapt are essential. Amazon is executing sub-experience migrations for the first time and we will face both foreseen and unforeseen challenges. Looking around corners, communicating promptly, and leveraging the support system in place will help you navigate these challenges.  This section outlines a desired success criteria and Region Flexibility / DARU guidance to reach it.\\n\\n=== 2.1 Planning the Traffic Shift ===\\n\\nAs a migration coordinator, you’re responsible for driving the migration and therefore shifting traffic for the sub-experience to destination region with the help of your tech lead. This section introduces relevant concepts and decisions that need to be made to plan the traffic shift at the next level of detail compared to your existing migration strategy doc(s).\\n\\n**Define your acceptance and escalation criteria**\\n\\nThe first step is to understand the set of metrics you’ll want to track as part of your traffic shift to ensure that nothing has gone horribly wrong, and to define thresholds after which you would seek approvals before continuing. **__Note that you should be expecting to see degradation as part of the migration, and the conversation should be around what impact is tolerable.__** The L10+ level leadership is aligned with this expectation and your role is to facilitate and enable fast turnaround when the high-judgment calls need to be made to proceed with migration at an acceptable degradation.\\n\\\\\\\\Here are a few example metrics you’ll likely want to monitor, but feel free to add or remove from this list as appropriate for your use case. If you identify a metric you want to monitor but do not have available, work with your tech lead and other leaders in your organization to understand the feasibility of adding them.\\n\\n* Business metrics: Migration Coordinators should proactively identify the business metrics which will be used in decision making for their Service and identify how they can access these metrics. Examples of business metrics include latency Financial Impact (for Shopping Core Experiences, see [[this wiki>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Latency/Analytics/FinancialImpact/]]), conversion rates, click-through rates, resilience capabilities, or traffic. MCs may need to work with business leaders and finance teams to identify business metrics. These metrics may be required when planning migration timing, making straggler service acceptance decisions, or determining how long to accept the increased latency and resilience risks of cross region operations.\\n* Availability metrics: Migration Coordinators should identify, as possible, the availability metrics which are important for their sub-experience, and establish a dashboard which allows these to be tracked. It is likely that these metrics are Error rate, Order drops, Timeouts, etc. for the service which operates as an entry-point and traffic-shifting point for the sub-experience. These metrics will, for example, be used for automated and manual rollback.\\n* Latency metrics: Identify what latency metric(s) to track ([[TM99>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/TrimmedMean/]] is most common), at what threshold you would seek oversight/approval from leadership, and who in leadership you would seek approval from.\\n** Utilize your tech lead’s help to find the right metrics to track.\\n** Review your plans for what threshold to seek oversight/approval from leadership with your leadership ahead of time, so that you’re ready if something goes wrong. Aim for a threshold that lets you keep moving within reason, and allows you to seek approval from your L8 where the latency may cause too much impact on your customers.\\n** As an example on approval chains, for Stores sub-experiences, [[Central Latency’s guidance>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Latency/Analytics/FinancialImpact/LatencyGuidanceForRegionFlex/]] is to seek an L8 approval if latency exceeds your target threshold.\\n* **Example: See below for Search’s Latency Impact Analysis ( [[link >>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Search/RegionFlex/TrafficShifting]]to Search's Traffic Shifting plan)**\\n** **Latency & Dial-up Criteria: **We will use latency targets for each increase in allocation for our traffic shifts. These targets are TM99 TTI (time to interactive) **experience impact limit** and **treatment impact guardrail**. Experience impact is the overall latency to the marketplace at the current allocation, and treatment impact is the latency impact to just customers in the traffic shift treatment. We will work with central latency to determine these thresholds and review them with leadership as part of our 2025 latency goal planning.\\n\\\\\\\\Treatment impact is measured via the [[Central Latency Portal tool>>url:https://latency.corp.amazon.com/reports/search/]], and the experience impact is the treatment impact multiplied with the treatment allocation. As an example on how we will use these values, hypothetically we might pick 20ms as our experience impact limit and 500ms as our treatment impact guardrail. The table below illustrates how this affects our dial up decision-making process where we must not exceed either latency threshold.\\n\\n                             [[image:Search Example Table.PNG]]\\n\\n\\n* WAN metrics: Familiarize yourself with the [[Network Bandwidth dashboard>>url:https://toolbelt.irm.amazon.dev/dashboards/dub-zaz-network-health]]. You’ll want to observe this before, during, and after your traffic shift. Depending on the available networking capacity as you go to execute your traffic shift MCM, you may need to escalate to RFE. Process for communicating with RFE about bandwidth needs is available [[on our wiki>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Migration_Issues_Tracker/DUB-ZAZ_NetworkUsageApprovalProcess/]]. In Q2 2025, AWS networking will launch increased capacity links for WAN connectivity between DUB, ZAZ, and FRA, which are expected to exceed SDO requirements and allow us to sunset this process.\\n\\n**Learn the mechanics of traffic shifting**\\n\\nRFE developed the sub-experience concept to allow traffic flowing through related services to migrate while minimizing the impact of migration on latency and/or availability. This is done by keeping traffic for a sub-experience in a single region as much as possible to reduce the number of cross-region calls. Achieving this in your traffic shifting strategy requires:\\n\\n1. Controlling traffic at “sub-experience entry points”.\\n1. Keeping traffic in the sub-experience in the target region. - We have developed a Local Region Affinity (LRA) routing model to make this possible, you will learn more in [[Keeping traffic in the sub-experience in the target region>>url:https://quip-amazon.com/TluNAfX7gua1#temp:C:Led9148689ce26f499abc59da91e]] section.\\n1. Overriding the target region for “straggler services” - Services that aren’t ready yet but you don’t want to block the migration.\\n\\n=== 2.2 Controlling traffic as it enters the sub-experience ===\\n\\n==== Identifying sub-experience entry points ====\\n\\n“Sub-experience entry points” are the services or URIs that bring traffic into your sub-experience. You’ll need to identify these entry points early as they’ll need a bit of extra work to be able to control traffic into your sub-experience. You will partner with your tech lead and work with other technical resources such as service owners and Principal Engineers to identify candidates for this. Be sure to consider:\\n\\n* Entry URIs where traffic comes in from the external-to-Amazon internet. For Shopping and some other experiences, these URIs come in through AERO/OPF. This also includes AJAX calls that are indirectly made via browsers. For services using OPF the URI regex can found using OPF’s [[express debug>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Online_Proxy_Fleet/ExpressDebug/]] feature. As an example, ^/hz/wishlist(./*)?$, the URI regex representing wishlist in Sweden: \\n\\n[[image:image (24).png]]\\n\\n* Specific services that control the flow of traffic into your sub-experience, which often have the highest volume of calls but are easiest to work with.\\n\\nOnce you’ve identified your entry points, make note of them in your sub-experience page in RFP.\\n\\n====== **Capabilities required from entry point traffic shifting mechanisms** ======\\n\\nThe entry point for your sub-experience should be a central point where you can assert the most control over the call graph. Strong candidates are points which can integrate with WebLab, or WebLab-like functionality like % traffic controls, analytics, event-stream integration, and technical metrics which enable automated rollbacks. Selecting a point as near to the customer as possible is recommended, where call patterns are simple and narrow, making them easy to understand, and the risk of latency impacts can be minimized.\\n\\\\\\\\If your sub-experience is filtering on an additional traffic segmentation, such as marketplace, traffic type, end user device (e.g., mobile vs web), you should work with the service owner and PEs to ensure that the service which manages your chosen entry point has access to that dimension, and can control traffic based on it.\\n\\nIf your sub-experience is part of [[CRRE coordinated peak game-days>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/RedTeam/Experiments/CoordinatedGamedays/#HHowdoIknowifmyserviceparticipatesinCoordinatedGamedays3F]], your traffic shifting must utilize a Weblab in OPF, Shopping Portal, or another system that supports [[Weblab cookie overrides>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Weblab/Components/Cookie_Overrides/]] to ensure game-day traffic is treated the same as actual peak traffic. If not using Weblab in OPF or Shopping Portal, in addition to using the [[override-aware Weblab provider>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Weblab/WeblabAllocationProvider/#HWeblab-ScopedOverrides]], you must verify the service where the Weblab is implemented receives the cookies from the original customer request. Without overrides game-day traffic may be entirely treated as robotic traffic and sent to ZAZ potentially impacting availability or compromise the game-day results. \\n\\nIf your sub-experience participates in non-CRRE-led game-days, work with the game-day organizers to understand any special handling that is needed for game-days or test traffic.\\n\\n\\n====== **Recommended entry point traffic shifting mechanisms** ======\\n\\nSub-experiences that take traffic via OPF should default to leveraging OPF Weblabs to shift traffic for the OPF URIs identified as this sub-experience entry points. Non-retail OPF customers should leverage [[existing guidance>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/OPF/Operations/SelfService/OPFWeblab]] for OPF Weblab routing. Traffic Engineering expect retail customers to be fully supported by OPF Weblabs by early Q2. Retail customers looking to shift traffic for their sub-experiences prior to that should reach out to their RFE POC.\\n\\\\\\\\Be aware of how traffic shifting can impact your latency. OPF Weblab traffic shifting will continue to accept traffic to DUB, routing that traffic to a backend in ZAZ. While this allows shifting to be done in a controlled way, the traffic continues to flow via DUB, accepting a superfluous back-and-forth cross region call, and incurring a 30ms delay (up to 60ms under network impairment conditions, or 4x the expected in case a three-way TCP handshake is needed on a particular call). In Q2, Traffic Engineering will launch the OPF Edge Router feature for OPF, which will route traffic based on Weblab in the Edge, prior to the DUB datacenter. This change is expected to eliminate the additional delay incurred by the OPF Weblabs.\\n\\\\\\\\Non-OPF sub-experiences should default to integrating with [[Weblab>>url:https://w.amazon.com/index.php/Weblab]] directly to control the shifting of traffic at the sub-experience entry point, barring any integration blockers. Other options, such as bespoke solutions, should be approached carefully, as they are high risk.\\n \\n\\n====== **Keeping traffic in the sub-experience in the target region** ======\\n\\nThis section is for your education only; no action is required by the migration coordinator.\\n\\\\\\\\Service owners have been asked to onboard to [[LRA (Local Region Affinity)>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/LRA/]] to keep calls in the same region as much they’re called in, barring intentional overrides by a service team. LRA reduces the number of cross-region hops, and thus the latency impact of the migration. A diagram of what this looks like across a small group of services follows, with the blue node serving as the sub-experience entry point where you will manage traffic routing as a migration coordinator:\\n\\n[[image:image (23).png]]\\n\\n\\nRFE started an LRA onboarding campaign in Q4’24 for Homepage, Detail page, Checkout, Cart, Core Shopping, AFT and Percolate. As of 01/15 the campaign has 1661 Policy Engine (PE) risks open and 922 LRA endpoints created. To include your sub-experience in the PE campaign, reach out to [[#lra-interest>>url:https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07DA352U9G]] (this will become self-service on RFP by 3/7). You can view the LRA campaign status for your sub-experience on the [[RFE Policy Engine Campaign Dashboard>>url:https://us-east-1.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/dashboards/3e85196c-d79b-4905-802a-56f499348561?#]].\\n \\n\\n=== 2.3 Overriding the target region for \\\"straggler services\\\" ===\\n\\nDespite all of our best efforts, there may be services that aren’t quite ready when it comes time to shift traffic or have been discovered as a dependency only after the traffic shifting began.** __In many cases you will decide to move forward with the traffic shift regardless.__** These are called “straggler services”. Service B in the diagram in the previous section is an example of a potential straggler service.\\n\\\\\\\\As a migration coordinator, you are responsible for 1) determining which services (if any) can be left behind as a straggler, 2) ensuring that straggler service has a plan to migrate as a fast follow, 3) ensuring any straggler services has the necessary routing mechanisms in place to ensure traffic gets routed back to the source region (in this case DUB), and 4) ensuring services downstream of the straggler are notified they will receive reduced or no traffic as part of the sub-experience traffic shift. We’ll cover these in more detail later in this guidance.\\n\\n=== 2.4 Determine relevant traffic types ===\\n\\nThere are three main traffic types relevant to sub-experience traffic shifts. Individual sub-experiences may receive some, or all, of these traffic types under normal conditions.\\n\\n1. Test traffic: Traffic that does not impact actual customers, typically made up of manually constructed requests, utilizing test customers, run as part of continuous canaries, or captured and played back via “shadow testing”. This type of traffic can be utilized as soon as first set of dependencies set up in the destination region and is valuable for finding problems quickly without impacting actual customers, e.g., finding timeouts that need to be adjusted, dependencies that were missed and are forcing cross-region calls or data accesses, and service-specific defects. CRRE has the ability to continuously generate browser oriented test traffic for sub-experiences related to [[some customer experiences>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/RedTeam/Services/Ovis/TrafficProfile#HExperience2FCustomerJourney:CoordinatedGamedayTraffic]] including Homepage, High Velocity Event Landing Pages, Detail Page, Search, Browse Nodes, Cart, Checkout, and Your Orders. (% style=\\\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 0)\\\" textcolor=\\\"#333333\\\" %)If you already receive traffic from coordinated gamedays, follow (% style=\\\"background-color:#ffe600\\\" %)[[this self service guide>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/RedTeam/Services/Ovis/OvisContinuousTrafficforRFEMigrations]](% style=\\\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 0)\\\" textcolor=\\\"#333333\\\" %) to enable continuous traffic generated by Ovis at low scale for your sub-experience and reach out to the (% style=\\\"background-color:#ffe600\\\" %)[[(% style=\\\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 0)\\\" textcolor=\\\"#333333\\\" %)Ovis team>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/RedTeam/Support#HTicketing]](% style=\\\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 0)\\\" textcolor=\\\"#333333\\\" %) for any help or issues.\\n1. Robot customer traffic: Automated, computer generated traffic that represents non-human interactions with our systems, such as search engine crawlers or content scrapers. Migrating this type of traffic early is valuable for driving real traffic through a sub-experience without impacting human customer facing latency. Only RM-Certain and RM-High robot types should be selected as part of this traffic. Other robot types have slight chance of incorrect classification and may impact human customers before we are ready to traffic shift for them.\\n1. Human customer traffic: Human generated traffic coming from interaction with our websites and mobile apps. Shifting this type of traffic is generally where you want to apply the most care, as increased latency or error rates at this stage can directly lead to business impact like revenue loss.\\n\\nYour tech lead will be able to provide you with the best information regarding what traffic types are applicable to your sub-experience today and how, or whether, it can be separated from other traffic. If sub-experiences do not currently have test traffic, but believe it will be beneficial, they should explore adding it.\\n\\n=== 2.5 Determine what game days to run ===\\n\\nPrior to shifting traffic, you should plan to run scaling game days, which will establish that your service is ready in the new region, and is scaled to receive traffic that you intend to shift. To minimize variance from normal process, it is recommended that you use your existing game day processes, if you have them, to test out scaling, find AWS account limit gaps, etc.\\n\\\\\\\\There are two forms of testing which can be conducted. Hybrid options, such as manual replay for logged customer calls, may provide more nuanced options, depending on the technical context.\\n\\\\\\\\**Option 1**: Create game day traffic that is tagged in a way which weblab at the sub-experience entry point can route on and configure a weblab which routes 100% of it to the new region.\\n\\n* **Advantage**: Replicates reality, possible to use existing test mechanisms.\\n* **Disadvantage**: More complex, this option will require the load testing requests to be sent to DUB, additive to organic traffic, which may strain services which are upstream of the sub-experience entry point.\\n* **Example**: The Prime Video organization have built a shadow traffic system which routes a subset of requests to ZAZ as well as DUB, replicating the load DUB receives in ZAZ without risk of impact to customers. This allows them to confirm that the two regions provide equivalent responses, as well as monitor the scaling and readiness of systems in ZAZ.\\n* **Example**: Ovis can send synthetic, browser oriented traffic to some sub-experiences (such as Detail page and Homepage). Ovis supports the use of weblab overrides via the experiment cookie which can be used to route the traffic to new regions. Reach out to the [[Ovis team>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/RedTeam/Support#HTicketing]] to see if test traffic can be generated to your sub-experience in new regions using your traffic shifting mechanism.\\n\\n**Option 2**: Create mock traffic using TPSGen or an equivalent system (technical leaders should explore other options, including DJS jobs and simply scripting curl) and send it directly into the internal endpoint for the service in ZAZ.\\n\\n* **Advantage**: This is a simpler option which can test readiness and latency behavior from ZAZ endpoints without capacity strain in DUB.\\n* **Disadvantage**: Because this data will be mocked up by human operators, it does not replicate the patterns and content of customer traffic. Additionally, this option is unlikely to utilize previously build scale testing systems.\\n\\n=== 2.6 Assemble your traffic shift schedule ===\\n\\nNext you’ll want to assemble your traffic shift schedule. Each sub-experience is expected to have their traffic shifted completely by the \\\"Traffic Shifted By\\\" date specified in the RFP sub-experience migration plan. MCs should determine the traffic shift start date and schedule with that completion date in mind, and recognize that there may need to be iteration as learnings are found over the course of the traffic shift. Based on learnings from sub-experience migrations in 2024, RFE recommends at least a month of traffic shift time. In addition to your schedule, document all Weblab IDs, the services they are added to (e.g., OPF), and override methods (e.g., are cookie overrides supported) in the Region Flexibility Portal in the Notes section.  Section 4 that follows provides additional detail that may be worth taking a look at as you build your schedule, to better understand the types of learnings that may be uncovered as part of the migration.\\n\\n==== Timing ====\\n\\nWhen planning your traffic shift schedule, be sure to consider peak days, worldwide holidays, and day of the week. [[Change control policies>>url:https://w.amazon.com/index.php/ChangeControlPolicy]] seek to address peak days and key holidays, but they may not be sufficiently forward-looking to provide the guidance you need. In this case, look to the prior year’s calendar to understand likely risks to the calendar, recognizing some events or holidays can move from year to year.\\n\\n==== Criteria and speed for traffic shifting each traffic type ====\\n\\nWhere multiple traffic types are applicable to your sub-experience, test traffic should be run before robot customer traffic is shifted, which should be traffic shifted before human customer traffic.\\n\\n1. Test traffic: As soon as you have a handful of services in your sub-experience that have declared themselves ready by completing the service migration and recorded it in RFP, you can start running test traffic to find service timeouts and tune alarms. Continue running the test traffic as more dependency services become available in the destination region until you are ready to go to the next step of robot/human traffic shift.\\n1. Robot customer traffic: When the known critical dependency services are setup in the destination region you can start robot customer traffic migration. This will help determine service timeouts and cross-region calls that need to be fixed before the human traffic migration. Robot traffic shifts should be completed within 2-days provided there are no issues. If service timeouts are discovered during the robot customer traffic shift they must be fixed before going to the next step of migrating human traffic.\\n1. Human customer traffic: Business sensitivity to customer experience dictates the timing and approach of human customer traffic shift. MCs must establish acceptable degradation thresholds with tech lead and business leaders. For sub-experiences which have high latency regression bar e.g. core shopping experiences, RFE recommends to traffic shift slowly over a week. For such sub-experiences, limit cross-region hops before shifting customer traffic, using test and robot traffic for validation. TTI regressions can be observed with human traffic even after validations and latency exemptions may be needed. For sub-experiences which have not tested or migrated robot traffic it is recommended to use the human traffic migrations for testing as well. Start as low as 0.1% traffic shift and shift to higher percentages after confirming health of sub-experience.\\n\\n==== Traffic segments ====\\n\\nTraffic segments represent a portion of a traffic in a sub-experience that could be shifted to a new region independently of other traffic segments. Examples include marketplaces, mobile vs web, and fulfillment centers. If multiple traffic segments are included as part of a single sub-experience, you’ll need to decide if you shift their traffic together or one at a time. Key considerations include:\\n\\n1. **Similarity between the segments**. How likely is it for one segment’s migration to go well and another not, or for them both to have different problems you need to concurrently dive into before continuing the traffic shift? Likely factors include how many of the same services are utilized by each segment and how much unique configuration is tied to each segment.\\n1. **Likelihood services are ready to support one traffic segment before another**. A great example of this is the IN marketplace. This marketplace has a lot of marketplace-specific features, meaning services could easily be ready for other marketplaces (e.g., ES, UK) but not ready to support IN, in which case you may want to shift traffic for IN separately from other marketplaces, to minimize the risk of needing to debug multiple different issues concurrently.\\n1. **Potential learnings.** What would you learn from shifting traffic for different traffic segments at different times, and how will it change the proceeding traffic shift? If you don’t expect to learn much that would change your future traffic shifts, it may not be worth the timeline risk introduced by splitting the traffic segments into multiple traffic shifts.\\n1. **Timeline.** Do you have time to do multiple sequential traffic shifts ahead of your planned completion date logged in RFP? If not, you’ll need to shift the traffic segments concurrently.\\n\\n==== Post-traffic shift bake time ====\\n\\nAfter migrating 100% of traffic for your sub-experience, RFE recommends holding onto capacity in the source region for up to two weeks. Within two weeks, most workloads will go through their business as usual weekday and weekend peaks, making it the recommended period to hold onto capacity in the source region before releasing capacity.\\n\\n=== 2.7 Example traffic shifting plan: Detail Page Below the Fold (BTF) ===\\n\\n**__Acceptance and escalation criteria__**: Before starting the traffic shift these metrics were decided:\\n\\n* Increase in avg. clickToInteractive by >100ms. Sample graph for IN [[desktop>>url:https://tiny.amazon.com/aq0fvqj1/iGraph]], [[mobileWeb>>url:https://tiny.amazon.com/u0yolxpr/iGraph]], [[mobileApp>>url:https://tiny.amazon.com/pvz9ysws/iGraph]].\\n* Increase in [[RW>>url:https://rtla.amazon.com/explore.do?searchField=org&org=RETAILWEBSITEEU&affectedType=FATAL&range=7200&anchorTime=1710285600&anchor=Ending&filterSets%5B0%5D%5Bname%5D=FilterSet1&filterSets%5B0%5D%5BexpressionOperator%5D=and]] or [[DPX>>url:https://rtla.amazon.com/explore.do?searchField=org&org=DPXEU&affectedType=FATAL&range=7200&anchorTime=1710285540&anchor=Ending&filterSets%5B0%5D%5Bname%5D=FilterSet1&filterSets%5B0%5D%5BexpressionOperator%5D=and]] timeouts/fatals. There shouldn't be more than 5% increase for 3 continuous data points. Alarms are already scheduled as well for RW/DPX fatals.\\n* Decrease in DPX response size. [[Metric>>url:https://tiny.amazon.com/17og22h6x/iGraph]].\\n* Significant drop in metric logging. [[Metric>>url:https://tiny.amazon.com/wyw0m226/iGraph]]. If Detail Page takes too much time to load, this can lead to timeout in returning the client side metrics back to server, which can lead to metric drop.\\n\\n__**Entry point traffic shifting mechanism**__: Weblab integration at Shopping Portal (OPF’s Edge Router feature wasn’t available at the time).\\n\\\\\\\\**__Traffic types__**: Robot and human.\\n\\\\\\\\**__Game days__**: The Datapath team ran gamedays to validate that their ZAZ setup can support the new traffic and that there alerting and monitoring is working as expected before the traffic shift.\\n\\\\\\\\__**Traffic segments**__: Shift all impacted marketplaces together.\\n\\\\\\\\__**Traffic shift schedule**__: Traffic shifts were planned to start after midnight local time in the migrating marketplace with the most customers.\\n\\\\\\\\//Robots: //As this was the first region migration for a Stores sub-experience we were extra cautious and conducted it in two phases: testing and traffic shift. In the testing phase, Control (C) and Treatment (T) groups were equally split at 50% each, using exposure control to gradually increase traffic in the DE marketplace only. This phase lasted one week, with traffic incrementally increased from 1% to 100%. After resolving issues identified during testing, the traffic shift phase began. This second phase included all in-scope marketplaces without exposure control, starting with 0.1% for T and 99.9% for C. Over 1.5 months, T was slowly increased to 100% of production traffic//. [[Weblab>>url:https://weblab.amazon.com/wl/SP_DETAIL_BTF_ROBOT_REGIONFLEX_780991]]// was used for both the testing as well as prod traffic shifts.\\n\\\\\\\\//Humans//: While robot traffic migration gave us some confidence before migrating human traffic it was not enough as robot traffic is filtered out for latency analysis. So we started human traffic migration as well in two phases similar to robots: testing and traffic shift. In the testing phase, Control (C) and Treatment (T) groups were equally split, and exposure control was used to gradually increase traffic from 5% to 50% in the DE marketplace only. Weblab reports automatically generated for human traffic helped identify and fix TTI regressions. In the traffic shift phase, all in-scope marketplaces were included. A 0.9ms TTI regression was exempted by Core Experience leadership. Starting with a 50/50 split between C and T, exposure control was gradually increased from 1% to 100%. Finally, T was slowly increased from 50% to 100% of traffic. [[Weblab>>url:https://weblab.amazon.com/wl/SP_DETAIL_BTF_REGIONFLEX_778215]] was used for both the testing as well as prod traffic shifts.\\n\\n__**Additional nuances**__**: **As one of the first migrations, experiments were run in DUB before services were set up in ZAZ. However, this was a lengthy and time-intensive process, and RFE recommends against this pattern going forward.\\n\\\\\\\\Additionally, as part of this sub-experience migration all EUIN traffic was moved to ZAZ, which will not be the norm for most sub-experiences, and was done in large part to ensure sufficient server reductions in DUB in 2024.\\n\\n=== 2.8 Example traffic shifting plan: Detail Page ES, UK, IN Marketplaces 2025 Migrations ===\\n\\n[[image:1747918914665-846.png||height=\\\"579\\\" width=\\\"2092\\\"]]\\n\\n=== 2.9 Traffic Shift Baseline Signaling ===\\n\\nSub-experience traffic shifts and experimentaion generally happens incrementally to ensure that issues and latency degradations are identified and addressed while the small % of business traffic is shifted. This also means that the sub-experience can reach a certain % of traffic shifted and decide to dial-down back to 0 given the new issues discovered, which creates a challenging situation related to double holding capacity for all sub-experience transitive dependencies during the duration of traffic shifts. To mitigate this issue, Migration Coordinators are publishing their traffic shift schedule increases, as outlined above, but are also required to signal new baseline of traffic that is permanently shifted to a new region, so that their service dependencies can safely release the associated DUB capacity. \\n\\nTo signal new traffic shift baseline to RFE, please submit a SIM following [[this template>>https://sim.amazon.com/issues/create?template=14110c13-3927-47cb-8c95-4b7dfa0988fd]]. Please note, we are working on building the traffic shift % baseline signaling in the Region Flexibility Portal and will communicate the process change when the feature is released.\\n\\n== 3. Coordinating dependencies’ migrations ==\\n\\nAs a migration coordinator, you are responsible for driving and ensuring that all dependencies of your sub-experience are set up in the destination region and ready to receive the production traffic. This section outlines workflow, processes, mechanisms, and tooling at your disposal to help you achieve this.\\n\\n=== Dependencies migration workflow ===\\n\\n1.

Adjust the scope of your sub-experience in RFP as needed.\\n1*. As you begin experimenting and traffic shifting, identify any potential missing dependencies and include them in the RFP scope of your sub-experience.\\n\\n----\\n\\n=== 3.1 Coordination Mechanisms ===\\n\\n==== 3.1.1 Support System ====\\n\\nAs a Migration Coordinator, you are not alone in this process. To help execute and unblock technical decisions, each sub-experience has an identified Technical Lead who is responsible for providing technical leadership and direction during the migration. In addition, each sub-experience has an assigned RFE POC who is responsible for supporting Migration Coordinators during the sub-experience migration execution and can help escalate and mobilize effort for dependencies in their organizations. Lastly, each sub-experience has a defined Experience Owner, who is an L8+ leader responsible for helping unblock prioritization conflicts and is there to help advise the team about business trade-offs related to migrations (e.g., what is the acceptable latency for moving human customer traffic).\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== 3.1.2 Input Metrics ====\\n\\nTo help you evaluate the status of your sub-experience migration, we recommend that you track and take action (follow-ups and escalations) based on the following input metrics and milestones for your sub-experience dependencies: \\n\\n* **Planning Completion:** Migration Coordinators should establish a need by dates for planning completion for all of their sub-experiences' transitive dependencies and track progress towards reaching 100% plans completed. Per-dependency planning completion ensures that all known dependencies are aware of the upcoming migration effort and have reserved sufficient resources to execute on their migration. Based on the current planning status of your sub-experience dependencies, you should take the recommended action as described in section 3.1.    \\n* **Traffic Shift Ready: **Migration Coordinators should ensure that all their sub-experience dependencies reach a migration state in the destination region at which they are able to serve the production traffic. Based on the current status of the dependencies readiness, you should take the recommended action as described in section 3.1. Please note, reaching readiness for 100% of your dependencies is not a pre-requisite to begin sub-experience traffic shifting and experimentation. More on this in [[Traffic Shifting>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Coordinating_Migrations/#H3.4TrafficShifting]] section. \\n* **De-scale completed:** Migration Coordinators should ensure to take the needed action so that all of the dependencies in their sub-experience de-scale after the sub-experience is dialed-up to 100% in the destination region. More on this in [[Descaling>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Coordinating_Migrations/#H3.5Descaling]] section.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== 3.1.3 Tracking Progress ====\\n\\nRFE recommends leveraging Region Flexibility Portal (RFP) for tracking sub-experience dependencies readiness per milestone. RFP provides set of oversight views that provide insight in current migration progress across all defined dependencies within a sub-experience. RFP also provides the ability to export this information in the excel format, with ownership and leadership roll-up information, to facilitate detailed project tracking per team/organization. RFE also provides analytics data to migration coordinators that can be accessed through the Dashboards in the RFP homepage or via custom queries using hubble.  \\n\\n----\\n\\n==== 3.1.4 Campaigns ====\\n\\nRFE utilizes Policy Engine(PE) campaigns to scale engagement and ensure visibility of the needed work with dependencies. Planning campaigns ensure timely notification of dependencies to plan for their work, whereas Execution campaigns notify dependencies to start their migration in time, so that they have sufficient time to complete their migrations ahead of the expected sub-experience traffic shifts. \\n\\nPlanning PE campaigns are now automatically launched for all sub-experience dependencies and Execution PE campaigns will be launched beginning in January 2025.\\n\\nTo support this process, RFE has built campaigning automation, established a partnership with the SDO Campaign Bar Raisers to ensure quality of campaigns, and established a streamlined process for campaign management. The Region Flex team currently supports creating Policy Engine (PE) campaigns to notify service owners of dependent pipeline of Migration Sub-experiences that they need to create Service plans in the Region Flex Portal (RFP) to support their Exit-DUB migrations. We have two PE campaign types: (A) PE campaigns for Non-Core Shopping Experiences and (B) PE campaigns for Core Shopping experiences (Search, Detail Page, Home Page, Cart and Checkout). Please follow [[Launching RFE Policy Engine Campaigns>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Coordinating_Migrations/Launching_Policy_Engine_Campaigns/]] procedure based on your campaign type.\\n\\nFor dependencies that are at risk or have overdue completion dates, RFE will help migration coordinators enable ticketing for their Policy Engine campaigns, to ensure the teams are notified and escalated timely.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== 3.1.5 Latency exemption and escalations ====\\n\\nMigrating services to new regions can increase customer latency due to geographic shifts, partial migrations, or specific traffic routing methods. While minimizing latency remains a priority, some increases may be unavoidable during the Exit DUB program. In these cases, MCs must consult their Tech Leads and request latency exemptions from experience owners, following established processes. Experience owners are prepared to make business-focused decisions regarding latency with a plan to reduce it over time. For Stores sub-experiences, Central Latency has implemented a streamlined approval process for latency exemptions.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== 3.1.6 Automated Leadership Emails ====\\n\\nRFE sends automated email notifications to L8 and L10 leaders with dependencies in scope of sub-experience migrations. This mechanism helps to raise awareness of the per-organizational progress towards executing on the needed migrations, highlighting at risk services, and services blocking execution of sub-experience migrations. Migration Coordinators don’t need to do any work, as these emails will be automated and managed by RFE. \\n\\n----\\n\\n==== 3.1.7 Monthly Program Review Escalations ====\\n\\nFor situations that require leadership escalation to resolve organizational prioritizes, RFE and DARU programs will enable Migration Coordinators to facilitate the needed escalation in the DARU / RF monthly program review. Migration coordinators should work with their assigned RFE POC to facilitate this process and ensure appropriate escalation management, including the invitation of the impacted leaders to the DARU / RF monthly program review.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== 3.1.8 STLT Reviews ====\\n\\nOn a quarterly basis RFE / DARU will present the program progress to the Stores Tech Leadership Team  (L10+) and a selected Digital and Other Leaders. This forum will provide an opportunity for top-down call to action across organizations, in case there are specific organizations impacting the overall program progress. \\n\\n----\\n\\n==== 3.1.9 Ad-hoc escalations ====\\n\\nWe recommend that migration coordinators escalate early and often, both to leadership that owns dependencies critical for the progress of the sub-experience migrations, as well as to DARU / RFE assigned SPOCs to help mitigate/resolve newly discovered technical or prioritization challenges. Where needed, RFE assigned SPOC can help facilitate L8+ cross-organizational escalations to ensure the sub-experience migration is unblocked. \\n\\n----\\n\\n==== 3.1.10 Status Reporting ====\\n\\nMigration Coordinators should use the Pipeline Status Overview feature in RFP to see the status of the pipelines in their sub-experience. You can also use the out of the box Hubble queries made available to us by the RFP team. These queries serve various use cases including \\\"Sub-Experience Planning Status by Leader\\\" ; \\\"Sub-Experience Planning Status by Pipelines etc.\\\" To access the queries, simply do a search for \\\"Region Flex\\\" in the Public Queries in the Workbench.  [[https:~~/~~/datacentral.a2z.com/workbench/query-explorer>>url:https://datacentral.a2z.com/workbench/query-explorer||data-sk=\\\"tooltip_parent\\\" data-stringify-link=\\\"https://datacentral.a2z.com/workbench/query-explorer\\\" delay=\\\"150\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"]]\\n\\n[[image:image (20).png]]\\n\\n== 4. Shifting Traffic ==\\n\\nThis section walks you through how you can audit when you’re ready to start the traffic shift, introduces the concept of “straggler services” that you decide to leave behind, explains how to guide relevant service owners in the traffic shift, and provides considerations for determining if you should continue traffic shifting or pause to resolve issues that arise. It also provides the Detail Page Below-the-Fold (BTF) traffic shift plan as an end-to-end example to ground the learnings.\\n\\n=== 4.1 Integrate the traffic shifting mechanism (e.g., Weblab) ===\\n\\nFor sub-experience leveraging OPF Weblabs, no additional integration will be necessary. If your sub-experience’s entry point is using Weblab directly, you’ll need to have entry-point services integrated directly with Weblab following [[their standard processes/documentation>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Weblab]].\\n\\\\\\\\When naming your weblab, please include \\\"_RF_MigrationID<RFE Sub-Experience Short ID>\\\" in your weblab name, but NOT at the beginning (which can break WLBR (WebLab Bar Raiser) routing). This will allow central teams like RFE to easily discover your weblab. Weblabs should be named SubExperienceName_ServiceName_RF_MigrationIDXYZ_SourceRegion_DestinationRegion_Year_TrafficType. For example, a region migration from DUB to ZAZ of a WidgetSeller sub-experience, which is being done in the WidgetService service, should be named WidgetSeller_WidgetService_RF_MigrationID12345_DUB_ZAZ_2025_Robots.\\n\\\\\\\\The Sub-Experience Short ID, can be found under the details section for each sub-experience available at [[https:~~/~~/ui.rfe.amazon.dev/subExperiences>>url:https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/subExperiences]].\\n\\nThis is important because you will receive a ticket if your weblab regresses customer latency on any of the core shopping experiences (Homepage, Search, Detail, Cart or Checkout) and will need experience owner approval to launch your migration. We understand that initial migrations will cause latency regressions and that in many cases the best claw back is to complete the migration as fast as possible. To that end, we provide an expedited approval process for traffic shifting weblabs which we will identify with this naming convention. The naming convention also supports automated reporting of migration induced latency impact. This is an important metric to safeguard the customer experience as we exit DUB.\\n\\nPlease review this [[Guidance on how to run experiments >>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Latency/Analytics/FinancialImpact/RegionFlex/LatencyGuidance]]that: (1) help you make data driven decisions (identify risks, blast radius) before traffic shifting, and/or (2) measure customer impact of actual traffic shifting.\\n \\n\\n=== 4.2 Audit traffic shifting readiness and identify straggler services ===\\n\\nUsing the same dashboards you’ve utilized to track your sub-experience, you’ll want to ensure services are getting ready as the start of your traffic shift schedule approaches. Now is the time where you’d look to identify the straggler services we mentioned earlier.\\n\\n==== 4.2.1 Identify potential straggler services ====\\n\\nRFE will provide a new view in [[each sub-experience page of the Region Flexibility Portal>>url:https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/]] to provide visibility on potential stragglers. This will be presented as summary stats of services that do not yet meet particular criteria - e.g., X services in this sub-experience have not attested they’re ready yet, or Y services in this sub-experience have not pointed their ZAZ LRA endpoint to ZAZ yet. These summary stats can be clicked into to get visibility on the specific services this impacted, and there will be an additional per-service table that shows the status for each pipeline that can be filtered and downloaded.\\n\\\\\\\\The currently planned set of readiness stats that will be tracked per service include:\\n\\n1. Not onboarded to connectivity solutions.\\n1. Connectivity not validated.\\n1. Not onboarded to LRA.\\n1. LRA endpoint in target region not updated.\\n1. Missing alarms/dashboards.\\n1. Not scaled up.\\n1. [Until sufficient automated checks are in place] Missing manual service owner readiness attestation.\\n\\n==== 4.2.2 Determine which services are stragglers ====\\n\\nDeciding if a service can be a straggler or not is a judgement call you’ll have to make. For each potential straggler service, your options are:\\n\\n1. **Make them a straggler**. Continue the traffic shift with the expectation of a cross-region call to the straggler. The service owner may need to take steps to ensure traffic gets back to the source region for this service, and downstreams will need to be notified.\\n1. **Disable features.** If a specific feature of a service isn’t ready, you could continue traffic shift but disable that feature in the new region until it’s ready. The service owner will need to take steps to disable this feature in the target region.\\n1. **Spawn a new sub-experience**. If a service is high enough up in the call stack, you can consider spinning it off as a separate sub-experience that starts at the potential straggler service. This decision will require you to set up the new sub-experience in RFP and identify the impacted downstream.\\n1. **Wait.** Sometimes, you just won’t be able to leave the service behind because it will lead to an unacceptable customer experience. Given the criticality of reducing servers in DUB over the next two years, this decision requires review with the RFE TPM team, who can be contacted at rfe-tpm@, and the migration of this potential straggler service will require escalation if that has not already occurred.\\n\\nSome of the considerations to weigh in deciding what to do with potential straggler services:\\n\\n1. **Placement in the sub-experience call stack. **If one of the earlier services in the call stack is a potential straggler, that means any calls that go through that service will not migrate. If a service is high up in the call stack, it may be reason to split out the sub-experience vs make the service a straggler.\\n1. **Latency impact. **If services in your sub-experience need to call cross-region to the straggler service and its dependencies, how will that impact the overall latency of your sub-experience? This is generally a factor of how many times the service is called sequentially throughout the call graph.\\n1. **Customer impact without the associated feature(s).** In some cases, a straggler service can be excluded from the call path by turning off customer features in the sub-experience. You should evaluate how the customer experience will degrade, using business metrics identified earlier in this guidance, if the feature is disabled - think of this much like a lever.\\n1. **Service readiness for other sub-experiences.** (Harder to deal with, but unlikely. The most likely version of this problem RFE expects is with IN-specific use cases, where a service was ready to handle ES + UK traffic but is not yet ready to handle IN-specific nuances.)\\n1. **Associated server count**. If this service represents a significant portion of the server count reduction your sub-experience is targeting, there is reduced value in migrating without it. This consideration will be most in play as traffic shift dates near peak events, and dependent on risks faced by other traffic shifts/hardware releases across the Exit DUB program.\\n\\nIf you need help deciding how to best progress in your migration, request a consult with rfe-tpm@.\\n\\n==== 4.2.3 Handling Approved Straggler Services in RFP ====\\n\\nCurrently all pipelines with timelines misaligned with associated sub-experience plan are flagged as at risk. If you've approved a straggler service, or for some other reason are allowing a dependency service to be out of alignment with sub-experience dates, you should create a new sub-experience called \\\"<Sub-Experience Name- Latency Insensitive> and move all such pipelines to this sub-experience. If the <Sub-Experience Name- Latency Insensitive> Region Ready By date is before 10/16/25, they will be included in the campaigns based on that need by date. If the region readiness date is after 10/16/25 they will be excluded from the 2025 migration campaigns. Longer term, RFP will add a feature to allow MCs to indicate a pipeline with a misaligned timelines is accepted.\\n\\n==== 4.2.4 Track straggler service workaround implementation ====\\n\\nOnce your straggler services have been identified, you’ll need to notify these services that they’ve been tagged as stragglers - that you intend to traffic shift without them - and that there may be urgent work for them to complete to ensure their traffic gets back to the source region. As a migration coordinator, you are responsible for ensuring this work (if there is any) is prioritized quickly to unblock your migration. RFE will provide special guidance for these services to help them understand what (if any) work is necessary.\\n\\n==== 4.2.5 Notify straggler services’ downstreams ====\\n\\nAfter your stragglers have started on any necessary workarounds, its important to notify their downstreams as well. RFP will provide an option in the straggler table of the sub-experience to notify their dependencies. Note to expect frustration in response - these teams put in the work to get ready in the target region and someone else didn’t put in the same energy.\\n\\n=== 4.3 Determine what data needs to migrate in parallel with traffic ===\\n\\nWhile many datasets will be able to replicate, cache, or via other approaches decouple data movement from traffic shifting, the exception is strongly consistent latency-sensitive data. Service owners will be provided guidance on how to identify they meet this scenario, what to do about it, and how to signal this requirement in RFP.\\n\\n=== 4.4 Create the MCM(s) ===\\n\\nYou will likely want a separate MCM for each traffic type applicable to your sub-experience. For now, we recommend starting from the MCMs used for Detail Page Below the Fold (Robots: [[MCM-98399127>>url:https://mcm.amazon.com/cms/MCM-98399127]], Humans: [[MCM-110901059>>url:https://mcm.amazon.dev/cms/MCM-110901059]]), but RFE is working on a template for you to leverage in the future.\\n\\n==== 4.4.1 Scheduling ====\\n\\nTime of day: RFE recommends to execute the MCM during the business day of the teams involved with the migration. This helps with quick debugging and help available from partner teams to understand the issues better.\\n\\n==== 4.4.2 Pre-checks ====\\n\\n* Check the RFP sub-experience plan and make sure the dependencies that you rely on for your traffic shift are available in the destination region\\n* WAN availability and available throughput. Check [[WAN dashboard>>url:https://toolbelt.irm.amazon.dev/dashboards/dub-zaz-network-health]] for current utilization and available headroom.\\n* Check blocked and advisory days in the [[change calendar>>url:http:// https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/ChangeControlPolicy/Calendar/2025]] for EUIN.\\n\\n==== 4.4.3 Monitoring ====\\n\\nAs you build out your monitoring plan, bias towards always moving forward. RFE recommends one consolidated dashboard which has all the metrics which will be monitored during the sub-experience traffic shift. All the “Carnaval Monitors” from dependencies should be added to the MCM.\\n\\n==== 4.4.4 Additional Details ====\\n\\n* All MCMs should include rfe-traffic-shift-notify@ in the “Also Notify” field. (List will be created soon!)\\n* Stores teams should include CTOS by adding the consumer-tos-team@ team in the “Also Notify” field.\\n* Rollback steps should be defined for each traffic shift increment.\\n\\n=== 4.5 Shift Traffic ===\\n\\nThe mechanics of how you shift traffic will depend on your earlier choices, but this should effectively amount to “execute the steps in your MCM”. For most MCs, this will involve adjusting treatment percentages in your Weblabs and monitoring everything you’ve outlined in your MCM. Congrats, you’re really shifting traffic now!\\n\\n=== 4.6 Debug ===\\n\\nTo help you decide what to do when something goes wrong, RFE will author a troubleshooting guide by 2/28 to walk through the most likely issues you’ll face, how to verify the underlying problem, and what steps to take. At a high-level, RFE’s recommended resolution steps will be prioritized in the order of: bring more services into the migration, pause the migration, and then leaving shifting traffic back as a path only when absolutely necessary to protect the customer experience.\\n\\n=== 4.7 Clean Up ===\\n\\nOnce you’ve shifted traffic and waited for your defined bake time, it’s time to clean up. This requires making the shift handled by your Weblab or similar mechanism permanent (e.g., changing the OPF or DNS route) and then removing any integrations put in place for that mechanism (e.g., deleting code, closing out the Weblab).\\n\\n== 5. Descaling ==\\n\\nOnce a sub-experience is determined to be stable for sufficient time in production - generally recommended to be two weeks, to provide time to observe regular patterns of business - the migration coordinator will signal to RFE that a sub-experience is ready for descaling, which will lead to an RFE-driven communication to service owners in that sub-experience to scale down and release hardware. For some service owners, this process is automatic - e.g., if they leverage Scaling Planner in MAWS or leverage any of AWS’ auto-scaling technologies. In others, RFE will look to leverage campaigns to drive the descaling.\\n\\nNote: Service owners will generally not be deleting environments in DUB until 2026. Doing so requires all traffic for the service to move, which most services are not doing in 2025.\\n\\n== 6.Future Migrations ==\\n\\nAfter your initial migration, subsequent migrations will follow slightly different patterns.\\n\\n=== 6.1 Second (or third, or...) migration to the same region ===\\n\\nFollow up migrations of the same sub-experience, for example when a team moves IE to ZAZ in 2026, should be much quicker than the initial migration of moving UK to ZAZ in 2025. In this scenario, builders will not need to set up infrastructure, and may not need to make changes to make their data accessible - it depends on their data strategy. Teams will have worked through details like timeouts, speeding up the sub-experience testing cycle, and the dial up will primarily want to test region-specific features and configuration.\\n\\n=== 6.2 Migration to an additional region ===\\n\\nThis process will feel fairly similar to the first region migration you lead. Teams should not have to repeat the pre-requisites if they were addressed ahead of the first migration, but otherwise they need to set up infrastructure, make their data accessible, test any configuration not previously tested, and scale. The expectation is that some of the steps will be easier on teams, if they've made the expected steps towards increased region flexibility in their first migration. The sub-experience testing cycle should be a bit faster, given teams have worked through issues like timeout management (assuming similar timeouts between source and destination regions) and learned a bit about how to operate in multiple regions.\\n\\n== Contacts Us ==\\n\\nThe first recommendation is check the [[RFE Contact Us page>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/ContactUs/]], since that's our consolidated area.\\n\\n==== Office Hours ====\\n\\n[[Scheduling time during our office hours>>https://office-hour-scheduler.tools.aws.dev/schedule/703f728e-1de8-4c4a-aeab-87fb03f1b018]] is the best way to get dedicated 1:1 support for any questions you have about Region Flexibility.

Traditionally TPMs use tools such as Quip to track dependencies but Quip doesn’t scale to the requirements of Exit DUB. Detail Page, for example, has 5K+ direct and transitive dependencies. When the dependencies have been added to the Sub-Experience Migration Plan, RFP will automatically show which pipelines have committed to the need-by date and which ones still need alignment. RFP will provide mechanisms (Policy Engine) that help to gain that alignment at scale.\\n* Services/Pipelines: Dram (as an example) may have multiple sub-experiences that call it as a dependency. Instead of Dram notifying each sub-experience claiming them as a dependency, Dram will be able to place a ZAZ availability commitment date in RFP that will be visible to anyone in SDO. Features that allow updates or links to Kingpin goals have also been requested to streamline communication.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== When do I use a SEP (Sub-Experience Plan)? ====\\n\\nA SEP is necessary when a pipeline grouping (such as a customer facing experience like Homepage) does not have a central Bindle or pipeline to work off of, but needs to coordinate movement out of DUB.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== When do I use a SMP (Service Migration Plan)? ====\\n\\nService migration plans should be used with Individual pipelines needing to create an RFP. All pipelines moving out of DUB should eventually have Service Migration Plans.\\n\\n* (((\\n* Individuals are able to create a migration plan for any pipeline residing in a Bindle they are an owner of. \\n* The RFP MP has the capability to automatically populate dependencies based upon service graph information. Auto-population of dependencies does not exist within the SEP framework.\\n* Pipelines are only able to be in one MP as the MP dictates the timelines, steps taken to migrate the pipeline, and other sensors that RFP will later include specific to pipelines.\\n)))\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== How do I use a SEP? ====\\n\\n* RFP entry for each sub-experience listed in the (% class=\\\"wikiinternallink\\\" %)[[wiki >>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Experiences/]](%%)have already been created. If MCs need a new sub-experience not listed in the wiki, they can create a sub-experience plan with assistance from RFE by submitting a (% class=\\\"wikiinternallink\\\" %)[[SIM Request>>url:https://sim.amazon.com/issues/create?template=b187d5df-e331-4eab-8517-e0368a3b9c82]](%%).\\n* Open the sub-experience in RFP from (% class=\\\"wikiinternallink\\\" %)[[https:~~/~~/ui.rfe.amazon.dev/subExperiences>>url:https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/subExperiences]]\\n* Populate the sub-experience plan with with pipelines by using the IMPORT button and uploading data from the Analytics dashboard. RFP validates each line/pipeline in the file so will take quite a while.\\n** The sub-experience migration plan does not have the capability to auto-populate dependencies the way that the standard Migration Plan does. \\n** It is recommended that all transitive dependencies are loaded into the sub-experience migration plan so that the pipelines are tagged as being part of that sub-experience\\n** Data must be in CSV format, with two columns and no headers.\\n*** Column 1: Pipeline\\n*** Column 2: Required for experience TRUE or FALSE\\n** Pipelines can be added to multiple SEPs without issue and it is actually recommended so that services are able to see their criticality.\\n* Alternatively, you can manage sub-experience plan pipelines by manually searching and filtering within RFP to bulk select and add pipelines to the scope of the sub-experience. They can use a combination of these controls to scope their pipelines for the sub-experience plan.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== How do I request to create a new-sub experience? ====\\n\\nStep 1 : Submit a new sub-experience creation request using this SIM[[ template>>https://sim.amazon.com/issues/create?template=b187d5df-e331-4eab-8517-e0368a3b9c82]]. Answer all questions in the SIM.\\nStep 2: rfe-oncall will assign the SIM to respective Region Flex POC.\\nStep 3: RFE POC will verify all required fields and details. They will reach out if additional information is needed.\\n\\nStep 4: RFE POC will create the new sub-experience and comment on the ticket once done. \\n\\nStep 5: The ticket will now be closed. Any further changes will require to submit a new SIM request.\\n\\nRFE PMO will respond to the SIM within 2 business days.\\n\\nPlease note all pipelines added to this sub-experience will automatically receive Policy Engine Risks and tickets to create a service migration plan via existing violation type.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== We discovered additional dependencies and want to add them to our existing sub-experience plan. How do we include them in the Policy Engine campaign? ====\\n\\nFor any additional dependencies you discovered after initial planning, follow the process below:\\n\\n* Add them to your sub-experience plan in RFP as soon as you discover them.\\n* Notify them over email and/or cut a SIM ticket in their CTI (if they have a intake process) before the RFE campaign kicks off.\\n* Automated PE risks will be issued by RFE (usually within 24 hours).\\n* They will be included in the next bi-weekly L8 leaders email notification from RFP and looped into the regular workflow.\\n\\nPlease note- all pipelines added to the existing sub-experience or in a new sub-experience will automatically receive Policy Engine Risks via the existing violation type. If you are adding more than 500 new pipelines to the sub-experience and want to  run a separate Policy Engine campaign by creating a new sub-experience for this additional scope, please reach out to your RFE POC. We will require  i) Your team's SIM Link for support (SIM template or Ticket Template) & ii) Wiki Link (Program Wiki) to include in the PE campaign.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== An owning SDM identified that dependencies which are currently in the sub-experience shouldn't be. How and when do we remove them? ====\\n\\nPipelines can be removed from a sub-experience by the Migration Coordinator or Technical Lead at any time using the edit feature in RFP. If an SDM owner of a pipeline asserts that their pipeline may not actually be a dependency, the Migration Coordinator and Technical Lead should investigate, and make a high judgement decision of whether it is safe to remove the pipeline from the sub-experience. This decision should be made in cooperation with the requesting SDM, marshaling the right expertise and establishing sufficient confidence that the pipeline does not actually constitute a migration risk for the service.\\n\\n~1. Pipeline owners (SDMs/Builders) who receive a violation and do not believe that they are a dependency should cut a ticket to the MC (links to templates and quicklinks are included in the PE violation contactURL field) or RFE using the link in the PE violation, or [[this quicklink>>https://sim.amazon.com/issues/create?template=1c116a08-1719-46d7-8983-92d3604ce790]].\\n\\n    ~* RFE recognizes that requesting these may be centralized to reduce churn, but the process does not require it because not everyone has this support. There is nothing wrong with a SPOC or other TPM cutting a larger list on behalf of the org in a single ticket.\\n\\n2. RFE TPM oncall will assign this to the Migration Coordinator for the sub-experience (@chapanir, @shantsr, or @nsandber)\\n\\n3. Sub-experience MC, TL, and the requesting SDM, will work together to establish enough confidence that the dependency is, or is not, real.\\n\\n4. Based on the outcome of analysis, the MC should note the outcome on the ticket and, if appropriate, remove the pipeline from the sub-experience, or move it to a latency tolerant sub-experience.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== How do I request for a change in my Sub-Experience Work Back schedule? ====\\n\\nThe work back schedule dates in the RFP is locked as of 1/30/2025. \\n\\nTo request for a revised timeline, \\n\\n1.

Please make sure you communicate the upcoming changes to all dependencies and get alignment.\\n1. RFE PMO on-call will assign the SIM to appropriate RFE TPM POC.\\n1. RFE TPM POC will verify all dependencies are aligned and new timelines are within the required deadline. They will reach out if additional information is needed.\\n1. RFE TPM POC will update the sub-experience plan in RFP and comment on the ticket once done.\\n1. The new schedule will now be locked and SIM will be closed.\\n1.

RFE is providing a [[Sub-Experience Migration Strateg>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Experiences/sub-experience_migration_strategy/]]y as part of the documentation set available to SDO. There is also a [[Migration Coordinator Dependency Workflow (in draft)>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Coordinating_Migrations/MC_Workflow]] available to assist in dependency tracking.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== What tooling is available to help me, as a migration coordinator, deal with this complexity? ====\\n\\nRFE is an in-flight program and constantly iterating to improve the quality of enabling tools. Our strongest tool for this topic is going to be the [[Region Flexibility Portal (RFP)>>https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/]]. [[Here >>https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/1236638 ]]is a demo of RFP.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== What Sub-Experiences exist today? ====\\n\\nFor currently identified list of sub-experiences, see [[here>>https://wiki.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Deep_Dives_and_Announcements/Announcements/Exit_DUB_Strategy#HWhatarethecurrentidentifiedSDOsub-experiences3F]]. \\n\\n----\\n\\n==== What is required in a migration strategy? ====\\n\\nThe migration strategy may vary from service to service. RFE suggest that MCs use this migration strategy [[template>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Experiences/sub-experience_migration_strategy/]] as a starting point and iterate on the plan in collaboration with the RFE POC.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== What is the Region Flex Portal (RFP)? ====\\n\\nRFP is a one stop shop for migrations and integrations with dependency data analytics and migrations accelerators. RFP aim to unify everything service owners need to know and do for their regional migrations in this portal. See [[RFP demo>>https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/1236638]] to learn more about the tool.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== How do I fill the RFP [[sub-experience plan>>https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/subExperiences]]? ====\\n\\nMC and TechLeads have permissions to input and edit the RFP sub-experience plan for their area. Follow the instructions [[here >>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Portal/User_Guide/#HSub-ExperienceMigrationPlans]]to get clarity on what is required as part of the RFP plan.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== How do I find out which sub-experiences depend on my pipeline? ====\\n\\nThere are multiple ways to find out which sub-experiences depend on your pipeline in [[RFP >>https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/]]. The landing page has pipelines with \\\"Associated Sub-Experience(s)\\\". You can also use the [[Debugging Tool>>https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/debuggingTools]] to query your pipeline and find the sub-experiences associated with it. The pipeline name is case-sensitive and should match the exact pipeline name as in the [[pipeline tool>>https://pipelines.amazon.com/pipelines]].\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== How should teams without identified sub-experiences plan their migration? ====\\n\\nTeams without identified sub-experiences should plan for the 40% reduction goal and ensure that they do not block other sub-experience migrations. The planning [[dashboard >>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/RFE-Analytics-Dashboard/RFE-REC/]]from RFE provides the recommended services to migrate.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== What are the incremental traffic shift dial-up dates for the top-5 Shopping experiences? ====\\n\\n(% class=\\\"chat-alignment\\\" %)\\n(((\\n(% class=\\\"awsui_text-content_6absk_1e02k_142\\\" %)\\n(((\\n(% class=\\\"animated-bubble-text-container\\\" %)\\n(((\\n(((\\n(((\\nThe traffic shift dates for Shopping experiences are specified in the RFP sub-experience plan, which includes the start and end dates. However, RFP does not currently track incremental dial-up dates. Different Shopping teams use various methods to monitor their specific dial-up dates. For example, the Search team keeps track of their dates on a [[wiki>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Search/RegionFlex/TrafficShifting#HAppendix3TrafficShiftingDetails]], while the Detail Page team maintains their schedule on a separate [[wiki>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Users/vpasupat/Quip/RFE-DetailPageSubexperiencemigrations-Executionstrategy#HExitDUB:Detailpagetrafficshiftmilestonesummary:]]. A consolidated table for all core Stores Experiences is maintained in [[this quip>>https://quip-amazon.com/PR9jAT0sDN7z/Recurring-sync-Stores-ExitDUB-migration#temp:C:VUM23bf32424e814004b928932e5]]. \\n)))\\n)))\\n)))\\n)))\\n)))\\n\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== Can teams split their sub-experiences into more granular groupings? ====\\n\\nYes, the RFE team encourages breaking down sub-experiences into more meaningful, separately migratable groupings if that makes sense for the team. We are all learning and adapting as we make this journey.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== Can you make changes to optimize the sub-experience list? ====\\n\\nAbsolutely. But please work with your RFE POC and migration coordinator for any changes to ensure all related artifacts are properly updated.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== How do I get visibility into non-EC2 server capacity that my services are using? ====\\n\\nYou can get that data from [[DARU's RF planning dashboard>>https://us-east-1.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/dashboards/920605f0-b871-449a-bcdd-914c6155e83e?#]]. For any question on data post on #daru slack channel.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== What is the difference between sub-experience migration plan and service migration plan in RFP? ====\\n\\nAs a MC you must create a \\\"[[Sub-Experience migration plan>>https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/subExperiences]]\\\" for your assigned sub-experiences. Within your sub-experience plan, you will set the prescribed workback schedule for teams/services in scope for migration. You will also select the pipelines that should be in scope for migration for your organization. From there, the expectation is the teams that own those pipelines create a \\\"[[Service migration plan>>https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/]]\\\", where they configure the exact set of resources they plan to migrate together for which they will then execute the migration for. Service level plans require you to select a parent bindle, but this parent bindle is specifically for where the bindle resource for the migration plan itself will exist.  When creating a service migration plan, RFP creates a new bindle resource for the migration plan to allow you to manage permission on your plan itself.  For example, if customers want to create a service migration plan and ensure that their whole team has access to view and action the migration plan.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== What is the expected latency of the DUB<>ZAZ WAN link that I should plan for cross-region calls? ====\\n\\n(% style=\\\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px\\\" %)We are observing steady state avg 30ms round trip latency between DUB and ZAZ. But WAN has frequent planned/unplanned maintenance and in maintenance scenarios the latency can increase up to avg 60ms. So we strongly advise teams to plan for 60ms cross-region round trip latency between DUB and ZAZ.

However, where there is a significant change to architecture of the service (e.g. AuthNZ technology) security recommends to do so. In addition, security recommends that all applications comply with the ongoing re-certification campaigns, but not tied to the region migration directly.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== What is the Exit DUB strategy changes due to addition of new marketplaces? ====\\n\\nThe France (FR) and Italy (IT) Stores marketplaces will now migrate to ZAZ by 10/16/2025, previously planned for migration in 2026 to FRA. The experiences included in the scope of migration are Homepage, Detail Page, Search, Cart, Checkout, as well as Ads. This change in approach is necessary to ensure capacity supportability. In addition, this change strategically drives Stores to exercise and accelerate region flexibility capabilities. In addition to this, the partial migration of German (DE) marketplace to FRA is delayed to post 10/16/2025, and will not contribute to 2025 peak capacity reductions in DUB. The region readiness need-by date for all sub-experiences supporting 2025 DE migrations to FRA is now updated to 10/30/2025 in Region Flexibility Portal and work back schedule is adjusted accordingly. This change in approach is necessary due to the timing of WAN network capacity buildout now aiming at 9/30/2025 for operational traffic, coupled with supply chain issues impacting some hardware delivery, which makes the completion of DE marketplace migrations infeasible prior to the Q4’25 EUIN peak.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== If FRA is not considered for 2025 reduction goal, does that mean teams should push FRA region readiness to 2026? ====\\n\\nNo, we still require teams to continue FRA region readiness. As mentioned above, this change in approach was necessary due to the timing of WAN network capacity buildout now aiming at 9/30/2025 for operational traffic, coupled with supply chain issues impacting some hardware delivery, which makes the completion of DE marketplace migrations infeasible prior to the Q4’25 EUIN peak. To mitigate these risks, we have updated the FRA region readiness dates for all sub-experiences to 10/30/2025. Teams should keep the momentum and plan to start shifting traffic to FRA in Nov/ Dec 2025. This will also help us stay on track for our 100% DUB exit goal for 2026.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== What are the impediments for migrating to FRA before full bandwidth is available by 9/30? ====\\n\\n1. DUB-FRA WAN is limited to 300 Gbps until 9/30. Teams that want to operate in FRA must follow WAN network usage approval [[process>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Migration_Issues_Tracker/DUB-ZAZ_NetworkUsageApprovalProcess/]].\\n1. Upper bound supportability for symmetrical capacity (at least 3 AZs) is at 50k servers for Q4’25 peak. The current FRA usage is around 20k servers.\\n1. Foundational services such as Sable, Datapath, and Amazon API are not available in region until 6/30 – these dates may change based on the new guidance, but no later than 10/30. You can see the latest dates in this [[wiki>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Regions/Services/]]. \\n\\n----\\n\\n==== What is RFE's guidance for descaling based on sub-experience traffic shifting? ====\\n\\nRFE is running a descaling campaign in DUB to reduce capacity for services which have migrated to ZAZ. Details of the campaign are [[here>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CloudTune/CapacityManagementPlanning/Campaigns/DARU2025MigrationDescale]]. The DUB EC2 capacity descaling requires immediate attention to reduce the Q4'25 server footprint to 60% of Q4'24 levels, particularly focusing on sub-experiences that are undergoing traffic shifts. PE risks are generated for EC2 resource owners in DUB whose resources show a 2-week average CPU utilization running either 5% below their February 2025 baseline (for existing resources) or below 55% (for new resources). This campaign applies to all pipelines in DUB, including both MAWS and Public EC2 usage, regardless of Region Flex Portal (RFP) plans. The 2-week average CPU utilization measurement provides a built-in grace period, allowing sub-experience owners to adjust their dialup based on learnings during the traffics shifting. **NOTE**: Service owners should not wait for a signal from sub-experience MCs/TLs for descaling. Service Owners should act on the PE risk and descale with assumption that traffic will not be rolled back to DUB. We are past the point of return on these migrations and must roll forward. \\n\\n----\\n\\n==== Are there learnings from ongoing/completed migrations that I can check? ====\\n\\n(% style=\\\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px\\\" %)Yes, refer to these links for learnings: [[Detail Page BTF>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Latency/Analytics/FinancialImpact/RegionFlex/DetailBTF/]], [[Search Robots>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Latency/Analytics/FinancialImpact/RegionFlex/SearchRobot]], [[Homepage>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Latency/Analytics/FinancialImpact/RegionFlex/HomepageDram]], [[CASE in ZAZ>>https://quip-amazon.com/9tXLAUnrnCV3/CASE-in-ZAZ-Launch-Learnings]].\\n\\n----\\n\\n== Policy Engine Campaign FAQs ==\\n\\n==== What is the process to launch a Policy Engine Campaign for Region Flex? ====\\n\\nSee [[Launching Policy Engine Campaigns>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Coordinating_Migrations/Launching_Policy_Engine_Campaigns/]]. \\n\\n----\\n\\n==== Where can I find active and upcoming campaigns? ====\\n\\nSee [[Launched and Upcoming PE campaigns>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/ProgramManagement/RegionFlexCampaigns]].\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== When will the planning PE risk close once the plan is created in RFP? ====\\n\\nOnce the plan is created, PE risk should close within 24-48 hours.\\n\\n----\\n\\n= Sub-Experience Traffic Shift Completion Stories/ Lesson Learned/ Insights =\\n\\n(% class=\\\"table-hover\\\" %)\\n|(% style=\\\"background-color:lightblue; text-align:left; width:225px\\\" %)**Sub-Experience Name**|(% style=\\\"background-color:lightblue; text-align:left; width:151px\\\" %)**Migration Complete**|(% style=\\\"background-color:lightblue; text-align:left; width:132px\\\" %)**Presenter**|(% style=\\\"background-color:lightblue; text-align:left; width:120px\\\" %)**Date**|(% style=\\\"background-color:lightblue; text-align:left; width:203px\\\" %)**Presentation Link**|(% style=\\\"background-color:lightblue; text-align:left; width:765px\\\" %)**TWIST Link**\\n|(% style=\\\"width:225px\\\" %)Prime Video|(% style=\\\"width:151px\\\" %)2/3/2025|(% style=\\\"width:132px\\\" %)ayk@|(% style=\\\"width:120px\\\" %)2/18/2025|(% style=\\\"width:203px\\\" %)[[Link>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CRRE/PMO/TWiST/Agenda/2025-02-18/#HSuccessStory:PrimeVideo-PilottrafficshiftfromDUBtoZAZ]]|(% style=\\\"width:765px\\\" %)[[Prime Video - Pilot traffic shift from DUB to ZAZ>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CRRE/PMO/TWiST/Agenda/2025-02-18/#HSuccessStory:PrimeVideo-PilottrafficshiftfromDUBtoZAZ]]\\n|(% style=\\\"width:225px\\\" %)Detail page- BTF - Robot Traffic|(% style=\\\"width:151px\\\" %)2/12/2025|(% style=\\\"width:132px\\\" %)vpasupat@ & amindhru@|(% style=\\\"width:120px\\\" %)2/18/2025|(% style=\\\"width:203px\\\" %)[[Link>>url:https://amazon.awsapps.com/workdocs-amazon/index.html#/document/5748833880a98ed90c63296be39ec7b7f7bd9b2fab26c256f30d5d3962ee1602]]|(% style=\\\"width:765px\\\" %)[[Detail Page - BTF-Robot traffic for UK, ES served from ZAZ>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CRRE/PMO/TWiST/Agenda/2025-02-18/#HSuccessStory:DetailPage-BTF-RobottrafficforUK2CESservedfromZAZ]]\\n|(% style=\\\"width:225px\\\" %)Homepage - Robot Traffic |(% style=\\\"width:151px\\\" %)1/31/2025|(% style=\\\"width:132px\\\" %)[[blasum@>>https://phonetool.amazon.com/users/blasum]]|(% style=\\\"width:120px\\\" %)5/7/2025|(% style=\\\"width:203px\\\" %)[[Link>>https://amazon.awsapps.com/workdocs-amazon/index.html#/document/8b64cde3d2fc55f28afa4542efb7e695dc00ac1d2ee61767f9d20a42acb8fe40]]|(% style=\\\"width:765px\\\" %)N/A (Presented in MC-TL Sync).

It’s here to guide you through where to make changes to become region flexible - this will not be Amazon’s last region migration and we need to make it easier to move into additional regions - and where, based on the tooling available today, it makes sense to focus specifically on the current migration - exiting eu-west-1/DUB into eu-south2/ZAZ and eu-central-1/FRA by end of year 2026.\\n  24: \\n  25: ## How to identify your destination region(s)?\\n  26: \\n  27: By default, plan to set up your service and datasets in both eu-south-2/ZAZ and eu-central-1/FRA. If you meet any of the following, you can instead set up in only one of those regions, which should be ZAZ in most cases due to capacity availability:\\n  28: \\n  29: 1. Your service does not impact the synchronous-to-the-customer latency / availability of marketplaces, or of another partitioning strategy that is being distributed across both ZAZ and FRA.\\n  30: 2. Your service requires strongly consistent EU-wide data to be co-located to function properly.\\n  31: \\n  32: If you meet one or more of these criteria and choose to set up in only one region, but you have dependencies in multiple regions, your service is taking on the burden of ensuring requests to/from your service are routed to the correct region. You will need to utilize custom routing logic and/or onboarding to additional solutions to achieve this.\\n  33: \\n  34: If you are still unclear on where your service needs to set up, work with tech leads in your organization.\\n  35: \\n  36: ## What are the high-level milestones required to get into a new region?\\n  37: \\n  38: ![HighLevelMilestones.png](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/guidance_introduction/HighLevelMilestones.png)\\n  39: \\n  40: We suggest the Pre-Migration milestones be done in parallel, and migration milestones be completed in sequence.\\n  41: \\n  42: ## Document your migration process as you go\\n  43: \\n  44: As you work through your migration, document the changes you make in a wiki and reference it from your team documentation so that you can find it later. This will be invaluable for your team when we get to the next region migration.\\n  45: \\n  46: ## Don’t be afraid of asking for help\\n  47: \\n  48: This work isn’t something most Amazon builders have done before, and we know folks may need help. If you find yourself stuck and your team isn’t able to help you figure it out, we have a range of Slack channels, office hours, and Sage tags to get you the help you need. Don’t be afraid of [reaching out](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/ContactUs/) for help.\\n  49: \\n  50: ## Give us feedback!\\n  51: \\n  52: If you find any documentation that needs updating, share your feedback via our [content update process](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Portal/Updating_Migration_Guidance_Content/). This ensures we can help other builders avoid running into the same problems.\\n  53: \\n  54: ## Glossary\\n  55: \\n  56: This glossary outlines a handful of terms that will be used throughout this guidance. Other terms may be presented in specific sections where they are relevant.\\n  57: \\n  58: * **Source region**: the AWS region your service and data are migrating from. E.g., eu-west-1/DUB.\\n  59: * **Destination region**: the AWS region your service and data are migrating to. E.g., eu-central-1/FRA.\\n  60: * **Caller**: A service that calls other services.\\n  61: * **Callee**: A service that receives a call from other services.\\n  62: * **Sub-experience**: A portion of a page or experience that can be migrated independently from other portions of that page or experience with limited impact on customer-impacting latency and availability. You can find the currently defined sub-experiences [here](https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/subExperiences).\\n  63: * **Migration coordinator**: A person tasked with orchestrating the movement of a particular (set of) sub-experience(s) to new regions. This person must work across organizations and technical owners to drive the migration of the entire call path of the sub-experience(s).\\n  64: \\n  65: \\n  66: # Pre-migration Milestone 1: Unblock your dependencies\\n  67: \\n  68: > **_GOAL:_** After completing this milestone, your dependent services will be unblocked from setting up their infrastructure in the target region.\\n  69: \\n  70: As a service owner, you may have clients who want to move to ZAZ. You're also working on migrating to ZAZ, but you don't want to be stuck in a lockstep. To work around this, we want to unblock your clients in the new region.\\n  71: \\n  72: Setting up the necessary infrastructure in the destination region can take time, and we don't want your callers to be blocked from testing their stacks if they migrate before you do.\\n  73: \\n  74: Suppose that you own service B, and you want to unblock service A. Each service will be moving in their own timeline. We are assuming that Services A and B are Coral Services, but that is not a prerequisite.\\n  75: \\n  76: ![1706216193646-566.png](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/unblock_your_dependencies/1706216193646-566.png)\\n  77: \\n  78: If your callers (upstream) dependencies deploy their stacks in the destination region (ZAZ) before you do, they won't be able to call your service.\\n  79: \\n  80: We recommend service owners to enable their services in the destination region through cross-regional calls before deploying their stacks (we will review how this can be accomplished in Lesson 1.2). \\n  81: \\n  82: At the end of this milestone, your endpoints in the source region (DUB) will be accessible from the destination region (ZAZ). Services deployed in the ZAZ region will start to use your endpoints in DUB through cross-regional calls.\\n  83: \\n  84: ![zaz-dub-forwarding.png](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/unblock_your_dependencies/zaz-dub-forwarding.png)\\n  85: \\n  86: ## Module 1: Cross-region connectivity + routing\\n  87: \\n  88: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this module, your service will be able to be called from and make calls to services in other regions.\\n  89: \\n  90: \\n  91: \\n  92: ### Lesson 1.1: Onboard your Callee Service to LRA\\n  93: \\n  94: > **_GOAL:_** After completing this lesson, you will have unblocked your callers from calling your service from the destination region\\n  95: \\n  96: By onboarding to Local Region Affinity (LRA), you are enabling your dependent services (callers) to deploy in the new region and call your service (callee) before your service moves to the new region. Without LRA, your callers will either have to override your service endpoint in their code or cut you tickets to update your service’s client configurations in the new region.\\n  97: \\n  98: LRA introduces an abstraction between callers that call another service (callees). After making one-time LRA onboarding changes, callee services can modify their regional endpoints without needing their callers to take actions. LRA provides callee services with  `{service}.lra.amazon` LRA endpoints. Callees then use a new qualifier to access your client configuration (e.g., using a Coral config key like “Base.Prod.LRA”) or directly in the service code (if they have hardcoded their service endpoints). The callee service builder configures how the LRA endpoint resolves to their regional endpoints based on the region of the caller, e.g. the endpoint can point at their DUB stack until their ZAZ stack is set up, and then shift traffic without having to coordinate with callers. LRA abstracts the caller and callee services from how and where the actual resolutions happen. As an example, here's what the change will look like in client config for a sample Coral service called FooService:\\n  99: \\n 100: ```\\n 101: FooService#Base.LRA.Prod : {\\n 102:     \\\"httpEndpoint\\\" : {\\n 103:         \\\"url\\\" : \\\"https://prod.foo.lra.amazon:443/\\\"\\n 104:     }\\n 105: }\\n 106: ```\\n 107: \\n 108: Here is another example of how the change will look in a Brazil-config-based client config for FooService:\\n 109: \\n 110: ```\\n 111: prod.*.BSFSRHttpConnectionInfo.FooService.LRA = {\\n 112:     server = \\\"prod.foo.lra.amazon\\\";\\n 113:     port = 443;\\n 114:     path = \\\"/bsf/\\\";\\n 115: };\\n 116: ```\\n 117: \\n 118: Visit [LRA Onboarding](https://servicelens.jumpstart.amazon.dev/#/lra/onboard) to onboard your service to LRA.\\n 119: \\n 120: \\n 121: ### Lesson 1.2: LRA Caller Adoption Guidelines\\n 122: \\n 123: > **_GOAL:_** After completing this lesson, you’ll be able to make changes to your service to call Local Region Affinity (LRA) endpoints of your dependencies.\\n 124: \\n 125: Region Flexibility Engineering (RFE) is formalizing stay-in-region the default behavior by replacing region-specific endpoints with region-agnostic Local Region Affinity (LRA) endpoints starting in new-to-SDO regions.  Onboarding to LRA endpoints eliminates the need to update endpoint client-configurations for future region migrations. In this lesson, you will configure your service (Caller service) to call the LRA endpoints of services it depends on (Callee services)\\n 126: \\n 127: #### 1- Logical Flow\\n 128: \\n 129: 1. **Update your endpoint selection**\\n 130:     a. If you’re a Java Coral Caller calling Coral Callees, refer to the **Guidelines for Java Services Calling Coral Services** section.\\n 131:     b. If you’re a Java Caller calling non-Coral Callees, refer to **Guidelines for Java Services Calling non-Coral Services**\\n 132:     c. For other frameworks, you must inspect your code to find client initialization of your dependencies, and update your endpoint selection to use your dependency's  LRA endpoint. See **Updating endpoint selection for other services section**.\\n 133: 3. **Validate your build is successful**\\n 134:     a. After making the changes to adopt LRA, your build should succeed. It is expected that some of your dependencies are not onboarded to LRA.\\n 135:     b. We’ve included lessons on how to debug related failures in later lessons where you’ll be deploying your service.\\n 136: \\n 137: #### 2- Guidelines for Java Services Calling Coral Services\\n 138: \\n 139: RFE has introduced the LRA Transformer (LRACoralConfigHelper) to help Java Coral callers adopt LRA endpoints without code changes. This library provides a default endpoint selection mechanism during Coral client instantiation. This library has been integrated with CoralClientBuilder as a service instrument, which automatically:\\n 140: \\n 141: 1. Uses LRA qualifiers as the default for newly created regions where region-specific qualifiers are not available.\\n 142: 2. Preserves existing behavior by using realm-based qualifiers for existing regions.\\n 143: \\n 144: It is the responsibility of the dependency services to add the LRACoralConfigHelper to the Config of their client-config package so that their callers receive it through transitive dependency. Caller services only need to ensure they have the latest version of the CoralClientBuilder. Once their callee adds the runtime dependency and builds to live, callers only need to merge from live to pick up the latest changes in their version set.\\n 145: \\n 146: ##### Steps to make your Caller Service LRA compliant\\n 147: \\n 148: ###### 1. CoralClientBuilder Version Update\\n 149: \\n 150: 1. Find your current CoralClientBuilder commit of CoralClientBuilder in your version set: `brazil package print —package CoralClientBuilder —majorVersion {CoralClientBuilder version}`\\n 151:     1. Example: `brazil package print —package CoralClientBuilder —majorVersion 1.1`\\n 152: 1. Determine if update is needed:\\n 153:     1. If your commit date is **AFTER** [aa60006f](https://code.amazon.com/packages/CoralClientBuilder/logs) commit → You already have the required functionality\\n 154:     1. If your commit date is **BEFORE** [aa60006f](https://code.amazon.com/packages/CoralClientBuilder/logs) commit → Follow the instructions in the next step to update your version set\\n 155: 1. To update your version set:\\n 156:     1. Navigate to [pipelines.amazon.com](https://pipelines.amazon.dev/) and select the pipeline for your service \\n 157:     1. Click on the green arrow to the left of the VersionSet\\n 158:        ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/lra_caller_guidance/Pipeline_Versionset_locator.png)\\n 159:     1. Click on Merge Now\\n 160:        ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/lra_caller_guidance/Pipeline_Merge-Now.png)\\n 161:     1. Take the latest commit in CoralClientBuilder, and submit merge request.\\n 162: \\n 163: ###### 2. Sync Live Dependencies\\n 164: Get the latest version set changes of the services you call by merging from live. This will pull in the LRACoralConfigHelper as a transitive dependency into your version set, assuming the service you call has LRACoralConfigHelper as a runtime dependency.\\n 165: (If the service you call is missing this runtime dependency, refer to **section 5** in this lesson.)\\n 166: \\n 167: This ensures you have the Client Builder Instrument capability and the LRA Transformer that enable your service to call the LRA endpoint of your dependencies.\\n 168: \\n 169: **If you use brazil-config in your application**, you have two options:\\n 170: \\n 171: 1. Use LRACoralConfigHelper and ensure you **don’t use a wildcard (*)** in your brazil-config for your **region** selection.\\n 172: 1. Use the brazil-config as the mechanism to select LRA endpoints. See **section 4** in this lesson.\\n 173: \\n 174: \\n 175: ##### The logic behind the LRA Configuration Library (LRACoralConfigHelper)\\n 176: \\n 177: The Configuration Transformer automatically integrates through the CoralClientBuilder service instrument and attempts to identify and use LRA qualifiers when requested qualifiers are unavailable during endpoint selection for client initialization.\\n 178: \\n 179: If the qualifier used by the caller exists in the callee's vended configuration (e.g., existing regions), the endpoint selection and client initialization behavior remains unchanged. However, if the qualifier does not exist (e.g., new regions), the Configuration Transformer steps in, utilizing the LRACoralConfigHelper as a default mechanism to try to replace the non-existent realm-based qualifier with an LRA qualifier.\\n 180: \\n 181: If neither a valid realm-based qualifier nor an LRA qualifier is found, the client initialization will fail with <i>ConfigurationNotFoundException</i>.\\n 182: \\n 183: **Key advantage**: No code changes required - the LRA transformation happens automatically through the service instrument integration once the runtime dependency is added.\\n 184: \\n 185: #### 3- Guidelines for Java Services Calling non-Coral Services\\n 186: \\n 187: If you use brazil-config in your application, navigate to **section 4-1** in this lesson.\\n 188: \\n 189: ##### 3-1. ARest Thick Clients\\n 190: \\n 191: For thick client connections, Callee service manages endpoint selection automatically, unless Caller choose to override the configuration selection. See [this example](https://code.amazon.com/packages/LifecyclePromotionStatusARestServiceClient/blobs/fe25ed98fd4cc84506ce1a711ccc3c17d3b2916a/--/src/main/java/com/amazon/dream/lifecycle/status/client/ClientModule.java#L136) where the Caller only calls getClient() on the callee’s vended config without passing any arguments:\\n 192: \\n 193: ##### 3-2. ARest Thin Clients\\n 194: \\n 195: Thin client Callers must connect to Callees using LRA endpoints in new regions. [A scalable solution for these callers will be available in the coming weeks.]\\n 196: \\n 197: 1. Callers update their usage of endpoints and use the callees LRA endpoints as default for new regions.\\n 198: \\n 199:     1. Go to [ServiceLens]( https://servicelens.jumpstart.amazon.dev/#/services/PricingPriorityDerivationServiceLambda?tabId=endpoints) and search for the your dependency\\n 200:     1. Go to endpoints and filter by LRA\\n 201:     ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/lra_caller_guidance/1.png)\\n 202:     1.

Identify and explicitly define all realm values used by your service. Identifying the possible realm values for your service is out of scope of this guide. The following [example](https://code.amazon.com/packages/AtlasPlatformWebsiteContent/commits/2d1e8b567001a8d399eb6dc592c2b135d6b05c5a) demonstrates this change.\\n 259: \\n 260: ```\\n 261: prod.*.ac2.service.clientconfig = \\\"prod.us-east-1\\\";\\n 262: prod.*.ac2.service.clientconfig = \\\"prod.LRA\\\";\\n 263: prod.EUAmazon.ac2.service.clientconfig = \\\"prod.eu-west-1\\\";\\n 264: prod.DEAmazon.ac2.service.clientconfig = \\\"prod.eu-west-1\\\";\\n 265: prod.GBAmazon.ac2.service.clientconfig = \\\"prod.eu-west-1\\\";\\n 266: prod.FEAmazon.ac2.service.clientconfig = \\\"prod.us-west-2\\\";\\n 267: prod.NAAmazon.ac2.service.clientconfig = \\\"prod.us-east-1\\\";\\n 268: prod.USAmazon.ac2.service.clientconfig = \\\"prod.us-east-1\\\";\\n 269: ```\\n 270: \\n 271: #### 5- Directly add LRACoralConfigHelper\\n 272: \\n 273: As a caller you can add the LRACoralConfigHelper directly in the Config of your client-config package:\\n 274: \\n 275: ##### Change in Config of client-config:\\n 276: ```\\n 277: + runtime-dependencies = {\\n 278: +   1.0 = {\\n 279:         LRACoralConfigHelper = 1.0;\\n 280:     };\\n 281: + };\\n 282: ```\\n 283: #### Testing:\\n 284: \\n 285: * Verify successful deployment in Gamma stage before proceeding to deploying to Prod stage. It’s highly recommended to have integration tests to verify successful connections with your dependencies.\\n 286: \\n 287: #### Troubleshooting: (LRAConfigTransformer)\\n 288: \\n 289: ##### 1- ConfigurationNotFoundException\\n 290: \\n 291: If a **ConfigurationNotFoundException** is thrown during client initialization, it means either:\\n 292: \\n 293: 1. A valid realm-based qualifier was not provided(for existing regions)\\n 294: 2. The LRAConfigHelper was unable to determine a valid LRA qualifier based on your configuration.\\n 295: \\n 296: This issue can occur due to the following reasons:\\n 297: \\n 298: 1. Mismatch between the caller’s domain, and the callee’s vended LRA qualifier’s domain (e.g., gamma vs prod).\\n 299: 2. Incompatible formatting patterns between the caller's qualifier and the callee's vended LRA qualifier. As provided in LRA Onboarding guidelines for callees, **we expect the qualifier that is vended by the callee to have “.lra” in the same segment as the realm/region in their regional qualifiers.**\\n 300: \\n 301: Example for **incompatible** patterns:\\n 302: \\n 303: * Caller's pattern: prod.eu-south-2.ca\\n 304: * Callee's pattern: prod.ca.lra\\n 305: \\n 306: In such cases, the LRA transformer will fail to determine the appropriate LRA qualifier, resulting in failed client initialization.\\n 307: \\n 308: **<ins>Steps to Troubleshoot</ins>**\\n 309: \\n 310: 1. Ensure your domain matches with your callees’ domain\\n 311:     1. Inspect the Client Config Package\\n 312:     1. If your callee only vends prod.lra but you’re trying to use the LRA qualifier in the gamma stage, the initialization will fail since your callee does not vend <i>gamma.lra</i>\\n 313: 2. Ensure that your qualifier formatting pattern is **compatible** with your dependencies formatting pattern:\\n 314:     1. Verify that segmentation order for realm and “.lra” match between your service and your dependencies.\\n 315: \\n 316: Example for **compatible** patterns:\\n 317: \\n 318: * Caller's pattern: prod.eu-south-2.ca\\n 319: * Callee's pattern: prod.lra.ca\\n 320: \\n 321: ### Lesson 1.3: Setup Cross-Region Connectivity\\n 322: \\n 323: > **_GOAL:_** After completing this lesson, your service will have the capability to make cross-region calls to other internal services.\\n 324: \\n 325: Once your endpoints for ZAZ point back to DUB, you need to establish connectivity. At a high level, follow the [ZAZ Connectivity Guide](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/ZAZConnectivity/) to understand how to establish connectivity with your dependencies.\\n 326: \\n 327: The following goes into more detail on the most common approaches; Seamless Connectivity, SuperStar and BigMesh Proxy.\\n 328: \\n 329: #### <ins>Lesson 1.3.1 Onboard to Superstar</ins>\\n 330: \\n 331: **What is SuperStar?**\\n 332: \\n 333: [SuperStar](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/SuperStar/) is a suite of technologies that the Developer Experience (Cxn Foundation) organization is currently building. The SuperStar suite is a multifaceted approach to eliminate all undifferentiated service and client-to-service networking tasks in native AWS. By using the SuperStar suite of technologies teams will be able to decreate developer burden for setup, operations, and security allowing developers to focus on differentiated business logic. SuperStar will automate dependency discovery (by capturing DNS requests), route-binding according to underlying topology, and overarching policy concerns.\\n 334: \\n 335: Onboarding to Superstar enables connectivity for your ZAZ stack so it can communicate to its dependencies in ZAZ, DUB, or Cross Region (IAD/PDX/ETC).\\n 336: \\n 337: **Who should onboard to SuperStar?**\\n 338: \\n 339: Refer to the [ZAZ Connectivity Guide](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/ZAZConnectivity/) to answer this question.\\n 340: \\n 341: **How do I onboard to SuperStar?**\\n 342: \\n 343: To onboard to SuperStar, please follow the [SuperStar Provisioner user guide](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/SuperStar/Provisioner/GettingStarted/).\\n 344: \\n 345: #### <ins>Lesson 1.3.2 Install BigMesh</ins>\\n 346: \\n 347: **What is BigMesh Proxy?**\\n 348: \\n 349: BigMesh Proxy is a sidecar that controls traffic flowing in and out of applications and allow us to provide service mesh functions like cross-region connectivity and load balancing in a transparent manner across all frameworks and languages.\\n 350: \\n 351: As services move to new regions, they will encounter issues in tracking connectivity to their clients and dependencies, along with challenges posed by the long lineage of technologies like Netscalers, Globalized VIPs, Truss, and Bubble Bridge, not all of which will be available in the new regions or under the same management interfaces.  BigMesh is SDO’s mechanism for ensuring services have connectivity to all their dependencies, regardless of migration status, and without becoming blocked on other teams provisioning new cross-region mechanisms for each service as we expand.\\n 352: \\n 353: **Who should install BigMesh Proxy?**\\n 354: \\n 355: All services that are setting up in ZAZ or FRA should install BigMesh Proxy. Installing BigMesh Proxy enables teams to call from ZAZ to their dependencies in DUB without having to create special/unique cross-region connectivity such as BubbleBridge cross-region PrivateLinks.  By providing warm connections for all requests, BigMesh is able to improve cross-region service latency, and has a roadmap of features to improve cross region availability and efficiency.\\n 356: \\n 357: Region Flexibility Engineer will be recommending teams rely on BigMesh to avoid needing to campaign all their customers to update connectivity before migrating traffic. If you do not onboard to BigMesh, you may be required to later by your dependencies, or required to create new connectivity on short timelines to avoid blocking your dependencies migrations. Calls to [DUB Netscalers](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BigMesh/GettingStarted/RegionFlexibility/SupportedUseCases/NetscalerConnectivity) already rely on BigMesh today.\\n 358: \\n 359: **How do I install BigMesh Proxy?**\\n 360: \\n 361: Please follow the instructions [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BigMesh/GettingStarted/OnboardingEgress/) to install BigMesh Proxy.\\n 362: \\n 363: #### <ins>Lesson 1.3.3 Use Seamless Connectivity</ins>\\n 364: \\n 365: **What is Seamless Connectivity?**\\n 366: \\n 367: [Seamless Connectivity](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/SeamlessConnectivity/) provides default connectivity between services and clients based on modeled logical dependencies, regardless of which region or network fabric they operate in. It simplifies how SDO systems connect to their dependencies by transforming our approach from managing individual point-to-point connections to modeling business relationships (service dependencies as modeled by AAA/CloudAuth). Builders can take advantage without doing anything - connectivity was already enabled by default for all native AAA-modeled SDO accounts who did not [explicitly opt-out](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BigMesh/Internal/GlobalEndpoints/SOPs/BigMeshCTSIntegrationCustomerSOPs/#HOpt-outofBigMeshConduitTrustedService28CTS29ConnectivityDefaultEnablement). Seamless Connectivity is of particular importance to the Region Flexibility - Exit DUB program. Connectivity management is a significant source of friction during migrations as it requires coordination between clients and services often not owned by the same team. Seamless Connectivity removes this undifferentiated effort, with savings estimated at 8 SDE days per migration, and 246 person years total for Exit DUB. It also reduces the effort to use region migration accelerators that rely on cross-region connectivity such as the Traffic Shifting Accelerator (TSA) and the Local Region Affinity (LRA) program.\\n 368: \\n 369: **Who should use Seamless Connectivity?**\\n 370: \\n 371: Ideally, all SDO services. However, support will be launched incrementally in phases. Phase 1 launched on 8/7 for existing NAWS AAA services in DUB/ZAZ/FRA, excluding [Ring-0/Ring-1](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/InfoSec/Application_Security/AppSTAR/AppRank/RingModel/Overview/) services (See [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/SeamlessConnectivity/#H5BInProgress5DSeamlessConnectivityDefaultEnablementPhases) for additional details).\\n 372: \\n 373: **How do I know if my service is onboarded to Seamless Connectivity?**\\n 374: \\n 375: You can check if your NAWS clients/callers are ready for multi-region connectivity using the [Seamless Connectivity Checker](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Shell_Divers/ConnectityReadinessTool/Mechanic/UserGuide) CLI tool. For use-cases outside of NAWS clients, see [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BigMesh/Internal/GlobalEndpoints/SOPs/CommonCustomerInquires/#HHowcanIconfirmClientonboarding) for **onboarding checks** you can run outside of the CLI tool.\\n 376: \\n 377: **How do I onboard to Seamless Connectivity?**\\n 378: \\n 379: You should be able to take advantage without doing anything - connectivity was already enabled by default for all native AAA-modeled SDO accounts who did not [explicitly opt-out](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BigMesh/Internal/GlobalEndpoints/SOPs/CommonCustomerInquires/#HHowcanIconfirmClientonboarding). But, if you need to manually onboard (for example, if you are a new service that wasn’t part of our bulk enablement), see [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BigMesh/GettingStarted/OnboardingEgress/) for **manual onboarding steps**.\\n 380: \\n 381: #### <ins>Lesson 1.3.4 FAQs</ins>\\n 382: \\n 383: **Why does the Seamless Connectivity Checker only target NAWS clients?**\\n 384: \\n 385: We specifically targeted NAWS services in its initial release because the Exit-DUB MAWS regions (DUB/ZAZ/FRA) are already inter-connected via L3 peering.\\n 386: \\n 387: *For more FAQs regarding Seamless Connectivity, please see [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/SeamlessConnectivity/#HFrequentlyAskedQuestions)*\\n 388: \\n 389: **Where can I learn more about BigMesh?**\\n 390: \\n 391: Please go to the BigMesh wiki wiki to learn more.\\n 392: \\n 393: \\n 394: **Are there any compatibility requirements for my application?**\\n 395: \\n 396: Standard amazon http and https services using AAA or CloudAuth are compatible.

The domain is generally indicating something like alpha/beta/gamma/prod. Realm is unfortunately ill-defined, and can represent a single country or marketplace, a collection of countries or marketplaces, and/or the region the service is running in. It is recommended to check with the team for the correct usage. Across Stores, the most common realm values are USAmazon, EUAmazon, and JPAmazon/FEAmazon, with EUAmazon most frequently meaning \\\"the configuration for the marketplaces running in DUB\\\". Domain and realm are typically initialized as part of service start up, most commonly by defining them in the PubSub op config in Apollo:\\n 597: \\n 598: ![1714678493323-248.png](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/refactor_configuration/1714678493323-248.png)  \\n 599: For more detail about Operational Configuration, please refer to the following wiki,  \\n 600: https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/apollo/user-guide/concepts-operational-configuration/\\n 601: \\n 602: Realm is then used throughout the application as a key into brazil-config, determining the startup behavior of the application. While it is generally not the \\\"correct\\\" key, it's the key folks know how to use, and many choose to use it as the configuration key even when it doesn't accurately reflect the dimension that the configuration should be keyed off. For example, many teams use realms like EUAmazon as a synonym for \\\"where is the code running\\\", where the AWS region is the correct key, as well as \\\"what configuration should be applied in this business context\\\", where the key should be the business context.\\n 603: \\n 604: **Business configuration**  \\n 605: Business configuration represents values that your application needs at runtime in order to customize its logic according to a given context. It is the configuration tied to _what logic executes_. Example business configuration includes things like \\\"this feature is enabled in these countries\\\" or \\\"we accept these forms of payment in this marketplace\\\". A few examples:\\n 606: \\n 607: ```\\n 608: *.USAmazon.ATVPDKIKX0DER.locale = \\\"en_US\\\"\\n 609: \\n 610: *.EUAmazon.DE.preferredCurrency=\\\"EUR\\\"\\n 611: ```\\n 612: \\n 613: **Technical configuration**  \\n 614: Technical configuration is the configuration tied to _where your code runs_. Some of this configuration is referred to as \\\"settings\\\" and defines application startup parameters. These are typically things like Odin material set names, DynamoDB tables, SQS arns, and endpoints for dependencies. A few examples:\\n 615: \\n 616: ```\\n 617: # Odin Material Set\\n 618: prod.EUAmazon.ZeroesCommonsMonitoring.materialSet = \\\"com.amazon.access.SwordViewConfig-Prod-s3-full-access-monitor-eu-1\\\";\\n 619: \\n 620: # SQS ARN\\n 621: prod.us-east-1.Dacia.sqs.arn = \\\"arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:723354600757:DaciaQueue\\\";\\n 622: \\n 623: # Dependency URL\\n 624: *.EUAmazon.MWS.url = “https://mws-eu.amazonservices.com/”\\n 625: ```\\n 626: \\n 627: \\n 628: ### Lesson 3.4: Refactor configuration\\n 629: \\n 630: > **_GOAL:_** The goal of this lesson is to refactor business and technical configuration to be region flexible.\\n 631: \\n 632: Before you migrate, you need to ensure your service's configuration is region flexible. While it may seem easier in the near-term to simply copy/paste/modify your configuration, this introduces significant risk to your migration and your customers - we've already seen teams forget to update config for the new regions and spend a lot of time debugging the problem.\\n 633: \\n 634: To make your configuration region flexible, you should:\\n 635: 1. Refactor your business configuration to leverage \\\"natural parameters\\\" as the key instead of realm - i.e., the actual underlying key that the configuration is coupled to. E.g., replacing keys like `prod.USAmazon.ATVPDKIKX0DER.myKey` with `prod.*.ATVPDKIKX0DER.key` enables you to launch in new regions without having to touch your business configuration.\\n 636: 2. Name your technical configuration by convention going forward to minimize the configuration you need. E.g., consistently naming Odin material sets with region as a placeholder, like `\\\"prod.*.registry.materialSet = HorizontePlatform.GenericGiftRegistry.WeddingRegistry.wedding-hz-$REALM$\\\"` makes it so that you don't have to update this configuration value for any new regions so long as you continue to leverage the AWS region as the realm in new regions.\\n 637: \\n 638: To assist with this process, we provide workflows in [Ironhide](https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/ironhide/), a universal code transformation toolkit. Ironhide offers a set of transformations specifically designed to help refactor configurations and make them region-flexible. These transformations address critical region inflexibilities such as hardcoded region names, region-specific API endpoints, and data-center location assumptions that currently hinder service migration from mega-regions like DUB to new regions such as ZAZ and FRA. While Ironhide can significantly streamline the refactoring process, it's important to note that it may not cover all scenarios. Therefore, it's crucial to:\\n 639: \\n 640: - Use Ironhide's transformations as a starting point for your refactoring efforts\\n 641: - Review the changes made by Ironhide and ensure they align with your service's specific needs\\n 642: - Continue to follow the principles outlined in the rest of this lesson for any configurations not covered by Ironhide's transformations\\n 643: \\n 644: #### <ins>Lesson 3.4.1: Refactor Configuration with Ironhide</ins>\\n 645: \\n 646: [Ironhide](https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/ironhide/) is a universal code transformation toolkit. We have created a set of transformations to help refactor configurations and make them region flexible.\\n 647: \\n 648: These transformations address and reduce critical region inflexibilities — such as hardcoded region names, region-specific API endpoints, and data center location assumptions — that currently hinder service migration from mega-regions like DUB to new regions such as ZAZ and FRA. These automated workflows also help reduce configuration sprawl and standardization challenges by consolidating duplicate configurations across domains/realms, streamlining ARN resource management.\\n 649: \\n 650: By leveraging Ironhide's powerful automation and testing capabilities, these transformations improve deployment flexibility, reduce maintenance overhead, and future-proof services for regional expansion. They ensure reliability through built-in validation features. All transformations were pre-tested and reviewed by domain experts before being made available.\\n 651: \\n 652: ##### Installation:\\n 653: \\n 654: Ensure you're on a cloud desktop, and run\\n 655: \\n 656: ```sh\\n 657: toolbox install ironhide\\n 658: ```\\n 659: \\n 660: ##### Usage:\\n 661: Ironhide can be invoked if you provide either a version set and package(s), or the absolute path to an existing workspace. Use the `-mn RegionFlex_ConfigInflexFix` arguments to run the workflows.\\n 662: \\n 663: ```sh\\n 664: # provide version set and package\\n 665: ironhide -mn RegionFlex_ConfigInflexFix \\\\\\n 666:   -vs <version_set> -p <package>\\n 667: ```\\n 668: \\n 669: or:\\n 670: \\n 671: ```sh\\n 672: # provide existing workspace\\n 673: ironhide -mn RegionFlex_ConfigInflexFix \\\\\\n 674:   --existing-workspace <absolute-path-to-workspace>\\n 675: ```\\n 676: \\n 677: **Note**\\n 678: * **Throttling Issues with Claude 3.7 Workflows**: All new workflows are now using the _Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.7 model_ by default.

Be careful when building out maps or using the += operator to ensure you see the expected results (more details [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BrazilConfigSyntax/#.27Operator_.2B.3D.27)).\\n1078: \\n1079: If you want to start using [Amazon Config Store](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/INTech/AmazonConfigStore/) (ACS) as you refactor your business configuration, check out the joint ACS and Region Flexibility training on [Making Your Configuration Region Flexible](https://learn.a2z.com/app/course/amzn1.c3.v2.c38d8fa6-3fb2-4f02-b9a0-ea407237bf84/).\\n1080: \\n1081: #### <ins>Lesson 3.4.3: Refactor technical configuration to be region flexible</ins>\\n1082: \\n1083: To align technical configuration with its \\\"correct\\\" keys, you should leverage the full AWS region as the realm in new regions (e.g., eu-south-2 for Spain/ZAZ). Find more details on why in our [realm recommendation wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Deep_Dives_and_Announcements/Deep_Dives/Realm_Recommendation/). And wherever possible, you'll want to name technical configuration by convention to minimize the amount of configuration required.\\n1084: \\n1085: Looking at the technical configuration examples from the prior lesson, here's what they may look like when made region flexible:\\n1086: \\n1087: ```\\n1088: prod.EUAmazon.ZeroesCommonsMonitoring.materialSet = \\\"com.amazon.access.SwordViewConfig-Prod-s3-full-access-monitor-eu-1\\\";\\n1089: \\n1090: incorporates eu-south-2 with\\n1091: \\n1092: prod.*.ZeroesCommonsMonitoring.materialSet = \\\"com.amazon.access.SwordViewConfig-Devo-s3-full-access-monitor-$REALM$\\\";\\n1093: ```\\n1094: \\n1095: ```\\n1096: prod.us-east-1.Dacia.sqs.arn = \\\"arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:723354600757:DaciaQueue\\\";\\n1097: \\n1098: incorporates eu-south-2 with\\n1099: \\n1100: # Note: This assumes the same AWS account is used across regions.\\n1101: prod.eu-south-2.Dacia.sqs.arn = \\\"arn:aws:sqs:eu-south-2:723354600757:DaciaQueue\\\";\\n1102: ```\\n1103: \\n1104: ```\\n1105: *.EUAmazon.MWS.url = “https://mws-eu.amazonservices.com/”\\n1106: \\n1107: incorporates eu-south-2 with\\n1108: \\n1109: # TODO: Once MWS is available in eu-south-2, update this URL.\\n1110: *.eu-south-2.MWS.url = “https://mws-eu.amazonservices.com/”\\n1111: ```\\n1112: \\n1113: At this time, RFE does not recommend changing realms in existing regions this way, as it is not a requirement for exiting DUB and time is a priority. If you choose to make this change, we  have a few recommendations for reducing the risk:\\n1114: 1. Make this change one region at a time.\\n1115: 2. Don't let the change linger, to reduce the likelihood of new configuration being introduced that your team members miss applying to both the new and legacy realms.\\n1116: 3. Use some of the commands outlined in this lesson to identify configuration tied to the legacy realm that is provided by other teams' libraries, which will require special handling.\\n1117: \\n1118: #### <ins>Lesson 3.4.4: Validate wildcard client configuration</ins>\\n1119: \\n1120: While wildcards (i.e., `*.*.<key>`) are desirable in business configuration, they can present a risk in technical configuration if the configuration value is not properly parameterized. Where wildcards are used in endpoint selection, for example, deployments will be successful, but services in new regions will then direct to an unintended endpoint, causing traffic to go to the wrong domain/stage or region (e.g., IAD gamma instead of ZAZ prod) or fail due to missing connectivity to that incorrect domain/stage and region. Make sure to review the qualifiers you pull in (e.g., using the commands earlier in this module) to ensure traffic will be routed to the right place.\\n1121: \\n1122: Example: A team set their realm to eu-south-2, and got to the point where their service successfully started up, which they thought meant all their dependencies were either ready in eu-south-2 or had configuration pointing back to DUB. But when they got confusing errors, they ultimately found this configuration:\\n1123: \\n1124: ```\\n1125: *.*.BSFSRHttpConnectionInfo.LocalizationMetadataServiceBSF = {\\n1126:     path = \\\"/\\\";\\n1127:     server = \\\"lms-bsf-na-master.amazon.com\\\";\\n1128:     port = 7777;\\n1129: };\\n1130: ```\\n1131: \\n1132: To fix it, the team had to add new configuration values for this key for eu-south-2.\\n1133: \\n1134: \\n1135: #### <ins>Lesson 3.4.5: Validate your configuration changes</ins>\\n1136: \\n1137: {{info}}\\n1138:  **Make sure to validate!**  \\n1139: It is critical to validate your configuration changes. Different brazil-config parsers function differently, as highlighted in the [general brazil-config guidance](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BrazilConfigFAQ#How_do_wildcards_in_keys_work.3F) - e.g., the Java and the Python parsers may interpret wildcards-based paths differently. Compare your existing EUAmazon config output looks consistent by leveraging some of the commands provided below.\\n1140: {{/info}}\\n1141: \\n1142: To help you understand what config values need to be updated, the following command can be used to find all brazil-config files containing EUAmazon that your service pulls in. You can substitute your DUB realm in for EUAmazon to make this work for your service if you use a different realm. After performing the refactor, you can run the command with the new realm (eu-south-2 for ZAZ) to compare results. Note: this outputs the configuration that will be deployed in the Apollo environment at runtime, not considering any overrides you set in the Apollo environment itself. It may reflect configuration that is unused, and will not reflect any configuration only used for testing.\\n1143: \\n1144: ```\\n1145: find `brazil-path run.configfarm.brazil-config` -not -type d | \\\\\\n1146:   xargs -I{} -i grep -l -i euamazon {}  | \\\\\\n1147:   xargs -I{} readlink -f {}\\n1148: ```\\n1149: \\n1150: Once you know what config files are relevant, you can either look at them individually, or modify the above command to get the exact entries with the realm in them:\\n1151: ```\\n1152: find `brazil-path run.configfarm.brazil-config` -not -type d | \\\\\\n1153:   xargs -I{} -i grep -i euamazon {}\\n1154: ```\\n1155: \\n1156: To get the full picture of what configuration is loaded in for a particular domain and realm, you can leverage a command like the following after replacing the `<>` with the appropriate variables. The output will include `*.*` and `domain.*` configuration that isn't shown with the other commands. There are [other fields](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BrazilConfigDumper/#ConfigDumper_in_AmazonAppConfigJava) like `appgroup` and `override` that you should include if they're used in your service startup. In newer Coral services, this startup information can be found in your service's `<servicename>.java` file ([example file](https://code.amazon.com/packages/CoralFargateServiceSDO/blobs/4c26208e07afd45091539a608216c749248e4ffa/--/src/main/java/com/amazon/%7B%7Blowercase%20ServiceName%7D%7D/%7B%7BServiceName%7D%7D.java#L66), [args](https://code.amazon.com/packages/CoralFargateServiceSDO/blobs/54bed08a2d4a33aca4cc3218437cabe46970f2fd/--/build.gradle.kts#L176-L178)). Note: you may need to run `brazil-build` first to get the full output from the command.\\n1157: ```\\n1158: brazil-runtime-exec \\\"$(brazil-path '[JDK<version>]pkg.jdk')/bin/java\\\" \\\\\\n1159:   -cp `perl -e 'print join(q{:},@ARGV)' $(brazil-bootstrap)/lib/*.jar` \\\\\\n1160:   amazon.platform.config.ConfigDumper \\\\\\n1161:   --root $(brazil-bootstrap) \\\\\\n1162:   --domain \\\"<domain>\\\" \\\\\\n1163:   --realm \\\"<realm>\\\" \\\\\\n1164:   --app \\\"<service name in Config file>\\\"\\n1165: ```\\n1166: \\n1167: Here's an example of how to run it:\\n1168: ```\\n1169: brazil-runtime-exec \\\"$(brazil-path '[JDK17]pkg.jdk')/bin/java\\\" \\\\\\n1170:   -cp `perl -e 'print join(q{:},@ARGV)' $(brazil-bootstrap)/lib/*.jar` \\\\\\n1171:   amazon.platform.config.ConfigDumper \\\\\\n1172:   --root $(brazil-bootstrap) \\\\\\n1173:   --domain \\\"beta\\\" \\\\\\n1174:   --realm \\\"us-west-2\\\" \\\\\\n1175:   --app \\\"RegionFlexMigrationManagementLambda\\\"\\n1176: ```\\n1177: \\n1178: \\n1179: \\n1180: ### Lesson 3.5: Order Hardware\\n1181: \\n1182: As ordering hardware is a time-consuming process, we recommend ordering the necessary hardware upfront to ensure it is ready before you start the Clone your infrastructure stack(s) module.\\n1183: \\n1184: If you are on MAWS and plan on using Replicator, Replicator will copy your Apollo environments and order a single host per ASG.

The absence of updated IP ranges in the policy creates blockers for services like Timber, Odin, S3 and DynamoDB. While temporary workarounds, like removing users from the DragonIPAllowlisting group, have resolved immediate issues, this is not a scalable solution.\\n1204: Proactive updating of IP allowlisting policies for new regions and establishing a monitoring process for dependencies can prevent such disruptions.\\n1205: \\n1206: #### Guide to Handle DragonIPAllowlistingPolicy Issues\\n1207: \\n1208: 1. **Identifying the Issue**\\n1209: \\n1210:     1. **Error Symptoms**: AccessDeniedException errors in logs or cloud trails for IAM users performing actions in the ZAZ region.\\n1211:     1. **Common Errors**:\\n1212:         1. Explicit Deny in identity-based policy.\\n1213:         1. CloudTrail events showing unrecognized sourceIP.\\n1214:     1. **Example Logs**:\\n1215: \\n1216:         ```\\n1217:         User: arn:aws:iam::651706746811:user/IsaFanout is not authorized to perform: dynamodb:CreateTable\\n1218:         ```\\n1219: \\n1220:         ```\\n1221:         failed: Timber returned an error: Error Code: AccessDenied, Error Message: You are not authorized to perform this operation, HTTP code: 403\\n1222:         ```\\n1223: 1. **Solution**\\n1224: \\n1225:     1. **Step 1**: Remove the impacted IAM user from the DragonIPAllowlisting IAM permission group.\\n1226:         1. Go the AWS IAM console \\n1227:         1. Click on User Groups under Access Management \\n1228:         1. Click on the DragonIPAllowlisting IAM user group \\n1229:         1. Under the \\\"Users in this group\\\", select the IAM users and click on \\\"Remove Users\\\" \\n1230: \\n1231:     1. **Step 2**: Verify if removing the user mitigates the error. This is a short-term solution to unblock the resource access.\\n1232: \\n1233: **Why removal is safe?**\\n1234: \\n1235: Removing this policy will NOT break production applications.

While upgrading the `@amzn/pipeline` package to its latest version offers a solution, this upgrade necessitates a comprehensive migration to **CDKv2** since newer versions of `@amzn/pipeline` are predominantly CDKv2-compatible. This technical debt highlights the importance of maintaining updated CDK versions and dependencies, as it directly impacts the service's ability to expand smoothly across AWS regions. As a prerequisite to regional expansions, service team should prioritise CDKv2 migration to prevent deployment failures. (example: [Ticket](https://t.corp.amazon.com/D208974370/communication) with AWS team regarding deployment failure).\\n1247: \\n1248: You will see the following example error if your pipeline is in CDKv1 and is deploying to new region like ZAZ:\\n1249: \\n1250: **Sample Error:**\\n1251: \\n1252: > Failed to create CloudFormation target arn:aws:cloudformation:eu-south-2:840864613710:stack/CloudAuthStack-gamma-ZAZ: no KMS key present for bucket deploymentbucket-4764c841f7cff9887e497174ea1ee807d319b483 in region eu-south-2\\n1253: \\n1254: <pre>\\n1255: This AMZN::ContinuousDeployment::Pipeline resource is in a UPDATE_FAILED state.\\n1256: Caused by: Com::amazon::Buildertools::Cdservice::InvalidParameterException:\\n1257: The EditPipelineAsync operation failed: Status: FAILED\\n1258: Error Type: com.amazon.buildertools.cdservice.InvalidParameterException\\n1259: Additional Details: Workflow [workflow id: 3251990, run id: 236fhGUy0J46jZ4CIxU2LsFwZcjkyGsKTG0somw7DPO/8=] failed.\\n1260: Reason: com.amazon.buildertools.cdservice.InvalidParameterException: Couldn't add sub-target to Deployment Group\\n1261: target us-west-2:3251990:SEACXCdk-gamma-ZAZ: Invalid parameter when creating CDCloudFormationService target\\n1262: with the error message: '<b>Failed to create CloudFormation target arn:aws:cloudformation:eu-south-2:840864613710:stack/CloudAuthStack-gamma-ZAZ:\\n1263: no KMS key present for bucket deploymentbucket-4764c841f7cff9887e497174ea1ee807d319b483 in region eu-south-2</b>',\\n1264: metadata 'CloudFormationTargetDescription(super=TargetMetadata()...\\n1265: </pre>\\n1266: \\n1267: To fix Missing KMS key for deployment bucket issue, you need to upgrade `@amzn/pipelines`.

As we uncover and establish guidance for other areas of risk, they will be added to this milestone.\\n1306: \\n1307: \\n1308: \\n1309: ## Module 4: Data Recipe Identification\\n1310: \\n1311: > **_GOAL:_** For this module, we will help you identify the cross-region data accessibility recipe that best fits your use case for each dataset you own, or identify risks where no pre-defined recipes align with your use cases.\\n1312: \\n1313: *Note:  Based on the number of impacted datasets, we prioritized creating recipes for Sable, DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.  We will add recipes for SQS, SNS, OpenSearch, and ElasticSearch by the end of 2024. If you need to identify your data strategy ahead of that timeline or you need support for different data stores, reach out to us at [#region-flex-data-migrations](https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C06QBBQALSD).*\\n1314: \\n1315: Data has historically been co-located in-region with the services that use it, which provided fast and reliable access. As we migrate to new regions, we will need to leverage new data access patterns as we migrate, replicate, and cache our data across regions. By the end of this module, you will identify your data stores, pick a data accessibility strategy, and either identify the right recipe or let us know if you can't find a recipe for your use case so that we can assist.\\n1316: \\n1317: As you navigate your recipe selection, consider the following:\\n1318: 1. Do you need this data? Deleting data is easier than moving it or accessing it cross-region.\\n1319: 1. How frequently do you use this data? Infrequently accessed data may be easier to migrate independently of associated services, simplifying your migration.\\n1320: 1. Can you easily recreate this data? If so, instead of a migration, you can build up your data in the destination region and then clean it up in the source region.\\n1321: 1. How much down-time can your application tolerate?  If you can tolerate downtime, your migration will take less effort and less calendar time.\\n1322: 1. How much added latency can your application tolerate? If you can tolerate latency, you can start by calling back to data sets instead of migrating or replicating them across regions. But keep in mind that you will ultimately need to move the data to the destination region.\\n1323: 1. Does your application require access to strongly consistent data? Migrating strongly consistent data requires significantly more effort than migrating eventually consistent data (e.g., weeks vs days).  Don’t rely simply on the API calls your application makes (e.g., ConsistentRead parameter set to “True” for DynamoDB’s GetItem API calls); make every attempt to see if your application can tolerate eventually consistent data access to simplify your migration.\\n1324: \\n1325: At a high level, you will follow one of these strategies:\\n1326: * **Keep data in the source region**: You can use this approach 1) if your service can tolerate the cross-region WAN latency, 2) for data at rest, and 3) for infrequently-used data. We discourage this approach for frequently-used data and for this use case, we ask teams to use it only for temporary experimentation or if a tool is not available to migrate/replicate your data store.\\n1327: * **Replicate your data**: Replicating data makes sense when you have eventually consistent data access and you run your service stacks in both the source and destination regions. Homepage is an example of a sub-experience that will replicate data because each marketplace typically uses the datasets and the same services and only some marketplaces are migrating in 2025. A big consideration to data replication is the traffic on the WAN, which will be aligned with your current write traffic on that data store.\\n1328: * **Recreate your data in the destination region**: When you use this approach, you will not initially migrate or replicate any data from the source region but will instead re-create it in the destination region over time. This approach is suitable if you have infrequently used data with a retention policy. This approach will require an update to your service to obtain historic data from the source region; however, this approach differs from the “Create a data cache in the destination region” approach (below) because you will not write this data to the destination region.\\n1329: * **Create a data cache in the destination region**: We currently don’t have tooling that can fully support this approach so service changes will likely be required. For this approach, you will replicate only new writes to your source datastore (which is supported by our current tooling). However, to access existing data, you would obtain it from the source region and then write it to the destination region for future use (requiring service changes). This approach is suitable if your historic dataset is not frequently used.\\n1330: * **Migrate your data**: You will typically use this approach for strongly consistent data sets, when you are certain that the data is not required in the source region, or when you can tolerate the cross-region latency from the source region to the destination data store. As you migrate your data, you will need to switch all traffic associated with this data store to the new region. This is typically the most complex data movement approach, but it mitigates your exposure to WAN link degradations.\\n1331: \\n1332: You know your data best, but we recognize these are new questions most teams haven’t had to work through before. If you have any questions or need any guidance, please contact us on Slack at [#region-flex-data-migrations](https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C06QBBQALSD).\\n1333: \\n1334: ### Lesson 4.1: Identify Your Data Stores\\n1335: \\n1336: > **_GOAL:_** After completing this lesson, you should have identified the data stores in scope for your migration.\\n1337: \\n1338: First, you need to identify the data stores you depend on. This includes the data stores owned or managed by your service, as well as any data stores owned by others that you access or are triggered by.\\n1339: \\n1340: If you're reading this page from the [Region Flex Portal](https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/), you have the ability to include data stores that should be a part of your migration plan.  On the RFP main page, you can create a brand new migration plan, or select an existing plan to edit.  As you progress through the wizard, you will have the opportunity to add datasets associated to the service you're migrating.\\n1341: \\n1342: Alternatively, you can start with [Managed Migration Experience (M2X) Discovery](https://console.m2x.amazon.dev/) for Sable, DynamoDB, S3, RDS, and SQS data stores. The default view will provide the data stores that you have access to through your bindles; however, you can navigate your organization by inserting someone else’s alias in the “View as” textbox in the upper righthand side. For other data stores, you will need to manually review all the resources owned by the AWS account numbers that are either owned by or have permissions to your pipelines.\\n1343: \\n1344: A good starting point to find your AWS account numbers is from [https://pipelines.amazon.com/pipelines/<your-pipeline-name>](https://pipelines.amazon.com/pipelines/your-pipeline-name) to see which account numbers your pipelines use for deployment. You can also download your [IMR monthly statements](https://cerberus.cloudtune.amazon.dev/usage) for your fleet;  your statement will list the datastores you are using along with the AWS account numbers.\\n1345: \\n1346: \\n1347: ### Lesson 4.2: Identify Your Recipes\\n1348: \\n1349: > **_GOAL:_** After completing this lesson, you should have identified the recipe associated with each of your data stores\\n1350: \\n1351: Now that you've identified your data stores, it's time to figure out what recipes they map to. We have recipes available for [Sable, DynamoDB, S3, RDS, SQS, SNS, OpenSearch, and ElasticSearch](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/DataMovementRecipes/). For Sable, Dynamo, and S3, [Region Flex Portal](https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/) has integrated with the M2X Accelerator for a semi-automated guided migration experience.\\n1352: \\n1353: If you don't find a recipe that meets your use case, this presents a risk to your migration.  Please reach out to us on Slack at [#region-flex-data-migrations](https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C06QBBQALSD).\\n1354: \\n1355: # Migration Milestone 1: Set up your infrastructure\\n1356: \\n1357: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this milestone: Your service is set up and verified to be minimally operational.\\n1358: \\n1359: \\n1360: \\n1361: ## Module 5: Prepare your AWS accounts\\n1362: \\n1363: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this module, your AWS account will be setup for the new region.\\n1364: \\n1365: In this module, we will cover how to set up your AWS account with hardware, permissions, and appropriate quotas to support your code\\n1366: \\n1367: ### Lesson 5.1: Creating New AWS Accounts\\n1368: \\n1369: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this lesson, you will have your new AWS account(s) ready for the new region, if necessary.\\n1370: \\n1371: #### <ins>Lesson 5.1.1 Determining your account granularity</ins>\\n1372: \\n1373: 1. DynamoDB Global Tables does not support cross-account replication of data. As a result, services which use Global Tables for data replication will do so within a single account, and both the primary (DUB) and replicated (ZAZ) tables will be in the same account.\\n1374: 2. For tier 1 services, it is best practice to have a per-aws-region account strategy (where technically viable). DynamoDB Global Tables is a situation where a single AWS account for both primary (DUB) and replicated (ZAZ) tables, as a per-aws-region account strategy is not technically viable; therefore, teams will create replicas in multiple regions using the same account.\\n1375: 3. With all AWS regions contained within the European Union (including DUB, ZAZ, and FRA), this is an acceptable structure to support the migration of data.\\n1376: 4. This only affects account structure and does not affect the overall need to review migration of data with legal if there are concerns with whether moving the data is acceptable.\\n1377: 5. For services which use Global Tables in a single account, the services have two options for other regional infrastructure:\\n1378:     1. The preferred option is to build other infrastructure (compute, etc) in a separate account, with cross-account access used to access DyanamoDB.\\n1379:     2. If the first option is not feasible for some reason, teams can build other infrastructure supporting the second region in the same account.  Please weigh the risks of this approach such as operator safety and account limit sharing between multiple regional stacks.\\n1380: 6. For smaller migrations, especially migrations from DUB to only one region, it is a viable strategy for services migrating to ZAZ to use Global Tables to move data, build the ZAZ infrastructure in the same account, shut down the DUB infrastructure, change the DDB Global Table primary table, and effectively convert the same account from single-region-DUB to single-region-ZAZ.\\n1381: 7. In the case of some managed compute technologies, new compute may be automatically placed in new accounts. For example, [HEX-AWS](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/HEX/HEX-AWS/HEX-AWS-Path-Forward/) does not support same account for AWS resources. In these cases, this will restrict services which also use Global Tables to option 5(a) above.\\n1382: 8. DynamoDB is expected to launch Cross-Account Global Tables in Q3-2025, at which point, this issue will be resolved going forward. Please note that it is possible that Security and CRRE, at some future date, may instruct teams to maintain separate accounts.\\n1383: \\n1384: #### <ins>Lesson 5.1.2 Creating the account</ins>\\n1385: \\n1386: If you do decide you need a new account, there are two ways RFE recommends doing it:\\n1387: \\n1388: ***With Replicator:***\\n1389: \\n1390: For services utilizing _Replicator_, you will have the option to create new AWS accounts when generating new Tardigrade endpoints. You may re-use these new accounts to put the rest of your stage-specific AWS resources.\\n1391: \\n1392: ***Without Replicator:***\\n1393: * Go to the [Conduit Website](https://conduit.security.a2z.com/).\\n1394: * Open the left Navigation Menu, and select \\\"Create New Account\\\" menu item.\\n1395: * Follow the Wizard steps to create the new account.\\n1396: \\n1397: \\n1398: ### Lesson 5.2: AWS Limitations and Requests\\n1399: \\n1400: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this lesson, your AWS limits/quotas in the destination region will match those in the source region.\\n1401: \\n1402: \\n1403: {{warning}}\\n1404:  If you are utilizing Replicator, then Replicator will have prompted you to sync the AWS Service Quotas already. If not using Replicator or need to sync another AWS account, then follow the instructions below.\\n1405: {{/warning}}\\n1406: \\n1407: Some teams need to override limits/service quotas for various AWS services. As you start to leverage a new region and potentially a new account, you want to make sure that account has equivalent limits/quotas set compared to the source region to avoid running into issues at scale that are difficult to find in testing.\\n1408: \\n1409: ### Service Quota Syncer\\n1410: AWS Service Quotas Syncer ([demo here](https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/1358675)) is an RFE tool that is available via CLI for all service types. It is strongly recommended to utilize this automation to reduce effort.\\n1411: \\n1412: ##### <ins> Step 1: Give Service Quotas Sync CLI the necessary permissions in source and target accounts</ins>\\n1413: \\n1414: In order to execute Service Quotas Sync CLI,  please follow the instructions provided on the [Service Quotas Syncer Permissions](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Factorio/Replicator/FAQ/#HServiceQuotasSyncerPermissions).\\n1415: \\n1416: #### <ins> Step 2: Get the Quota Sync tool from gitfarm\\n1417: First, you will need to pull the package. From your DevDesktop:\\n1418: \\n1419:         brazil workspace create --name FactorioResourceReplicatorCLI && cd FactorioResourceReplicatorCLI\\n1420:         brazil workspace use --package FactorioResourceReplicatorCLI -vs FactorioResourceReplicator/development\\n1421:         brazil-build clean && brazil-build\\n1422: Then, you will need to export the stage:\\n1423: \\n1424:         export STAGE=prod\\n1425: \\n1426: Then, run the CLI command to compare and begin syncing quotas between the source AWS account and region to the target AWS account and region. It will return a `request-id` that you should save for later progress tracking.\\n1427: \\n1428:         brazil-runtime-exec replicator servicequotas compare -sr <SOURCE-REGION> -sa <SOURCE-ACCOUNT> -tr <TARGET-REGION> -ta <TARGET-ACCOUNT>\\n1429: \\n1430: An hourly scheduled lambda will pick this and start processing by raising quota increase requests\\n1431: The latest status of the requests can be found as follows:\\n1432: \\n1433:         brazil-runtime-exec replicator servicequotas status -id <request-id>\\n1434: \\n1435: #### <ins> Step 3: Follow up for AWS manually-reviewed requests\\n1436: Not all quota requests will be automatically approved. You may receive email notifications to the AWS account email's address with requests for additional information from AWS customer support regarding your quota request. Navigate into the AWS console and reply back to the case so that customer service can continue to process your request. Once the case is closed the Service Quota Syncer will automatically run again to process additional quota requests.\\n1437: \\n1438: ### Manually\\n1439: \\n1440: #### View your AWS Service limits/quotas\\n1441: \\n1442: To view the quotas provided by default, choose one of the following options:\\n1443: \\n1444: * Open the [Service endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-service-information.html) page in the documentation, search for the service name, and click the link to go to the page for that service. To view the service quotas for all AWS services in the documentation without switching pages, view the information in [PDF form](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/general/latest/gr/aws-general.pdf) instead.\\n1445: * Open the [Service Quotas Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home), In the navigation pane, choose **AWS services** and select a service.\\n1446: * Alternative: Use the [list-service-quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/service-quotas/list-service-quotas.html) and [list-aws-default-service-quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/service-quotas/list-aws-default-service-quotas.html) AWS CLI commands.\\n1447: \\n1448: ### Additional Resources\\n1449: \\n1450: **Need help**, contact [AWS Plus Technical Account Managers(TAMs)](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Plus/tams/).\\n1451: For detailed information about increasing the AWS service limits, see:\\n1452: \\n1453: 1.

Replicator’s north star is to reduce your engineering effort of infrastructure cloning down to a couple days.\\n1464: \\n1465: The best way to use Replicator is to use the [Region Flex Portal](https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/) to manage your entire migration. The portal will not only manage your stack replication tasks, but also walk you through the rest of the service migration. \\n1466: \\n1467: Replicator will require some permissions to perform the discovery and creation. [See Replicator’s FAQ on AWS account permissions for Tardigrade](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Factorio/Replicator/FAQ#HWhatIAMpermissionsdoIneedtoprovidetoReplicator3F).

Several teams, including InfoSec, create and depend on these attributes to meet security, compliance, and availability requirements. Missing or incorrect attributes can lead to critical issues for your service in new regions. Ensure all newly created AWS accounts are properly tagged by following [this runbook](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Icon/rfm/runbooks/AWSAccountAttributesReplication).\\n1489: \\n1490: In the future, Replicator will:\\n1491: \\n1492: * Update configurations (BrazilConfig, JLBRelay, etc...)\\n1493: * Add your new apollo environment to your existing pipeline\\n1494: \\n1495: **Replicator for NAWS pipelines**\\n1496: \\n1497: Replicator will scan your non-Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) AWS account and generate a CDK leveraging Alkimia. If you are using LPT to manage your pipeline(s) and would like to move to CDK, you can use Replicator.

Please use [Replicator](https://prod.replicator.tools.amazon.dev/) directly, select \\\"No pipeline (AWS Account)\\\" on the pipeline selection page to begin.\\n1502: * **Use-case 2:** Users with an existing LPT pipeline and want to create a new CDK pipeline for ZAZ/FRA migration.\\n1503: * **Use-case 3:** Users with an existing CDK pipeline and want to improve CDK coverage for AWS resources within their accounts (Note we don’t transmogrify the existing CDK code, you’ll have to do some manual work to combine the generated code with the existing code).\\n1504: \\n1505: **Features**\\n1506: \\n1507: * With our discovery mechanism, builders can see existing AWS resources in their account and then select which ones they'd like transformed and CDKified into a new region.\\n1508: * Autofills the AWS Account information like Name, Stage and Region.\\n1509: * Creates new AWS Account on behalf of the builders or they can use an existing AWS Account.\\n1510: * Autoselect dependent resources based on the selected resources (e.g. KMS keys for a DynamoDB table) for a successful deployment.\\n1511: * Vends a new CDK Package for the service or builders bring their own CDK Package.\\n1512: * Generates a CR with the applicable CDK resources for the selected resources for ZAZ/FRA. We have recorded a demo for [deploying the CR](https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/1465175).\\n1513: * Try it more than once; with hundreds to thousands of resources in an account, builders can come back to Replicator after the first time and run it again with new selections and new CR(s).

Create equivalent environments to your existing DUB environments, named eu-south-2. This should be sibling to your existing environment, e.g., naming your environment *MyService/eu-south-2* not *MyService/EU/eu-south-2*, and naming your hostclass similarly. General instructions for creating environments and Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) can be found on [Builder Hub](https://builderhub.corp.amazon.com/docs/apollo/user-guide/apollo-cloud-control-setup.html).\\n1573: 2. Create the new Apollo environment:\\n1574:     1. Navigate to your DUB Apollo environment in Apollo.

Find the Parent Hostclass attribute and click on the hyperlink. For example, it might be *MYSERVICE-DUB*. This will take you to [infrastructure.amazon.com](https://infrastructure.amazon.com/automation)\\n1589:             1. Note down the name of this parent hostclass,\\n1590:         3. Look for the parent hostclass name in the HMP link here: https://bindles.amazon.com/hostclass-management-portal/.\\n1591:             1. Note down the Primary owner, Secondary Owner, Financial owner\\n1592:                ![Finding host class primary, secondary and financial owner](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/replicator_module/hostclass_info.png)\\n1593:     2. Navigate back to your parent hostclass in [infrastructure.amazon.com](https://infrastructure.amazon.com/automation)\\n1594:         1. Use the **Host Class** browser to find the parent hostclass. Click on the parent hostclass. For example, *MYSERVICE.*\\n1595:            ![Using the host class browser](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/replicator_module/navigate_hostclass_browser.png)\\n1596:         2. Click **Create Child Hostclass.**\\n1597:             1. Under *New Hostclass:*, append the name of the region to the parent hostclass name. For example, MYSERVICE-EU-SOUTH-2\\n1598:             2. Fill in the other attributes with the ones you copied in Bindles.\\n1599:         3. Click **Set CTI** and follow the remaining steps to create this hostclass.\\n1600: 4. You have now created your base child environment for your new region. These steps are similar for your Stages (e.g. Alpha/Beta/Gamma/OneBox/Prod)\\n1601:     1. Using the attributes/nomenclature of your previous region, copy the attributes/hostclass hierarchy over to the new region.\\n1602: 5. Follow https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/apollo/user-guide/howto-apollo-cloud-control-setup/ in configuring your auto-scaling groups.\\n1603: 6. Transfer in the capacity you ordered previously in the previous lessons from Fleet Management Console, or order hardware from the ASGs directly.\\n1604: 7. Setup PMET monitors and Carnaval alarms to monitor the load on your hosts.\\n1605:    * If your ZAZ/FRA environment is in an AWS account created after July 29 2024, follow Monitor Webservice’s [onboarding guide](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/MonitoringWebService/Docs/MWSAuthorization/OnboardingGuide/#HIhaveanewaccountinNAWSandusingMetricAgenttopublishmetrics.WhatistheminimumchangeIneed3F) to provision compute-level fine grain permission for PMET metric publishing, otherwise your metrics will not be published.\\n1606: \\n1607: 8. Using your DUB endpoint configuration, follow the [Tardigrade creation guidance by L7](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/L7/Tardigrade/User_Guide/ALB_Library/NewServiceUsingALB/#HALBResourceprovisioning) to create a new LoadBalancer and Redfort certificate (if applicable).\\n1608:    * Note If your ZAZ/FRA environment is in an AWS account created after July 29 2024, follow Monitor Webservice’s [onboarding guide](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/MonitoringWebService/Docs/MWSAuthorization/OnboardingGuide#HIhaveanewaccountinNAWSandusingMetricAgenttopublishmetrics.WhatistheminimumchangeIneed3F) to provision permission for PMET metric publishing before this certificate is in the path of any traffic, otherwise you will get a sev2 like [this](https://sim.amazon.com/issues/V1668892088) once your NAWS compute boots up.\\n1609: \\n1610: \\n1611: #### Use Case 3: Clone Your Infrastructure Stacks Internal Managed Runtime\\n1612: Amazon's internal offerings include various managed runtime options that can automatically create and manage the basic hardware and software infrastructure required to run SDO services. If your service uses an internal managed runtime provider such as HEX-Prod, HEX-AWS, Honeycomb, Datapath, or ORCA follow the instructions linked below to copy over your resources.

For example, you may need to search through your IaC package, such as CDK and LPT, and look for entries like DUB, eu-west-1, and EU. After inspecting these, you will need to determine if equivalent values are required for the new eu-south-2 (ZAZ) region.\\n1627: \\n1628: ***Sample CDK change for support new Region***\\n1629: ```\\n1630: export const pipelineEnvironments = {\\n1631:   ALPHA: newEnvironment(\\n1632:     AccountId.ALPHA, \\n1633:     Region.US_WEST_2, \\n1634:     EnvName.ALPHA\\n1635:   ),\\n1636:   GAMMA: newEnvironment(\\n1637:     AccountId.GAMMA_US_EAST_1,\\n1638:     Region.US_EAST_1,\\n1639:     EnvName.GAMMA_US_EAST_1\\n1640:   ),\\n1641:   PROD_US_EAST_1: newEnvironment(\\n1642:     AccountId.PROD_US_EAST_1,\\n1643:     Region.US_EAST_1,\\n1644:     EnvName.PROD_US_EAST_1\\n1645:   ),\\n1646:   PROD_US_WEST_2: newEnvironment(\\n1647:     AccountId.PROD_US_WEST_2,\\n1648:     Region.US_WEST_2,\\n1649:     EnvName.PROD_US_WEST_2\\n1650:   ),\\n1651:   PROD_EU_WEST_1: newEnvironment(\\n1652:     AccountId.PROD_EU_WEST_1,\\n1653:     Region.EU_WEST_1,\\n1654:     EnvName.PROD_EU_WEST_1\\n1655:   ),\\n1656:   /**\\n1657:    * Sample: below add the new ZAZ environment (EU South 2)\\n1658:    * The new pipelineEnvironment will be used throughout the CDK package\\n1659:    */\\n1660:   PROD_EU_SOUTH_2: newEnvironment(\\n1661:     AccountId.PROD_EU_SOUTH_2,\\n1662:     Region.EU_SOUTH_2,\\n1663:     EnvName.PROD_EU_SOUTH_2\\n1664:   ),\\n1665: };\\n1666: ```\\n1667: \\n1668: For resources NOT defined by Infrastructure as Code:\\n1669: * Follow the instructions in this [User Guide](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Alkimia/UserGuide/) to use Alkimia to replicate those resources.

The process generally involves listing all the policies, getting policy documents, and then creating them in the new account. Here is a high-level overview of how you might do it, using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).\\n1682: \\n1683: There are two types of policies: [AWS Managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies) and [Customer Managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#customer-managed-policies) IAM Policies.\\n1684: \\n1685: You do not need to copy AWS Managed Policies from one account to another, as they are already available in all AWS accounts. If you need to attach AWS Managed Policies to users, groups, and roles in the new account, you can simply do so by referencing them by their ARN (Amazon Resource Name), which remains consistent across all AWS accounts.\\n1686: \\n1687: _AWS Managed Policies_  \\n1688: To find out what managed policies are attached to specific users or roles in your source region, you can use the AWS Management Console or AWS Command Line Interface(CLI).\\n1689: \\n1690: AWS Management Console\\n1691: \\n1692: 1. Get Console Access\\n1693: 1. Navigate to the IAM service\\n1694: 1. Click on \\\"Users\\\" in the sidebar.\\n1695: 1. Select for user to view details.\\n1696: 1. In the \\\"Permissions\\\" tab, you can see policies attached to the user, including managed policies.\\n1697: 1. You can check for Roles by clicking on \\\"Roles\\\" in the sidebar.\\n1698: 1. Select a role to view its details.\\n1699: 1. In the \\\"Permissions\\\" tab, you'll see policies attached to the role.\\n1700: \\n1701: Alternative: Use AWS CLI\\n1702: \\n1703: 1. Identify users in your source account \\\"**AWS iam list-users**\\\"\\n1704: 1. See managed policies attached to the user or role: \\\"**aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name [username]**\\\"\\n1705: 1. \\\"**aws iam list-attached-role-policies role-name[rolename]**\\\"\\n1706: 1. Make sure the users or roles listed in your source account exists in your new account.\\n1707: 1. Attach the managed policies to users, groups, or roles that you discovered to the users in the new account following the steps below with commands like the following.\\n1708: \\n1709: ```\\n1710: aws iam attach-user-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdminstratorAccess --user-name<user-name>\\n1711: ```\\n1712: \\n1713: ```\\n1714: aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess --role-name<role-name>\\n1715: ```\\n1716: \\n1717: ```\\n1718: aws iam attach-group-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess --group-name<group-name>\\n1719: ```\\n1720: \\n1721: _Customer Managed Policies_\\n1722: \\n1723: 1. List policies in the Source Account by typing \\\"**aws iam list-policies --scope Local**\\\" command to get a list of all the custom IAM policies in the source account.\\n1724: 1. For each policy listed by the previous command, use \\\"**aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn <policy_arn> --version-id <version_id>**\\\" to get the policy document. Replace **<policy-arn>** with the ARN of the policy and **<version_id>** to get the policy document.\\n1725: 1. For each policy document retrieved from the source account, verify if there are any specific source account ARNs mentioned in the `Resource` section of each policyDocument's statement(s).\\n1726: \\n1727:   1. The below example illustrates a specific source account ARN being used in the `Resource` section.\\n1728: \\n1729: ```\\n1730:     {\\n1731:         \\\"Version\\\": \\\"2012-10-17\\\",\\n1732:         \\\"Statement\\\": [{\\n1733:             \\\"Sid\\\": \\\"Statement1\\\",\\n1734:             \\\"Effect\\\": \\\"Allow\\\",\\n1735:             \\\"Action\\\": [\\n1736:                 \\\"dynamodb:PutItem\\\"\\n1737:             ],\\n1738:             \\\"Resource\\\": [\\n1739:                 \\\"arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:390xxxxxxxx:table/AuditTable\\\"\\n1740:             ]\\n1741:         }]\\n1742:     }\\n1743: ```\\n1744: \\n1745:   1. While replicating/copying this policy to the target/destination AWS account, we have to ensure that the ARN present in the `Resource`(key) value should be the target AWS account, as shown below.\\n1746: \\n1747: ```\\n1748:     {\\n1749:         \\\"Version\\\": \\\"2012-10-17\\\",\\n1750:         \\\"Statement\\\": [{\\n1751:             \\\"Sid\\\": \\\"Statement1\\\",\\n1752:             \\\"Effect\\\": \\\"Allow\\\",\\n1753:             \\\"Action\\\": [\\n1754:                 \\\"dynamodb:PutItem\\\"\\n1755:             ],\\n1756:             \\\"Resource\\\": [\\n1757:                 \\\"arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:<destination-aws-account>:table/AuditTable\\\"\\n1758:             ]\\n1759:         }]\\n1760:     }\\n1761: ```\\n1762: 1. Please modify such ARNs by replacing the source AWS account id with destination AWS account id. For each of your updated policy documents retrieved from the source account, use the \\\"**aws iam create-policy --policy-name <policy_name> --policy-document <file://><path_to_policy_json>**\\\" command in the destination account to create the policy. Replace **<policy_name>** with the name you want to give the policy in the new account and **<path_to_policy_json>** with the path to the JSON document containing the policy.\\n1763: 1. You can automate this process by writing a script that loops through each policy, retrieves it, and then creates it in the new account.\\n1764: 1. Note: Before you create the new policy in the destination account, ensure AWS CLI is configured with the destination account credentials \\\"**policy_name=$(echo $policy | cut -d '/' -f 2)**\\\"\\n1765: \\n1766: Ensure you have the necessary permissions in both the source and destination accounts. Validate the policies to make sure you have copied them correctly.\\n1767: \\n1768: 1. List Entities in Source and New Account.\\n1769:   1.

This has led to confusion about how to test new regions.\\n1796: The following table provides recommendations on where your devo corp environment should run, using the DUB to ZAZ + FRA migration as the example use case.\\n1797: \\n1798: | My current alpha and/or beta environment is... | Recommendation |\\n1799: | --- |  --- |\\n1800: | One environment in PDX | Keep using your existing environment as is. |\\n1801: | Three environments in PDX corp, one for testing each region | Keep using your existing environments as is. |\\n1802: | One environment in PDX, but I need to test cross-region functionality | Keep using your PDX environment and set up a second devo environment in IAD to test cross-region functionality.<br><br>Leverage the new realm recommendation for this new IAD environment. |\\n1803: | One environment each in PDX, IAD, and DUB corp | Continue using your DUB environment for testing the traffic that will now go to ZAZ + FRA.<br><br>It's recommended to switch to the new realm recommendation (i.e., eu-west-1) for the devo DUB environment. This will be better aligned with your ZAZ + FRA environment's configuration, increasing what you get out of the test environment.<br><br>Plan to eventually utilize only PDX and IAD in corp. |\\n1804: \\n1805: **Wait...I can keep my devo environments in DUB?**\\n1806: For now yes, if they're already there. These environments represent a very small number of servers and we recognize we haven't yet provided streamlined support to recreate these devo environments in other regions.\\n1807: \\n1808: **What if I have ZAZ-specific infrastructure patterns to test?**\\n1809: E.g., what if I call Amazon Simple Email Service, which for ZAZ has to call cross-region back to DUB?\\n1810: These types of patterns should be tested in gamma environments, which utilize the prod network fabric and thus can be set up in ZAZ and FRA for this type of testing.\\n1811: \\n1812: **What if I need to test every ream in alpha/beta?**\\n1813: This is not common and not recommended - gamma stages should be able to test out the realms you'll use in production, and your business configuration should be refactored to function in any region. If utilizing gamma is not viable in the near-term, you will need to create additional stacks in PDX for each new realm.\\n1814: \\n1815: **What if I'm building a new service?**\\n1816: Build the service region flexibly, so that it can serve test traffic for any region. Then run your devo corp environment in PDX, with IAD added as needed to test cross-region functionality.\\n1817: \\n1818: **What's the long-term plan for devo?**\\n1819: As services become region flexible, they will be able to take any test traffic in any region, and we expect to consolidate down to two devo environments per service. Based on capacity projections for the next few years, those environments would be hosted in PDX and IAD.\\n1820: \\n1821: ### Lesson 7.2: Set up a new stack (post Clone your infrastructure stack(s))\\n1822: \\n1823: > **_GOAL:_** After completing this lesson, you will have replicated AWS resources that have not been replicated in prior lessons.\\n1824: \\n1825: \\n1826: {{warning}}\\n1827:  Disclaimer: The content here is meant to target AWS account resources that were not replicated in previous lessons.\\n1828: {{/warning}}\\n1829: \\n1830: Resources are the individual components of infrastructure, such as Apollo environment or pipelines. There are a lot of such components at Amazon and the pieces of infrastructure that make up your service constitute its boundary. It's important that you understand the current boundary of your resources as it relates to your service to know what you'll need to build in a new region.\\n1831: \\n1832: _Replicate your AWS resources_\\n1833: \\n1834: Identify the resources to migrate.\\n1835: \\n1836: If you already have resources managed by Infrastructure as Code (e.g. CDK / CloudFormation), modify your code to deploy your resources to the new region\\n1837: \\n1838: For resources NOT defined by Infrastructure as Code:\\n1839: * Follow the instructions in this [User Guide](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Alkimia/UserGuide/) to use Alkimia to replicate those resources.  This [list](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Alkimia/Features/) covers all the resources that can be mapped by Alkimia.\\n1840:     * use Alkimia to move your AWS resources such as IAM roles, DDB roles, S3 buckets\\n1841: \\n1842: Additional guidance on migrating resources using Alkimia can be found here: on slack: [#alkimia-interest](https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C04DV31F9M0)\\n1843: \\n1844: \\n1845: Alternatively, For the resources that cannot be covered by Alkimia, you have a few options:\\n1846: * Supplement the CDK generated by Alkimia by adding code to model those resources (preferred)\\n1847: * Create them in the new region manually using AWS tooling (e.g. Management Console, Command Line Interface)\\n1848: \\n1849: #### Example guidance for replicating IAM resources using AWS Command Line Interface\\n1850: \\n1851: Copying all IAM policies from one AWS account to another is not a direct, single-step process since IAM policies are objects within an AWS account that needs to be recreated in the new account. The process generally involves listing all the policies, getting policy documents, and then creating them in the new account. Here is a high-level overview of how you might do it, using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).\\n1852: \\n1853: There are two types of policies: [AWS Managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies) and [Customer Managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#customer-managed-policies) IAM Policies.\\n1854: \\n1855: You do not need to copy AWS Managed Policies from one account to another, as they are already available in all AWS accounts. If you need to attach AWS Managed Policies to users, groups, and roles in the new account, you can simply do so by referencing them by their ARN (Amazon Resource Name), which remains consistent across all AWS accounts.\\n1856: \\n1857: _AWS Managed Policies_  \\n1858: To find out what managed policies are attached to specific users or roles in your source region, you can use the AWS Management Console or AWS Command Line Interface(CLI).\\n1859: \\n1860: AWS Management Console\\n1861: \\n1862: 1. Get Console Access\\n1863: 1. Navigate to the IAM service\\n1864: 1. Click on \\\"Users\\\" in the sidebar.\\n1865: 1. Select for user to view details.\\n1866: 1. In the \\\"Permissions\\\" tab, you can see policies attached to the user, including managed policies.\\n1867: 1. You can check for Roles by clicking on \\\"Roles\\\" in the sidebar.\\n1868: 1. Select a role to view its details.\\n1869: 1. In the \\\"Permissions\\\" tab, you'll see policies attached to the role.\\n1870: \\n1871: Alternative: Use AWS CLI\\n1872: \\n1873: 1. Identify users in your source account \\\"**AWS iam list-users**\\\"\\n1874: 1. See managed policies attached to the user or role: \\\"**aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name [username]**\\\"\\n1875: 1. \\\"**aws iam list-attached-role-policies role-name[rolename]**\\\"\\n1876: 1. Make sure the users or roles listed in your source account exists in your new account.\\n1877: 1. Attach the managed policies to users, groups, or roles that you discovered to the users in the new account following the steps below with commands like the following.\\n1878: \\n1879: ```\\n1880: aws iam attach-user-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdminstratorAccess --user-name<user-name>\\n1881: ```\\n1882: \\n1883: ```\\n1884: aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess --role-name<role-name>\\n1885: ```\\n1886: \\n1887: ```\\n1888: aws iam attach-group-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess --group-name<group-name>\\n1889: ```\\n1890: \\n1891: _Customer Managed Policies_\\n1892: \\n1893: 1. List policies in the Source Account by typing \\\"**aws iam list-policies --scope Local**\\\" command to get a list of all the custom IAM policies in the source account.\\n1894: 1. For each policy listed by the previous command, use \\\"**aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn <policy_arn> --version-id <version_id>**\\\" to get the policy document. Replace **<policy-arn>** with the ARN of the policy and **<version_id>** to get the policy document.\\n1895: 1. For each policy document retrieved from the source account, verify if there are any specific source account ARNs mentioned in the `Resource` section of each policyDocument's statement(s).\\n1896: \\n1897: 1. The below example illustrates a specific source account ARN being used in the `Resource` section.\\n1898: \\n1899: ```\\n1900:  {\\n1901:      \\\"Version\\\": \\\"2012-10-17\\\",\\n1902:      \\\"Statement\\\": [{\\n1903:          \\\"Sid\\\": \\\"Statement1\\\",\\n1904:          \\\"Effect\\\": \\\"Allow\\\",\\n1905:          \\\"Action\\\": [\\n1906:              \\\"dynamodb:PutItem\\\"\\n1907:          ],\\n1908:          \\\"Resource\\\": [\\n1909:              \\\"arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:390xxxxxxxx:table/AuditTable\\\"\\n1910:          ]\\n1911:      }]\\n1912:  }\\n1913: ```\\n1914: \\n1915: 1. While replicating/copying this policy to the target/destination AWS account, we have to ensure that the ARN present in the `Resource`(key) value should be the target AWS account, as shown below.\\n1916: \\n1917: ```\\n1918:  {\\n1919:      \\\"Version\\\": \\\"2012-10-17\\\",\\n1920:      \\\"Statement\\\": [{\\n1921:          \\\"Sid\\\": \\\"Statement1\\\",\\n1922:          \\\"Effect\\\": \\\"Allow\\\",\\n1923:          \\\"Action\\\": [\\n1924:              \\\"dynamodb:PutItem\\\"\\n1925:          ],\\n1926:              \\\"arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:<destination-aws-account>:table/AuditTable\\\"\\n1927:          \\\"Resource\\\": [\\n1928:          ]\\n1929:      }]\\n1930:  }\\n1931: ```\\n1932: 1. Please modify such ARNs by replacing the source AWS account id with destination AWS account id. For each of your updated policy documents retrieved from the source account, use the \\\"**aws iam create-policy --policy-name <policy_name> --policy-document <file://><path_to_policy_json>**\\\" command in the destination account to create the policy. Replace **<policy_name>** with the name you want to give the policy in the new account and **<path_to_policy_json>** with the path to the JSON document containing the policy.\\n1933: 1. You can automate this process by writing a script that loops through each policy, retrieves it, and then creates it in the new account.\\n1934: 1. Note: Before you create the new policy in the destination account, ensure AWS CLI is configured with the destination account credentials \\\"**policy_name=$(echo $policy | cut -d '/' -f 2)**\\\"\\n1935: \\n1936: Ensure you have the necessary permissions in both the source and destination accounts. Validate the policies to make sure you have copied them correctly.\\n1937: \\n1938: 1. List Entities in Source and New Account.\\n1939: 1.

Recall your attestation. You should see a drop down menu asking \\\"Why are you recalling your application?\\\", and the options are \\\"EU Region Flexibility Campaign”, or \\\"Other\\\". By selecting the EU Region Flexibility Campaign drop down, you will have a simplified three-step experience to make the required changes to your attestation’s AWS Regions and update your Data Store Identifiers. The workflow will direct you through these required updates. Changes specific to EU Region Flex Campaigns will not require a Privacy Re-review. If you need to update other content in your Kale Attestation, select \\\"Other\\\" to see the entire recall workflow.\\n1961: \\n1962: \\n1963: ### Lesson 7.4: Ensure your run as user is available in region\\n1964: \\n1965: > **_GOAL:_** After completing this lesson, your service’s \\\"run as user\\\" will be available in destination region.\\n1966: \\n1967: \\n1968: {{warning}}\\n1969:  Please follow this step if your service is on MAWS, otherwise you can mark this lesson as Not Applicable and skip it.\\n1970: {{/warning}}\\n1971: \\n1972: New regions created since June 2019 (including ZAZ) do not automatically synchronize all system accounts to new regions ([ref](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AWS_IT_Security/ERA_Team/Security_Controls/Filtered_LDAP/#HFilteredLDAP)). These accounts are most often used as the \\\"Run as user\\\" in Apollo environments, and if the accounts are not synchronized to regions you're deploying to, you'll see an error like:\\n1973: \\n1974: ```\\n1975: user <run as user> does not exist in the system. Check the Run as User configured on the environment and consumed environments\\n1976: ```\\n1977: \\n1978: You can find your \\\"run as user\\\" in error messages like the above, or by navigating to your Apollo environment, selecting \\\"Edit this environment\\\" and searching for \\\"Run as user\\\". You can check if the account is synchronized to your new region at the Generic System Account Management ([GSAM](https://prod.gsam.afss.aws.dev/)) site by [listing all your accounts](https://prod.gsam.afss.aws.dev/list-accounts) or [searching for the specific account](https://prod.gsam.afss.aws.dev/). For existing accounts, you may need to find the owner of the account and have them add Bindles ownership before you can modify the record. If you get no results when searching for the \\\"Run as user\\\", then the system account does not exist, and [must be created](https://prod.gsam.afss.aws.dev/new-account).\\n1979: \\n1980: Once you've found or created the account in GSAM, you can add the region by navigating through Actions -> Edit -> Opt-in region -> Select the region in the dropdown -> Save. It should take an hour for the account to be available in the selected region(s).\\n1981: \\n1982: ### Lesson 7.5: Credentials, Certificate and Secret Management\\n1983: \\n1984: > **_GOAL:_** After completing this lesson, you will have set up your certificates and material sets in the destination region.\\n1985: \\n1986: \\n1987: {{warning}}\\n1988:  If you used Replicator, please skip some of this step (users still need to do ACM, but Redfort and Odin are covered)\\n1989: {{/warning}}\\n1990: \\n1991: For general best practices and guidance refer to the link [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Certificates). \\n1992: In Amazon, there are two certificate management products: Redfort and ACM (AWS Certificate Management). SDO teams are welcome to use either one of these.  Note that if Odin is used for storing credentials, each material set can only be assigned to a single region.\\n1993: - Note If your ZAZ/FRA environment is in an AWS account created after July 29 2024, follow Monitor Webservice’s [onboarding guide](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/MonitoringWebService/Docs/MWSAuthorization/OnboardingGuide#HIhaveanewaccountinNAWSandusingMetricAgenttopublishmetrics.WhatistheminimumchangeIneed3F) to provision permission for PMET metric publishing before this certificate is in the path of any traffic, otherwise you will get a sev2 like [this](https://sim.amazon.com/issues/V1668892088) once your NAWS compute boots up.\\n1994: \\n1995: **Recommended Golden Path**: The easiest and safest way to create your certs and Odin Materials for the ZAZ region is to **create a new endpoint for ZAZ**. For example, if you have ServiceName.DUB.Amazon.com as your endpoint in DUB, create a new endpoint like ServiceName.ZAZ.Amazon.com for ZAZ. This will allow you to test their new service through the ZAZ endpoint, and this endpoint can then either be used by clients directly, or used through re-direct from DUB→ZAZ. Once you create a new endpoint, you can request a certificate for this new endpoint in Redfort and ACM, which will be delivered as a new Odin Material Set. Remember, in Redfort, you can only create one certificate per endpoint, and only one Odin material set associated with the certificate. So, if you have an Odin Material Set already for DUB, you cannot create one for ZAZ. And although you may be able to get two Odin Material Sets for DUB and ZAZ through ACM, it’s a long an arduous task, so we ask to create a separate endpoint for safe and clean cert assignments.\\n1996: \\n1997: #### Lesson 7.5.1: Create Odin Material Sets\\n1998: {{warning}}\\n1999:  If you are utilizing Replicator, then Replicator will have prompted you to replicate your Odin MaterialSets already. If not using Replicator or replicating additional Odin MaterialSets then follow the instructions below.\\n2000: {{/warning}}\\n2001: \\n2002: ZAZ is an opt-in region for Odin. This means that Odin material sets for ZAZ cannot be shared with other regions such as DUB. Teams must create new material sets to use for ZAZ (this will also be true for all future regions SDO expands to, and is true for AWS teams as well). The Odin UI no longer supports creating new material sets, however, creation through the [Odin Admin CLI](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Odin/Admin/Reference/) is supported.\\n2003: \\n2004: For teams with a business critical need to share material sets between DUB and ZAZ (i.e., sharing encryption keys that need to be usable in multiple regions), there is an exception process to allowlist material sets for IAD/DUB/PDX as well as ZAZ. Note that these exceptions are only approved after the use case is validated that your team is unable to use separate material sets. File a Ticket [here](https://t.corp.amazon.com/create/templates/68a184c6-ea59-4e23-920b-29d446d4f030) with your exception requests.\\n2005: \\n2006: Note: The Odin team no longer supports creating new material sets via the Odin UI (<https://odin.amazon.com/.>) See below for how to create new material sets using the Odin CLI:\\n2007: \\n2008: 1. You need the OdinTools Apollo env on your Cloud Developer Desktop to use the Odin CLI. Check your Dev Desktop pipeline to see if you already have it. If not, see <https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Odin/Admin/Reference/InstallCLI/>\\n2009: 1. Use this Odin doc reference for how to use the Odin CLI to create a new material set: <https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Odin/Admin/Reference/CreateMaterialSetAWSBindles>\\n2010:     1. If you get an \\\"AccessDeniedException\\\" error message when creating the material set, it means you do not have access to create the material set under that Odin namespace.\\n2011:     1. You can either update your permissions in Bindles for \\\"Odin Namespace Permissions\\\" and make sure you have permission \\\"Can create material set under Odin Namespace\\\", or you can create a new Odin namespace to use for your new Odin material set.\\n2012:     1. If your existing material set is in Odin namespace ``com.amazon.access``, you will need to use your own Odin namespace because ``com.amazon.access`` is reserved for the Conduit team.\\n2013:     1. Use this Odin doc reference for how to use the Odin CLI to create a new namespace: <https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Odin/Admin/Reference/ReserveNamespace>\\n2014:     1. Use `-nf` for newFeature (new region). This will trigger a review via [Consensus](https://consensus.a2z.com/) that your direct manager will have to approve.\\n2015: 1. If your Odin material set contains AWS credentials for an IAM User in your Conduit-managed AWS account, please follow the steps to have Conduit periodically rotate your credentials: <https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/ACMF/CloudAccessManagementPermissions/Features/CredentialRotation/>\\n2016:     1. Note that Amazon Security is planning to have teams migrate off long-lived AWS credentials, such as IAM Users, and have teams migrate to short-lived AWS credentials like IAM Roles directly or IAM Roles in Turtle. So if you are using IAM Users you should plan that you'll have to migrate off IAM Users in 2024/2025 and onto IAM Roles. You can ignore this bullet if you are using the Odin material set for something other that AWS credentials.\\n2017:     1. Note: Do not request an exeption/allowlist for Odin material sets that are IAM Users. The solution is to create another IAM User, and then use the new IAM User material set for ZAZ-only (or even better, switch to using IAM Roles).\\n2018: \\n2019: #### Lesson 7.5.2: Create Certificates\\n2020: For general best practices and guidance refer to the link [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Certificates).\\n2021: In Amazon, there are two certificate management products: Redfort and ACM(AWS Certificate Management). SDO teams are welcome to use either one of these.\\n2022: \\n2023: To create certificates for ACM, follow the instructions in [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/ACM/Internal/Onboarding).\\n2024: \\n2025: {{info}}\\n2026:  To use an ACM certificate with Amazon CloudFront, you must request or import the certificate in the US East (N. Virginia) region. ACM certificates in this region that are associated with a CloudFront distribution are distributed to all the geographic locations configured for that distribution as mentioned [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-regions.html).\\n2027: {{/info}}\\n2028: \\n2029: {{warning}}\\n2030:  If you are utilizing Replicator, then Replicator will have prompted you to replicate\\n2031: {{/warning}}\\n2032: your Redfort certificates already.

CloudAuth verifies client access permissions before issuing tokens.\\n2039: \\n2040: To add an endpoint:\\n2041: \\n2042: -   Identify service endpoints\\n2043: -   In [AAA website](https://aaa.amazon.com/) > My Services > {Your Service Name} > Modify CloudAuth Endpoints\\n2044: -   Input HTTPS endpoints\\n2045: -   Select deployment region and authentication method\\n2046: \\n2047: ### Lesson 7.6: Setup Proxies (CDORelay, BigMesh, AWSSSLProxy)\\n2048: \\n2049: > **_GOAL:_** After completing this lesson, you will have set up your proxies.\\n2050: \\n2051: \\n2052: {{warning}}\\n2053:  This section focuses on services on MAWS that are using either CDORelay, BigMesh, or AWSSSLProxy.  If this does not apply to you, you can mark this lesson as Not Applicable and skip it. \\n2054: {{/warning}}\\n2055: \\n2056: This lesson outlines the manual process to onboard your proxy (CDOReplay, BigMesh, AWSSSLProxy) in a new region. We expect that you are already using a proxy and the same configuration will be replicated in new region. The following is the guideline to setup proxy in a new region, and is separated into two parts,\\n2057: 1. Identification of the underlying proxy technology\\n2058: 1. The corresponding onboarding steps\\n2059: \\n2060: #### Lesson 7.6.1 Identifying the underlying proxy technology\\n2061: \\n2062: The following sections describe how to identify if your service uses that particular proxy technology.

It will only ever be offered as a consumable environment. It is written in RUST. CDORelay relies on jlbrelay.cfg for configuration. CDORelay offers TLS termination, maxConns-based load shedding, and health check management. V1 does everything you need for simple CloudAuth-compatible TLS termination.\\n2067: \\n2068: 1. Go to your service pipeline https://pipelines.amazon.com/pipelines/<Pipeline_Name>\\n2069: 1. Check if “CDORelayConsumable/Release/Prod” is present in the “ConsumedEnvs”.\\n2070: 1. If present that means service is using JLBRelay/CDORelay V1 as proxy.\\n2071: 1.

It is accessible as a consumable environment and is developed using the Go programming language (GoLang). CDORelayV2 can use jlbrelay.cfg for configuration, but also offers a simpler bmruntimeproxy.cfg file that is easier to manage. CDORelayV2 was created so that SDO could add extensions for SDO-specific network behaviours that JLBRelay would never support. For example V2 offers Noise Gate (a load shedder that uses OPF headers to prioritize human traffic over bots/etc). V2 has native support for CloudAuth and Midway and also offers simpler server-side integration with BigMesh Load Balancer (also known as BigMesh Router, or SLR).\\n2079: \\n2080: Both CDORelayV1 and CDORelay V2 are currently in place in tier-1 services across Amazon. If you only need TLS termination then either will work.\\n2081: \\n2082: ![Understanding BigMesh Proxy connections and ports](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/setup_proxies/BigMesh_Operation.png)\\n2083: \\n2084: 1.

If you are already using a different method for Midway Authentication, then you do not need AWSSSLProxy.\\n2095: \\n2096: The AWSSSLProxy will listen on the normal ports (HTTP/80 and HTTPS/443), perform TLS termination, and perform Midway authentication. Once authenticated, the AWSSSLProxy will make a HTTP request to localhost on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1) with the original incoming request along with a special X-Forwarded-User header indicating the Midway identity of the requester.\\n2097: \\n2098: The application software will listen on a different port (e.g. HTTP/8080) and only accepts incoming requests that originate from the localhost.\\n2099: \\n2100: 1. Check if you are using AWSSSLProxyCurrent package in runtime dependency\\n2101: 1. Check if you are using AWSSSLProxy/AWSSSLProxyConsumable as consumable environment.\\n2102: 1. Check if you are using AWSSSLProxyConfig package in runtime dependency\\n2103: 1. If any of the above matches that means service is using AWSSSLProxy\\n2104: 1. AWS SSL Proxy configuration must be present in the apollo opconfig config package in the brazil-config folder (configuration > brazil-config > override > eg. opconfig.cfg\\n2105:     * Example of [opconfig.cfg](https://code.amazon.com/packages/AMSDetectiveService/blobs/mainline/--/configuration/brazil-config/global/opconfig.cfg)\\n2106: \\n2107: #### Lesson 7.6.2 Onboard proxy\\n2108: \\n2109: Now that you've identified the proxy technology being used, start by referring to see if the prerequisites have been satisfied and then refer to the appropriate section to see the detailed onboarding steps.\\n2110: \\n2111: ##### Prerequisites\\n2112: \\n2113: 1. Load balancer setup in new region should be completed. This will used to test the setup end to end (request travelling from original endpoint to service host).\\n2114: 1. DNS endpoint for new region (“ZAZ”) must be created.\\n2115: 1. Create SSL certificate in ZAZ if you are using HTTPS or TCP configuration. Not required for Http tardigrade listener. Redfort cert creation reference https://w.amazon.com/index.php/Redfort/FAQ#Q:_How_to_create_a_certificate_using_Redfort.3F\\n2116:    * Note If your ZAZ/FRA environment is in an AWS account created after July 29 2024, follow Monitor Webservice’s [onboarding guide](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/MonitoringWebService/Docs/MWSAuthorization/OnboardingGuide#HIhaveanewaccountinNAWSandusingMetricAgenttopublishmetrics.WhatistheminimumchangeIneed3F) to provision permission for PMET metric publishing before this certificate is in the path of any traffic, otherwise you will get a sev2 like [this](https://sim.amazon.com/issues/V1668892088) once your NAWS compute boots up.\\n2117: 1. Setup Odin Material (host with chain) - Add host class and user of ZAZ environment\\n2118: \\n2119: ##### CDO Relay\\n2120: \\n2121: In order for CDORelay to work, we need to have JLBRelay config file set up. This config sets up max conns, listening ports, and health checks. Normally we have one config file that uses domain and realms to distinguish settings.\\n2122: \\n2123: 1. Once relay config file is identified, check realm identifiers with `EU` prefix configuration in the file, like `EUAmazon`, `EUFulfillment`\\n2124:    * Example of config with `EUAmazon` https://code.amazon.com/packages/CROWCoralService/blobs/mainline/--/brazil-config/override/JlbRelay.cfg\\n2125:    * Example of config with `EUFulfillment` https://code.amazon.com/packages/FCPickDemandService/blobs/mainline/--/brazil-config/override/JlbRelay.cfg\\n2126: 1. You may find multiple entries for single environment such as HTTP, HTTPS, ClouthAuth, Tardigrade (without CIP), tardigrade (with CIP).\\n2127: 1. You need to **replicate** the following configurations from `EU` identifiers and **append** them for `eu-south-2`.\\n2128: 1. Port configurations can be reused across regions.\\n2129: \\n2130: Need to perform eu-south-2 changes in the below sample setup for EUAmazon realm.\\n2131: \\n2132: 1. marketplace\\n2133: 1.

This IMR Relief will provide a one-time DARU credit at the individual fleet level by negating the actual IMR cost incurred in ZAZ during the planned migration window. The offsetting DARU charge will be applied at the Parent F2 level. Participating fleets will also have credit score relief for the duration of the migration. Note that DUB to ZAZ migrations can be submitted at any point during the 2024 planning year in APD (or during 2024 OP2 planning cycle 10/25-11/17) but cannot be backdated.

A key implication is increased latency of communication: same-region network round-trip-times (RTT) are typically below 1ms, while cross-region network RTTs are 10s of milliseconds; for example, the DUB-ZAZ RTT ranges from 35ms to 65ms (see more detail [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/FAQs/#HHowwillservicelatencybeimpactedduringthemigration3F)). Your service may be affected if its direct dependency migrates so that your calls go cross-region; it may also be affected if a call made by your transitive dependency becomes cross-region (even if all calls your service makes stay in-region). Higher latency may lead to timeouts either in your service, or its dependencies. It may also increase CPU load. Prepare your service by following the lessons in this module. You can read more background in [this wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Timeouts).\\n2976: \\n2977: \\n2978: ### Lesson 8.1: Ensure your service has availability alarms in new regions\\n2979: \\n2980: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this lesson, you will have ensured that your team is aware when your new service stack is impaired.\\n2981: \\n2982: You can use monitor portal to replicate your MAWS service alarms (Pmet & Carnaval) across different AWS regions with just a few clicks. This feature is available on RFP under **Lesson 8.1: Ensure your service has availability alarms in new regions**.\\n2983: Otherwise, you can use the stand-alone tool [here](https://prod.replicator.tools.amazon.dev/monitor-replication/plans).\\n2984: \\n2985: Ideally, your service already has availability alarms. If your service has them in classic SDO regions (e.g. DUB), then copy the availability percentage alarms from the classic region to the new regions.\\n2986: \\n2987: Note: If the migration from a classic region (e.g. DUB) to a new region (e.g. ZAZ) involves the retirement of any APIs of your service then it’s OK not to copy those APIs’ availability monitors.\\n2988: \\n2989: If your service has no availability alarms in classic SDO regions, then please add them in new SDO regions first, and consider adding them in classic SDO regions as well (although RFE does not require you to).\\n2990: \\n2991: If in doubt about alarm configuration, then please —\\n2992: \\n2993: 1. Consult [guidance from CRRE on how to measure availability](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Consumer/ReliabilityEngineering/Guidance/#HAvailabilityMetricMeasurement).\\n2994: 2. Unless you know better, RFE recommends —\\n2995:     1. To use CDK infrastructure-as-code to define the new alarms; see [the BuilderHub manual](https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/native-aws/developer-guide/cdk-monitoring/).\\n2996:     2. To cut a Sev-2 ticket when 99% or less of all *valid* requests to a Prod endpoint are served successfully.\\n2997:     3. To use 1-minute metrics for alarming.\\n2998:     4. To alert when 3 consecutive data points are at or below the threshold.\\n2999:     5. To alert on missing data points.\\n3000:     6. To return the alarm to “OK” when 3 consecutive data points are above the threshold.\\n3001: 3. If still in doubt, consult with your tech lead or [#region-flexibility](https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C05D7C8PVDY).\\n3002: \\n3003: \\n3004: ### Lesson 8.2: Ensure your service has dependency call metric dashboards\\n3005: \\n3006: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this lesson, you will have reduced the time it takes to localize service impact to timeouts or other failures in calls to dependencies.\\n3007: \\n3008: When your on-call is paged because your service is impaired, they would need to check whether the impact is correlated with failures in dependency calls, and more specifically, whether timeout values may need to be adjusted. To enable that —\\n3009: \\n3010: 1. Your service should publish enough metrics to check whether calls to a specific dependency are failing and whether that’s caused by timeouts.\\n3011: 2. The metrics should be displayed on a dashboard that’s available and known to employees that have on-call duties for your service.\\n3012: \\n3013: For each endpoint that your service calls you should be able to see the following metrics (or their equivalents) —\\n3014: \\n3015: 1. Call latency: Time between starting a call (sending a request) and ending it (either receiving a response, timing out, or encountering an I/O or protocol error). Your dashboards should show the 99th percentile (p99) of latency; they can show lower and higher percentiles as well.\\n3016: 2. Call success: The percentage of calls attempted by your service that succeed (0%-100%).\\n3017: 3. Call timeout: The percentage of calls attempted by your service that time out (0%-100%).\\n3018: \\n3019: Notes:\\n3020: \\n3021: 1. We don’t recommend you alarm on these metrics; instead prefer to alarm on service-level indicators (SLIs) like your service’s availability. You can learn more about SLIs on the [CRRE SLI wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Consumer/ReliabilityEngineering/SLI).\\n3022: 2. We recommend to measure call success and call timeout separately because timeouts occurring in a service that your service invokes may manifest themselves to your service as non-success responses (e.g. HTTP status 500) rather than timeouts. It’s important to have both metrics to localize problems faster.\\n3023: 3. We recommend to measure call *success* rate rather than call *failure* rate because it makes the metric easier to test, easier to alarm on (if needed), and is consistent with common standard metrics (e.g. in Coral). Having said that, measuring call failure rate is sufficient to complete this lesson.\\n3024: \\n3025: **Exceptions**\\n3026: \\n3027: It's OK to skip following this recommendation for calls to endpoints that are *guaranteed* to remain in the same region as your service and whose latency will not be affected by cross-region migrations. These include —\\n3028: \\n3029: 1. In-region AWS service endpoints (excluding DynamoDB endpoints which your service uses to access tables planned to be migrated using [Hotwire](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Hotwire); Hotwire adds latency during migration).\\n3030: 2. In-region SDO storage service endpoints: Sable, Verto, G2S2 (excluding Sable endpoints which your service uses to access scopes that are planned to be migrated using Hotwire).\\n3031: \\n3032: Examples:\\n3033: \\n3034: |If your ZAZ or FRA stack is calling...\\t|Should you ensure dashboarding of call metrics?\\t|\\n3035: |---\\t|---\\t|\\n3036: |Some other service's LRA endpoint\\t|yes\\t|\\n3037: |Some other service's ZAZ/FRA/DUB endpoint\\t|yes\\t|\\n3038: |AWS service endpoint in a different region\\t|yes\\t|\\n3039: |AWS DynamoDB endpoint in same region (your team might use Hotwire for migrating data)\\t|yes\\t|\\n3040: |Sable endpoint in same region (your team might use Hotwire for migrating data)\\t|yes\\t|\\n3041: |AWS DynamoDB endpoint in same region (your team will definitely not use Hotwire for migrating data)\\t|no*\\t|\\n3042: |Sable endpoint in same region (your team will definitely not use Hotwire for migrating data)\\t|no*\\t|\\n3043: |AWS service (not DynamoDB) in the same region\\t|no*\\t|\\n3044: |Verto or G2S2 in the same region\\t|no*\\t|\\n3045: \\n3046: [*] While there is not a region flexibility benefit in adding these metrics, they will improve your team's operational posture by accelerating root cause identification should these calls fail, and you should consider adding them.\\n3047: \\n3048: **Implementing using Axon metrics**\\n3049: \\n3050: [Axon](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Axon) is an observability tool that lets service owners discover and monitor their callers and dependencies (callees). Your service is already onboarded to Axon if it was onboarded to [Convoy](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AutoAug/Convoy) (see Module 2 of this guide). Axon provides the *call latency* metric automatically. The following sections describe other ways of ensuring you have all the call metrics we recommend.\\n3051: \\n3052: The fastest way to check whether your service has Axon, is to open [the Axon UI](https://axon.ops.amazon.dev/service-graph) and search for the name of one of your environments (for example, [Axon page for Detail Page EU Prod](https://axon.ops.amazon.dev/service-graph/HorizontePlatform/Detail/EU/Prod)). If you onboarded to Axon (including creating the PrivateLink required for NAWS services) and yet don’t find your environments in Axon UI, it may be because the relevant code changes haven’t been deployed yet.\\n3053: \\n3054: If your service is on Axon, then it publishes call latency metrics to MWS with `metricclass=$CLIENT_TELEMETRY$`. For example, [ProductDeliveryExperienceAggregatorService/EU/Prod CLIENT_TELEMETRY Latency p99](https://monitorportal.amazon.com/igraph?SchemaName1=Search&Pattern1=marketplace%3D%24eu-west-1%24%20dataset%3D%24Prod%24%20servicename%3D%24ProductDeliveryExperienceAggregatorService%2FEU%2FProd%24%20metricclass%3D%24CLIENT_TELEMETRY%24%20schemaname%3DService%20methodname%3D%24ProductDeliveryExperienceAggregatorServiceEU.ProductDeliveryExperienceAggregatorService.GetProductDeliveryInformationSummary%24%20metric%3D%28NOT%20_ERROR%24%29&Period1=OneMinute&Stat1=p99&ValueUnit1=millisecond&HeightInPixels=250&WidthInPixels=600&GraphTitle=ProductDeliveryExperienceAggregatorService%2FEU%2FProd%3A%20CLIENT_TELEMETRY%20Latency%20p99&DecoratePoints=true&StartTime1=-PT3H&EndTime1=-PT0M&FunctionExpression1=S1&FunctionLabel1=%7BmetricLabel%7D%20%5Bavg%3A%20%7Bavg%7D%5D&FunctionYAxisPreference1=left) displays the 99th percentile of latency that ProductDeliveryExperienceAggregatorService experiences when it calls Axon-visible dependencies.\\n3055: \\n3056: You can include the Axon latency metric in your service's new regional dashboards (ZAZ, FRA). If your service already publishes sufficient call metrics on its own, then we don't ask you to change your dashboards to display Axon metrics; we only suggest using Axon metrics to potentially reduce your effort.\\n3057: \\n3058: **Implementing using Coral metrics**\\n3059: \\n3060: For calls made using [CoralClient](https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/coral/user-guide/ref-coral-javaclient), ensuring that CoralClient metrics are published by your service to either MWS or CloudWatch (and displayed on a dashboard) would be enough to meet our recommendation, because it implements the following metrics —\\n3061: \\n3062: 1. Call latency: `metric=Latency` ([wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Coral/Metrics/Common#Latency))\\n3063: 2. Call success: `metric=Availability:Critical` ([wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Coral/Metrics/Common#Availability:Critical))\\n3064: 3. Call timeout: `metric=Timeout:Critical` ([wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Coral/Metrics/Common#Timeout:Critical))\\n3065: \\n3066: If you're using CoralClient but don't see these metrics for some of your Coral dependencies, please ensure that your code is passing a CoralMetrics `Metrics` object to the client call. Below is a trivial example.\\n3067: \\n3068: ```java\\n3069: // One line from an imaginary ExampleActivity.java\\n3070: // Before the fix:\\n3071: final ExampleOutput output = exampleClient.callExampleOperation(exampleInput);\\n3072: // After the fix:\\n3073: final ExampleOutput output = exampleClient.callExampleOperation(exampleInput, getMetrics());\\n3074: ```\\n3075: \\n3076: If your service is a simple Coral service, use [`Activity.getMetrics()`](https://code.amazon.com/packages/CoralActivity/blobs/11d30b32ddf921ce6daaae917fa670d6d8fda131/--/main/com/amazon/coral/service/Activity.java#L49-L51) to get a `Metrics` object and pass it to either a generated `call*` client method (as per the above example) or to [`Call.setMetrics(Metrics)`](https://code.amazon.com/packages/CoralClientCall/blobs/b73298326466c8a27c724684f1f2a249a4a8c3c9/--/src/com/amazon/coral/service/Call.java#L60-L65). In other cases, you may not have an `Activity` object handy, and would need to source the right metrics object differently; if in doubt, please consult [Sage](https://sage.amazon.dev/tags/coral) or [#coral](https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C0180EDJUUT).\\n3077: \\n3078: iGraph examples:\\n3079: \\n3080: 1.

Once you got an answer to your question, we encourage you to contribute the answer back into this guide, by cutting a SIM [here](https://sim.amazon.com/issues/create?template=e508fcab-0d4d-4989-b473-f4f37b760955).\\n3092: \\n3093: **Note on REST-style service calls**\\n3094: \\n3095: If your service is calling a REST-style service and accesses different URLs for different business use cases with substantially different latency profiles (e.g. `GET /customer/benefit/-/` to determine benefit eligibility is fast; `GET /customer/profile/-/` to get the customer’s full profile is slow) then we recommend to publish separate call metrics for each. We’re calling out REST in particular, because CoralClient provides separate metrics for each operation “out of the box”.\\n3096: \\n3097: \\n3098: ### Lesson 8.3: Prepare configuration for cross-region latency\\n3099: \\n3100: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this lesson, you will have taken action to prevent some problems due to client configuration settings.\\n3101: \\n3102: **Remove `maxConnectionsPerHost` and `maxTotalConnections` settings from Coral configuration files**\\n3103: \\n3104: Coral configuration allows defining upper limits on how many connections one client host may open against a service (`maxTotalConnections`) or how many connections it may open against one server host (`maxConnectionsPerHost`).\\n3105: We recommend you remove assignments to those configuration keys in client configuration packages that your team owns.\\n3106: \\n3107: ```\\n3108: BarService#Base.DUB.Prod : {\\n3109:    \\\"httpEndpoint\\\" : {\\n3110:      \\\"url\\\" : \\\"https://prod.barservice.dub.amazon.com:443\\\"\\n3111:    },\\n3112:    \\\"httpClient\\\" : {\\n3113:      \\\"maxConnectionsPerHost\\\" : 30, // remove this line\\n3114:      \\\"maxTotalConnections\\\" : 30    // remove this line\\n3115:    }\\n3116:  }\\n3117: ```\\n3118: \\n3119: **Why?** When your service’s dependency’s latency increases (either due to it moving behind a cross-region link or some of its dependencies doing the same) that is likely to increase the number of concurrently open connections, which will increase the likelihood of hitting one of these limits. Coral team advises its customers to instead rely on [Automatic Admission Control](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Coral/Campaigns/AutomatedAdmissionControlCampaign) to prevent overload, rather than on arbitrary limits that will become outdated once there are changes in the latency profile of the callee or the scaling of the caller.\\n3120: \\n3121: **Ensure Coral `connectionTimeout` is 500ms or more, if explicitly set**\\n3122: \\n3123: Coral configuration allows setting an upper bound on how much time it takes to establish a secure HTTP connection from the client to the server, via the `connectionTimeout` key. We recommend you ensure this timeout value is at least 500ms.\\n3124: \\n3125: ```\\n3126: BarService#Base.DUB.Prod : {\\n3127:    \\\"httpEndpoint\\\" : {\\n3128:      \\\"url\\\" : \\\"https://prod.barservice.dub.amazon.com:443\\\"\\n3129:    },\\n3130:    \\\"httpClient\\\" : {\\n3131:      \\\"connectionTimeout\\\" : 200 // increase this to 500\\n3132:    }\\n3133:  }\\n3134: ```\\n3135: \\n3136: If your Coral configuration files do not set `connectionTimeout` then **don’t add it**. Coral’s default value is 2500ms which already meets our recommendation.\\n3137: \\n3138: **Why?** When we use HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 with TLS for client-server communication, it takes 3 round-trip times (RTTs) to establish a secure connection before any application request can be sent. In order to prepare for your dependencies’ endpoints to be on the other side of a cross-region network path, your connection timeouts should be at least 3x of the maximum RTT. For Exit DUB, the three regions at play are DUB, ZAZ and FRA; among them, the longest RTT is 65ms, so 3x of that is 195ms. Allowing 100ms for server-side processing of each communication leg gives us a round 500ms lower bound on connection time.\\n3139: \\n3140: **Notify your callers if you made changes**\\n3141: \\n3142: If you made any changes in this lesson, we recommend that you notify the owners of packages consuming your client configuration package, to give them the opportunity to re-run stress tests for the services that use the configuration. You can find CTIs to cut tickets to as follows — \\n3143: \\n3144: 1. Use Code Search to find packages consuming your configuration package; for example [this search query](https://code.amazon.com/search?term=fp%3AConfig+status%3Aactive+%22MarketplaceDeliveryPromiseServiceClientConfig+%3D+1.0%22) finds consumers of `MarketplaceDeliveryPromiseServiceClientConfig-1.0`.\\n3145: 2. For each identified package — \\n3146:     1. Navigate to the Permissions tab, and click on the Bindle link.\\n3147:     2. On the Bindle page, click on “See more” to see the CTI for the Bindle.\\n3148: \\n3149: Make sure to include the URL of the commit with the changes in the ticket, so that consumers know what changes you’re referring to and can ensure to have merged from them from live before re-running tests.\\n3150: \\n3151: \\n3152: ### Lesson 8.4: Ensure your run-book can help your on-call change call timeout values\\n3153: \\n3154: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this lesson, you will have made your run-book helpful when your on-call needs to change a timeout value.\\n3155: \\n3156: We recommend that you edit your team’s runbook to include code links that would help an on-call increase call timeout values when necessary, without spending time researching which service configurations or code hold these values. Below we list some of the ways call timeouts could be set; please note that it’s not exhaustive.\\n3157: \\n3158: **Changing CoralClient configuration**\\n3159: \\n3160: If a service is using CoralClient to call BarService, it usually consumes default operation timeout settings via the BarServiceCoralConfig package that’s vended by the BarService team; looking, for example, like this —\\n3161: \\n3162: ```\\n3163:  BarService#Base.DUB.Prod : {\\n3164:    \\\"httpEndpoint\\\" : {\\n3165:      \\\"url\\\" : \\\"https://prod.barservice.dub.amazon.com:443\\\"\\n3166:    },\\n3167:    \\\"timeouts\\\" : {\\n3168:      \\\"operationTimeouts\\\" : {\\n3169:        \\\"BarService/*\\\" : 5000,\\n3170:        \\\"BarService/GetBeer\\\" : 750\\n3171:      }\\n3172:    }\\n3173:  }\\n3174: ```\\n3175: \\n3176: If your service becomes unhealthy due to timeouts calling a particular Coral service, you will need to adjust the operation timeout value your service uses to make that call, and deploy the resulting code changes. In the most common case, your service consumes that value from the dependency team’s package; thus to change the value without involving that team (which will take precious time), you will need to add an *override configuration file* to your service package; like this —\\n3177: \\n3178: ```\\n3179:  // YourService/configuration/coral-config/BarService-override.config\\n3180:  BarService#Base.DUB.Prod : {\\n3181:    \\\"timeouts\\\" : {\\n3182:      \\\"operationTimeouts\\\" :+ {\\n3183:        \\\"BarService/GetBeer\\\" : 1500\\n3184:      }\\n3185:    }\\n3186:  }\\n3187: ```\\n3188: \\n3189: **Changing programmatic call timeout settings**\\n3190: \\n3191: Your service may be setting call timeouts programmatically (not via a configuration file). The following subsections cover a few common HTTP client libraries. Edit your run-book to include links to code locations where those timeout values are set, so that they may be found quickly during an incident.

E.g., if you deploy to one region per pipeline stage today, you should add the new regions as new stages adjacent to the source region. However, while you’re working on getting the new regions set up, the pipeline stages may need to be placed elsewhere in the pipeline to accelerate your iteration speed. \\n3215: \\n3216: | If my current pipeline... | Then my new stages for ZAZ and FRA should... |\\n3217: | :-------- | :---------- |\\n3218: | Deploys to one region in each pipeline stage | Each be placed in its own new pipeline stage next to your existing DUB stage(s). <br /><br /> Deploy to one region at a time and utilize [Accelerated Releases](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CraneCD/AcceleratedReleases/StoresRegional/) to accelerate iteration speed while developing. <br /><br /> Be labeled as production stages once ready for production. | \\n3219: | Deploys to multiple regions in the same pipeline stage AND approves each region with DIFFERENT approval workflows\\t| Be placed in the same pipeline stage as your existing DUB stage(s). <br /><br />Utilize [Accelerated Releases](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CraneCD/AcceleratedReleases/StoresRegional/) to accelerate iteration speed while developing.<br /><br />Be labeled as production stages once ready for production. |\\n3220: | Deploys to multiple regions in the same pipeline stage AND approves all those regions with the SAME approval workflow\\t| Be placed at the start of your pipeline while iterating on getting the regions ready. <br /><br />Be moved to the same pipeline stage as your existing DUB stage(s) and labeled as production stages once ready for production.|\\n3221: \\n3222: ### Lesson 9.2: Accelerate your pipeline\\n3223: \\n3224: > **_GOAL:_** After completing this lesson, you should understand how workflows are applied to Accelerated Releases.\\n3225: \\n3226: Pipelines has provided a new feature called \\\"Dynamic Releases\\\". This allows you to accelerate changes to ZAZ while you are setting up the region, ensuring it gets changes quickly and doesn't block the rest of the pipeline. Regardless of where ZAZ is in your pipeline, it will always deploy to ZAZ first. Additional details on this feature and step by step guidance can be found [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CraneCD/AcceleratedReleases/StoresRegional/).\\n3227: \\n3228: ### Lesson 9.3: Add the ZAZ Region to your pipelines\\n3229: \\n3230: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this lesson, you should have the ZAZ region set up as a new stage in your pipelines.\\n3231: \\n3232: #### Lesson 9.3.1: Add the ZAZ region to your LPT pipelines\\n3233: \\n3234: {{warning}}\\n3235:  Please follow this step if your service is on LPT otherwise this can be skipped.\\n3236: {{/warning}}\\n3237: \\n3238: Update your pipeline to incorporate each new pipeline stage you're adding for the new region, incorporating equivalent testing workflows for the new region that you have in existing regions.\\n3239: \\n3240: If your service uses any LPT pipelines, please refer to the [general builderhub step-by-step guidance provided here](https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/mrc/user-guide/infrastructure-pipelines-one-touch/). If you are using \\\"retail_region\\\" list, please [refer to this guideline](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Icon/rfm/runbooks/LPT/).\\n3241: \\n3242: #### Lesson 9.3.2: Add the ZAZ region to your CDK pipelines\\n3243: \\n3244: {{warning}}\\n3245:  Please follow this step if your service is on NAWS otherwise this can be skipped.\\n3246: {{/warning}}\\n3247: \\n3248: If your service uses any CDK pipelines, please refer to the step-by-step guidance provided [here](https://builderhub.corp.amazon.com/docs/native-aws/developer-guide/cdk-howto-expand-pipeline.html)\\n3249: \\n3250: **Additional CDK guidance:**\\n3251: \\n3252: As a general rule of thumb, start with following your team's standard practice. But we will provide examples of how you can also do this in the following guide.\\n3253: \\n3254: ***Add a new stage***\\n3255: \\n3256: 1. Open your existing CDK package for your pipeline, open your app's entry point (**lib/app.ts** if you used BuilderHub Create)and add the following code.\\n3257: \\n3258: 2. **Construct and file names**\\n3259:     > This code example assumes that you have a stack called **InfraStack** defined in **lib/infraStack.ts**. If your stack and file have different names, replace them accordingly to your setup.\\n3260:     > In this code example, we use **beta** for the additional pipeline stage's name. You are free to choose a different name, but be aware that some libraries may expect specific stage names to function properly. For example, ApolloShimOpConfigHelpers only accepts **alpha, beta, gamma, and prod** by default.\\n3261:     > If you already have a CloudFormation stack with the name **Username-Infra-beta-us-west-2** in **us-west-2** region, choose a different name.\\n3262: \\n3263:     ![1705363375394-327.png](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/add_the_zaz_region_to_your_cdk_pipelines/1705363375394-327.png)\\n3264: 3. Build your CDK package locally by using **brazil-build.**\\n3265: \\n3266: 4.  Send a code review for the changes you made and get it approved; but don't merge the changes yet.\\n3267: \\n3268: 5. Since you are deploying to a new region in a new account, you will need to bootstrap that region. Perform the following steps.\\n3269:     1. [Brazil] **Brazil-build bootstrap**\\n3270:     2. [Peru] **./node_modules/.bin/amzn-cdk bootstrap or brazil-build run amzn-cdk bootstrap**\\n3271: \\n3272: 6. Merge the code review; let your pipeline self-mutate and add the new region automatically.\\n3273: \\n3274: 7. Once the pipeline deployment completes, you should see a new beta stage on your pipeline.\\n3275: \\n3276: ***Add a new region to an existing stage***\\n3277: \\n3278: Adding a new region to your beta stage is similar to adding [a new stage to the pipeline](https://builderhub.corp.amazon.com/docs/native-aws/developer-guide/cdk-howto-expand-pipeline.html#cdk-pipeline-add-new-stage). The main difference is that you don't need to create a new DeploymentGroupStage object via the pipeline.addStage() method. Instead, you will reuse the betaStage object.\\n3279: \\n3280: 1. Open your app's entry point and add the following code for the second region of the beta stage.\\n3281: \\n3282:     ![1705363643076-738.png](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/add_the_zaz_region_to_your_cdk_pipelines/1705363643076-738.png)\\n3283: \\n3284: 2. Build your CDK package locally using brazil-build.\\n3285: \\n3286: 3. Send code review for the changes you made and get it approved; but don't merge the changes yet.\\n3287: \\n3288: 4. Since you are deploying to a new region in a new account, you will need to bootstrap to that region. Perform the following steps.\\n3289:     1. [Brazil] **Brazil-build bootstrap**\\n3290:     2. [Peru] **./node_modules/.bin/amzn-cdk bootstrap or brazil-build run amzn-cdk bootstrap.**\\n3291: \\n3292: 5. [Enable your pipeline](https://builderhub.corp.amazon.com/docs/pipelines/user-guide/howto-edit-promotions.html)\\n3293: \\n3294: #### Lesson 9.3.3: [non-CDK] Adding the new ZAZ Apollo Environments (1-box and Prod) to Pipeline Stages\\n3295: \\n3296: {{warning}}\\n3297:  Please follow this step if your service is on MAWS otherwise this can be skipped.\\n3298: {{/warning}}\\n3299: \\n3300: Refer to this [link](https://builderhub.corp.amazon.com/docs/pipelines/user-guide/howto-add-environments.html) for BuilderHub pages\\n3301: \\n3302: 1. Go to your service pipeline\\n3303: 2. Go to Edit Tab\\n3304: 3. Click the Add Environments button\\n3305: 4. Enter the environment name (without the stage)\\n3306: 5. Check the box next to the environments you want to add\\n3307: 6. Select the stage you want to add that environment to from the drop-down list. (Prod)\\n3308: \\n3309: **Add Promotion Configuration Between Environments**\\n3310: \\n3311: 1. Go to the Edit tab\\n3312: 2. Click the Fill in promotions button (Note: This button will be disabled if all your environments have an incoming promotion)\\n3313: 3. Use the drop-down list to select the source for promotion.\\n3314: \\n3315: ### Lesson 9.4: Add/Update Carnaval Alarms\\n3316: \\n3317: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this lesson, you will understand the type and configuration for alarms, as well as when to set your alarm as active.\\n3318: \\n3319: Refer to this [link](https://builderhub.corp.amazon.com/docs/pipelines/user-guide/howto-configure-alarms.html) for BuilderHub pages  \\n3320: Pipelines publishes two types of alarms to Carnaval\\n3321: \\n3322: * **Pipeline status alarm**: Indicates the pipeline is disabled, blocked, or requires manual attention. You should already have these, but take this time to check and add them if not.\\n3323: * **Workflow step alarm**: Indicates a workflow step has failed or timed out. Look up your pipeline's Carnaval alarms, if you have workflow step alarms for other regions, create an equivalent alarm in the same manner as your existing ones for the new region.\\n3324: \\n3325: Before you can act on an alarm, you must create a Carnaval monitor.\\n3326: \\n3327: 1. Go to the **Notifications** tab and click **Create a monitor** next to the alarm you want to monitor (you will be taken to a Carnaval page)\\n3328:     1. The Carnaval page is automatically populated with the alarm rule, name, pipeline owner, and the notification e-mail for your pipeline. \\n3329: 2. Update the fields with exactly the type of alerts or emails you want when your workflow step fails. Note that newly created monitors will always start in an OK state\\n3330:    <div align=\\\"center\\\">\\n3331:      <img src=\\\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/add_update_carnaval_alarms/1705364786447-277.png\\\" alt=\\\"add_update_carnaval_alarms/1705364786447-277.png\\\">\\n3332:    </div>\\n3333:    \\n3334: 3. Carnaval will start tracking the state of the alarm after the monitor has been created. If an alarm is in ALERT state when you create the monitor, you can set the correct state in Carnaval manually to match the state displayed in Pipelines.\\n3335: 4. After the monitor gets created, the notification page will link to it.\\n3336: \\n3337: Note: When possible, consider temporarily disabling alarming (e.g., emitting tickets, sending notifications) until it is needed closer to launch. Doing so could reduce the avoidable operational burdens that come with misfired tickets.\\n3338: \\n3339: \\n3340: ### Lesson 9.5: Multi-Region Metric Monitoring in MAWS and NAWS Services\\n3341: \\n3342: > **_GOAL:_** By end of this lesson, you will understand how to distinguish and monitor your service's metrics across multiple AWS regions during migration.\\n3343: \\n3344: #### Define Your Service’s Region In Its Metrics\\n3345: {{warning}}\\n3346:  If you are migrating a MAWS service and utilizing Replicator, then Replicator will have completed this step for you. It’s important to still review this page to have an understanding of why and how your service is changing.\\n3347: {{/warning}}\\n3348: \\n3349: During your service’s migration from DUB (eu-west-1) to ZAZ (eu-south-2), your service will temporarily operate from both regions until 100% of your traffic is shifted to ZAZ. During this migration phase you will need to monitor your service in _both_ regions. Currently, your service’s metrics will not help distinguish which region they are originating from as this is not something that was previously required. By the end of this section, your service’s instances will be able to append their region to their metrics, helping you distinguish which region they are coming from.\\n3350: \\n3351: Without region-based metrics, it will not be possible to differentiate changes in latency or error rates between an existing instance of a service in DUB and a new instance of the same service in ZAZ as the metrics from both would appear as part of a single region-less service. While each instance is unique, the published metrics from all service instances are aggregated together without differentiation of where they are coming from, making it impossible to distinguish the metrics of one instance from another.\\n3352: \\n3353: To avoid breaking existing metrics and alarms in established regions, it's crucial to implement these changes only for new regions outside of DUB, IAD, and PDX. This approach ensures continuity for existing services while enabling region-specific monitoring for new deployments. Always test these changes thoroughly in a non-production environment before implementing them in production.\\n3354: \\n3355: #### MAWS\\n3356: \\n3357: When setting up monitoring for MAWS services, it is required you include the AWS Region of where your stack is deployed in the metrics each stack publishes. As part of region migration, if a metric can be emitted from more than one AWS Region, it is _required_ that the metric include the region of the environment of where it was created. By doing this, you can pinpoint exactly which region your service is facing issues in, easily compare data between stacks, and create tighter per-region alarms rather than larger cross-region ones. Please follow one of the approaches below in order to achieve this.\\n3358: \\n3359: * ***NOTE***: These changes should only be applied to new regions where your service will operate. Implementing these changes in your existing regions will break your current alarms and dashboards. \\n3360: \\n3361: \\n3362: #### NAWS\\n3363: \\n3364: When setting up monitoring for NAWS services publishing to CloudWatch, it's important to note that CloudWatch metrics include a region attribute by default. As part of multi-region deployment or migration, service owners should ensure they leverage this built-in region information when creating aggregated dashboards.\\n3365: \\n3366: It's important to remember that while CloudWatch automatically includes region information, adjusting how you view or aggregate these metrics in your dashboards may require updates to your existing monitoring setup. We recommend reviewing and potentially updating your dashboards and alarms to fully utilize the region-specific data available in CloudWatch, ensuring you maintain comprehensive visibility across all regions where your service operates. The approaches below are strictly for MAWS services. Please utilize CloudWatch in order to include your service's region in its metrics.\\n3367: \\n3368: \\n3369: #### How Do I Monitor Both of My Stacks?\\n3370: \\n3371: ##### A High-Level Overview of MetricAgent\\n3372: \\n3373: Although there are many different ways to publish metrics to MWS (see [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/PayStation_Routing_Authority_Service/PMET_vs_CW/#:~:text=box%20batching%20support.-,4.2.4%20Comparison%20between%20Agents%20in%20CloudWatch%3A,-Criteria)), the following example utilizes MetricAgent, which is the recommended choice by the Monitoring team for MAWS services.\\n3374: \\n3375: [MetricAgent](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/MonitoringTeam/MetricAgent/) is a tool that gathers metrics, [generated by Coral Metrics](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Coral/Metrics), from service logs. It then aggregates them and publishes them once a minute to CloudWatch and / or [Monitoring Web Service](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Monitoring/Documentation/MonitoringWebService/):\\n3376: \\n3377: ![Diagram](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/multi_region_metric_monitoring/metric_agent_overview_2.png)\\n3378: \\n3379: 1. A service can begin writing their metrics into a **QueryLogFile** (normally denoted **service_log** or **query_log**) through the usage of **Coral Metric Reporters**. Note that services are not required to use Coral in order to utilize the Coral Metrics library.\\n3380: 1. The written metrics are then read by MetricAgent from the **QueryLogFile** and published to MWS and/or CloudWatch.\\n3381: \\n3382: The approach below demonstrates how to integrate your service's region into an existing dimension of the service schema. Once added, MetricAgent can publish your service's metrics along with its region to Monitoring Web Services.\\n3383: \\n3384: ### If the marketplace field on your DUB metrics included \\\"EUAmazon\\\"\\n3385: \\n3386: **When using Apollo**: by updating the realm to be the full region name (e.g., eu-south-2) in your PubSub OpConfig as recommended elsewhere in this guidance, the marketplace field should automatically change to the region name (assuming you didn't have any particular overrides).\\n3387: \\n3388: **When using ApolloShim:** Use \\\"REPLACE_REGION\\\" in ApolloShim's PubSub OpConfig set.\\n3389: \\n3390: Additional documentation on Apollo Shim:\\n3391: \\n3392: * [apollo-shim.json documentation](https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/apollo/user-guide/howto-apollo-shim-for-code-deploy/#apollo-shim-json-documentation)\\n3393: * [ApolloShimOpConfigHelpers README.md](https://code.amazon.com/packages/ApolloShimOpConfigHelpers/blobs/mainline/--/README.md)\\n3394: \\n3395: \\n3396: \\n3397: ### If the marketplace field included more specific details, like the country code (e.g., \\\"DE\\\")\\n3398: \\n3399: In this case, you'll likely want to keep the marketplace field as-is and overload the DataSet dimension using Monitoring.TSD using the following steps. By the end of this section, your service will be appending its AWS Region, the region where your stack is running, to the DataSet dimension of its metrics.\\n3400: \\n3401: DataSet often lets service owners see which environment their metrics are coming from, sometimes including the stage. For example, the default value of DataSet is “Prod”, indicating that this metric is from the service’s Prod environment.\\n3402: \\n3403: Example:\\n3404: \\n3405: |BEFORE\\t|DataSet\\t|Marketplace\\t|HostGroup\\t|Host\\t|ServiceName\\t|MethodName\\t|Client\\t|MetricClass\\t|Instance\\t|Metric\\t|\\n3406: |---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|\\n3407: |\\t|Prod\\t|. . .\\t|ALL\\t|ALL\\t|RFEShellDiversMAWSLitmusService3\\t|ALL\\t|ALL\\t|NONE\\t|NONE\\t|Latency\\t|\\n3408: \\n3409: |AFTER\\t|DataSet\\t|Marketplace\\t|HostGroup\\t|Host\\t|ServiceName\\t|MethodName\\t|Client\\t|MetricClass\\t|Instance\\t|Metric\\t|\\n3410: |---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|\\n3411: |\\t|Prod:eu-south-2\\t|. . .\\t|ALL\\t|ALL\\t|RFEShellDiversMAWSLitmusService3\\t|ALL\\t|ALL\\t|NONE\\t|NONE\\t|Latency\\t|\\n3412: \\n3413: In the example above, DataSet includes \\\"eu-south-2\\\" which correctly reflects the AWS Region where the service runs. The DataSet dimension must always include your AWS Region, even if this information appears in other dimensions.\\n3414: \\n3415: * Marketplace is shown as \\\". . .\\\" since its value varies by team. For guidance on appropriate Marketplace values for your specific use case, please refer to our [Realm usage documentation](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Deep_Dives_and_Announcements/Deep_Dives/Realm_Recommendation/). TL:DR- your Marketplace in the new region should *not* be your service’s realm value (e.g. EUAmazon) unless switching it becomes too disruptive for your service.\\n3416: \\n3417: \\n3418: ##### Monitoring.TSD\\n3419: \\n3420: [Monitoring.TSD](https://apollo.amazon.com/operational_configuration.html?setId=371) is a set that can be added to your service’s Operational Configuration that allows you to directly modify the DataSet value that is published to MWS.\\n3421: \\n3422: ![OP Config Set](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/multi_region_metric_monitoring/op_config_set.png)\\n3423: \\n3424: \\n3425: This set has two attributes: **PerformanceStreamDestination** and **PerformanceStreamDataset**. By default, **PerformanceStreamDataset** will change your service’s Dataset value to \\\"**Prod\\\"** if this attribute’s value is \\\"**Default**\\\" and Monitoring.TSD is present in your service’s OpConfig. Changing this attribute’s value from \\\"**Default**\\\" will override your service’s DataSet with the custom value.\\n3426: \\n3427: For example, here **Monitoring.TSD : PerformanceStreamDataset’s** value is changed to “**Prod:eu-south-2**” and **PerformanceStreamDestination's** value is changed to \\\"zaz\\\":\\n3428: \\n3429: ![Monitor TSD](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/multi_region_metric_monitoring/monitoring_tsd_v2.png)\\n3430: \\n3431: After an active deployment, these changes are reflected on MWS:\\n3432: \\n3433: ![Example Metrics](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/multi_region_metric_monitoring/example_metrics.png)\\n3434: \\n3435: ##### How Do I Use Monitoring.TSD?\\n3436: \\n3437: 1. Navigate to your service’s Apollo environment.\\n3438: 1. On the right hand side under “*Environment Actions”*, click “*Edit environment operational configuration*.”\\n3439: 1. Search for \\\"[*Monitoring.TSD*](https://apollo.amazon.com/operational_configuration.html?setId=371)*\\\"* under \\\"*Sets Available*.\\\" Ensure you select \\\"*Monitoring.TSD*\\\" and not the other available monitoring sets.\\n3440: 1. Add the “*Monitoring.TSD*” Apollo operational configuration set to your environment.\\n3441: 1. Make “Monitoring.TSD : PerformanceStreamDataset” equal to your required “<Domain>:<AWS_Region>”, where *<Domain>* is your current Apollo environment’s Domain and *<AWS_Region>* is the AWS-region of where your stack is currently running. For example: “prod:eu-south-2”.\\n3442: 1. Change “Monitoring.TSD : PerformanceStreamDestination” to the new region where your service is operating from, \\\"zaz\\\" in this example. \\n3443: 1. Commit these changes.\\n3444: 1. Return to your service’s Apollo environment. On the right hand side under “*Edit Stage Properties”* , click “*Preview operational configuration*”*.*\\n3445: 1. Validate that your changes are committed in your operational configuration file (Highlighted yellow).\\n3446: 1. Once a deployment is executed, these changes will be applied. This can be done through a minimal deployment as well.\\n3447: \\n3448: This configuration changes the Dataset for all metrics in your environment to <Domain>:<AWS_Region> before sending them to Monitoring Web Services.  You can also differentiate your Beta, Alpha, and Gamma metrics by following the steps above but configuring each stage’s operational configuration instead of the *environment operation configuration*.\\n3449: \\n3450: \\n3451: ##### What If I Use MetricAgent Stream Configurations?\\n3452: \\n3453: You can check if your service utilizes MetricAgent stream configurations by checking its `$APOLLO_ENVIRONMENT_ROOT_DIRECTORY/monitoring/metricagent/` directory for any `.json` files.\\n3454: \\n3455: If your service is already using MetricAgent’s stream configurations to modify your Dataset, your stream configuration will be overridden by **Monitoring.TSD : PerformanceStreamDataset** if it is present and different from 'Default'.\\n3456: \\n3457: For example, say you have a stream configuration that is already modifying your metrics' Dataset and/or other fields:\\n3458: \\n3459: ```\\n3460:  {\\n3461:   \\\"Streams\\\" : [\\n3462:      {\\n3463:         \\\"monitorFileName\\\" : \\\"service_log\\\",\\n3464:         \\\"rotateMinutes\\\" : \\\"1440\\\",\\n3465:         \\\"seperator\\\" : \\\"EOE\\\",\\n3466:         \\\"schema\\\" : \\\"Service\\\"\\n3467:         \\\"dataset\\\" : \\\"Test:Prod\\\"\\n3468:      }\\n3469:   ]\\n3470:  }\\n3471: ```\\n3472: \\n3473: “**Test:Prod**” will be overridden with **Monitoring.TSD : PerformanceStreamDataset’s** custom value when your service’s metrics are pushed to MWS.\\n3474: \\n3475: \\n3476: #### FAQ\\n3477: \\n3478: ##### What Is Clashing Data?\\n3479: \\n3480: Monitoring Web Service does not support publishing the same metric from multiple regions. If your service publishes metrics to the same resource from two regions, the values you see on iGraph could be inaccurate and misleading. You may see values from either of the two regions; the same applies to your services’ alarms. When a particular metric is actively receiving data in multiple regions concurrently, it becomes [clashing data](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/ClashingData#What_is_.27Clashing_Data.27_.3F)— iGraph containing an incorrect view of the service’s metric data as it's unclear which region has the true metric:\\n3481: \\n3482: ![iGraph Example](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/multi_region_metric_monitoring/igraph_example.png)\\n3483: \\n3484: If your service has clashing data, please follow the recommended approach at the top. \\n3485: \\n3486: ## Module 10: Validate your service stack\\n3487: \\n3488: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this module, you will have conducted validations on your service in the target region.\\n3489: \\n3490: \\n3491: \\n3492: ### Lesson 10.1: Basic sanity testing\\n3493: \\n3494: You don't know if it works if you aren't trying it! This may require some test data set up. Make sure to validate the current production region as well as the new region.\\n3495: \\n3496: This part may be difficult depending on when you're doing it. Today, you cannot start your service up until all of your dependencies have updated their client config files, and you cannot trivially make cross-region calls ([BubbleBridge](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BubbleBridge/) requires per-service-pair onboarding), which causes a series of parallelization problems. And even once you call cross-region, your timeouts need to be updated as well. To help with all that, [Almanac](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Almanac/), [BigMesh Global Endpoints](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BigMesh_Global_Endpoints/), and a few others are working together to reduce this need for serialization to keep your work unblocked. But again, all of this is forward-looking and not ready yet.\\n3497: \\n3498: **Summary:** Test yourself! Make sure the service starts up, can be called by tests, and can call its dependencies.\\n3499: \\n3500: \\n3501: # Migration Milestone 2: Make your data accessible\\n3502: \\n3503: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this milestone, your service's data will be accessible in the target region.\\n3504: \\n3505: Assuming Migration Milestone 1: Set up your infrastructure has been performed successfully, by the end of Migration Milestone 2: Make your data accessible, your service will be able to handle traffic, although it may be slow.\\n3506: \\n3507: ## Module 11: Data accessibility\\n3508: \\n3509: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this module, your service's data will be accessible in the target region.\\n3510: \\n3511: Now that we set up our compute stacks, it's time for Data Migrations! **RFE** worked with **Engineering Excellence** to create this super cool course for you to walk you through the steps and information for Data Migration and Management.

Inertia from our old \\\"oracle days\\\", teams in SDO often expected values created transactionally exact with referential integrity and brought those expectations into their use of DDB, sometimes without careful consideration. So when you're considering your data migration strategy, looking at the transactional use of DDB or other products, it's important to re-frame the consideration around the customer use case and the API's user stories.\\n3526: \\n3527: Two examples, running in a single region today, and both using transactional exactness to make a data change.\\n3528: \\n3529: Changing the name of the customer - in this case, the CX implications of showing the wrong name for a few short seconds when data is replicated globally would be acceptable. Customers don't change their names often, and the impact to downstream systems is also likely acceptable. Therefore, using data systems like DDB global tables and accepting that values might be incorrect for a few seconds is a smart business trade-off to accelerate and _simplify_ the architecture. In this sort of use case, you can think of having caches and copies of the data replicated outward, and accepting the cache propagation delay in your user stories. Taking an example from a team who has already gotten into many new regions, Prime Video found that most of their systems could actually support the replication cost without customer impact.\\n3530: \\n3531: Debiting the balance of a gift-card balance on a customer account. - in this case, the business must have financial correctness so that customers cannot \\\"in-parallel\\\" debit the same balance multiple times. We all learned this use case (ATMs and banks) in our CS courses in college/high-school/textbooks/etc. So in this scenario the data must be modified from a single place, and replication cannot flow back and forth across the world, one single record must be correct and other systems must use that same record for their use cases. In this sort of use case, you must _move_ the record to the new location, and any copies or replicas must be kept in sync during the transactional modification or during any read of that record. One way or another (consistency-on-write or consistency-on-read) consistency is key to your use case.\\n3532: \\n3533: From the two examples above you can see two solutions for data access in new regions, namely eventual consistency of a replica, and transactional-exactness (again, either implemented as consistency on write, or consistency on read). In the first case, simply enabling Dynamo global tables creates a simple path for eventual consistency, but data movement, use of solutions like Hotwire (available today for Dynamo->Dynamo), and/or cross-region calls are _required_ for transactional exactness to be maintained as part of your use case.\\n3534: \\n3535: \\n3536: \\n3537: # Migration Milestone 3: Production readiness and incremental traffic shifting\\n3538: \\n3539: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this milestone, your service is taking traffic in target region.\\n3540: \\n3541: \\n3542: \\n3543: ## Module 12: Production readiness\\n3544: \\n3545: > **_GOAL:_** By end of this module, your service will be ready to get traffic in the destination region.\\n3546: \\n3547: \\n3548: \\n3549: ### Lesson 12.1: Define your alarms in your CDK pipeline and take a region parameter\\n3550: \\n3551: [Here](https://builderhub.corp.amazon.com/docs/native-aws/developer-guide/cdk-monitoring.html) is the Builderhub link to define your alarms. We copied over a couple common cases here.\\n3552: \\n3553: _Lambda_  \\n3554: When setting up monitoring for AWS Lambda function deployed with AWS CDK, you'll typically want to monitor metrics such as invocation count, errors, duration, and throttles. You can set up alarms to notify you if something goes wrong. As per BuilderHub recommendation, to monitor your service in Lambda today, you will likely want to use CloudWatch log scans.\\n3555: \\n3556: **Enable Logging for Lambda**  \\n3557: When you create a Lambda function, AWS automatically creates CloudWatch Logs log group for that function. By default, AWS Lambda writes logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs in the log group that corresponds to the Lambda function. Ensure that your Lambda function has the necessary IAM permissions to write logs. The AWS managed policy ‘AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole’ provides the permissions that the function needs to write logs to CloudWatch Logs.\\n3558: \\n3559: **Query Logs with CloudWatch logs insights**\\n3560: \\n3561: 1. Open the CloudWatch Console\\n3562: 1. In the navigation pane, choose **\\\"Logs\\\"** then choose **\\\"Log groups\\\"** \\n3563: 1. Select the log group for your Lambda function. By default, this is **\\\"/aws/lambda/<function-name>**\\\".\\n3564: 1. Choose **\\\"Log Insights\\\"** tab\\n3565: 1. In the query editor, write your own queries\\n3566: \\n3567: **Automating your queries**\\n3568: \\n3569: 1. To automate the monitoring and create alerts based on specific log patterns, you can\\n3570:     1. Write a scheduled Lambda function that runs CloudWatch Log Insights queries using **\\\"StartQuery\\\"** API.\\n3571:     1. Use the query results to determine if an alert should be sent.\\n3572: 1. If an alert condition is met, have the Lambda function send notifications (i.e. via SNS topic)\\n3573: \\n3574: **Create metric filters to alarm based on your automated queries**\\n3575: \\n3576: 1. In the CloudWatch console, go to **‘logs’**  and select the log group for your Lambda function.\\n3577: 1. Choose **‘Create metric filter’** \\n3578: 1. Define a pattern to match (timestamp = XX, request_id = “ERROR” etc)\\n3579: 1. Assign the metric a name and value\\n3580: 1. Set the filter to monitor the occurrence of the pattern and to increment the metric\\n3581: 1. Once the filter is created, you can create an alarm on the new custom metric.\\n3582: 1. Define the alarm threshold and action based on the metric. (i.e. Sev-2 range, Sev-1 range, Sev-3 range)\\n3583: \\n3584: Example:  \\n3585: ![1705364138382-368.png](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/define_your_alarms_in_your_cdk_pipeline_and_take_a_region_parameter/1705364138382-368.png)\\n3586: \\n3587: _EC2_  \\n3588: For instance monitoring, BuilderHub recommends using the CloudWatch Agent to push instance metrics to CloudWatch. The sample application wires the most basic metrics for you that you can customize later. \\n3589: \\n3590: 1. Follow the instructions to get the metrics agent up and running on ECE. This will allow EC2 to publish to both PMET and CloudWatch. \\n3591:    * If your ZAZ/FRA environment is in an AWS account created after July 29 2024, follow Monitor Webservice’s [onboarding guide](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/MonitoringWebService/Docs/MWSAuthorization/OnboardingGuide/#HIhaveanewaccountinNAWSandusingMetricAgenttopublishmetrics.WhatistheminimumchangeIneed3F) to provision compute-level fine grain permission for PMET metric publishing, otherwise your metrics will not be published.\\n3592: 1. Metrics that you want to use for EC2 autoscaling must go to CloudWatch Metrics.\\n3593: 1. After your CloudWatch Agent is configured and running on your EC2 instance, you can define CloudWatch alarms for specific metrics in your CDK stack. \\n3594: 1. Deploy the CDK Stack to AWS.\\n3595: 1. After your stack is deployed, your EC2 instance should be reporting metrics to CloudWatch, and your alarms will be active to notify. You if the specific thresholds are breached.  \\n3596: Note: Make sure the IAM Role associated with the EC2 instance has the necessary permissions to interact with CloudWatch (put metrics, logs, etc).\\n3597: \\n3598: ### Lesson 12.2: Regional Endpoint Configuration Readiness Checklist\\n3599: \\n3600: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this lesson, you should be able to attest that your pipeline is ready for production traffic.\\n3601: \\n3602: **Goal:** Check your service's is ready to receive traffic in the new region. Note that this checklist covers common cases and supplements your service's existing Operational Readiness Review (ORR) or similar processes, not replace them. The goal of this lesson is to confirm that your service is “Ready for Traffic Shifting”.\\n3603: \\n3604: > !NOTE:  Complete the **LRA Configuration** section **only if** you onboarded to LRA as part of **Lesson 1.1: Onboard your callee service to LRA**. \\n3605: \\n3606: ### **LRA Configuration:** Check your LRA endpoint is working<br>\\n3607: 1. **End-to-End Request (Recommended)**<br>\\n3608:     1. Validate your LRA endpoint configuration by performing an end-to-end request test across all configured regions. This can be done either manually or through integration testing. A successful response and confirmation that it has reached the expected regional endpoint validates that your LRA endpoint is properly configured.\\n3609:         * If you lack the necessary infrastructure for end-to-end testing, you can use the alternative verification methods described below. However, please note that end-to-end testing remains the most reliable method for ensuring your LRA endpoint is functioning as intended.\\n3610: 2. **LRA Target Region Request**<br>\\n3611:     1. Check your LRA is configured to send requests in the target region to your new endpoint in the target region (e.g. ZAZ → ZAZ). Follow these steps to perform the verification:\\n3612:         1. Execute: `mechanic ex lra tool describe-configuration --endpoint=<Your-Lra-Endpoint> --region pdx-prod`\\n3613:         2. Verify that that your `eu-south-2` (ZAZ) caller region is configured to your ZAZ regional endpoint.\\n3614:         3. Update your LRA endpoint to resolve to your new endpoint in the target region (e.g. foo.zaz.amazon) if your LRA endpoint is missing configurations for the target region (e.g `eu-south-2`) or is configured to resolve to your endpoint in the source region. You can perform this using [TSA](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/TSA/Guide-to-update-LRA-endpoint-resolution-on-TSA). If you are certain your service does not have callers in the target region you can do this via LRA CLI `update-configuration`. More information [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/LRA/FAQs#HImadeamistakewhencreatingmyLRAendpoint2CbutI2019msurethatnobodyisusingityet.HowcanIfixit3F).\\n3615:   3. **Alternative Verification Methods**<br>\\n3616:         1. Certificate Verification: To verify your certificates, you'll need to perform a TLS handshake with your LRA Endpoint in each configured region. This verification must be conducted from a host that has connectivity to your services and is located in a region where your LRA endpoint is configured. Follow these steps to perform the verification:<br>\\n3617:             1. If your LRA endpoint is `prod.foo.lra.amazon` and it's configured to direct `eu-south-2` clients to `foo.dub.amazon.com`, you would need to execute the verification command from a host in `eu-south-2`. This verification can be performed using a CURL command with your LRA endpoint:\\n3618:                 1. Execute: `curl https://<LRA Endpoint>:<HTTPS Port>/sping`\\n3619:             2. After running this command, confirm that it returns Healthy from hosts in **ALL** regions where your LRA endpoint is configured. This confirmation ensures that your certificate verification is successful and your endpoints are properly configured in each region.\\n3620:         2. DNS check: To perform a health check on the LRA endpoint for all configured regions, follow these steps:<br>\\n3621:             * The following health check command performs a DNS check to confirm the LRA endpoint resolves to the regional endpoint configured for the caller region; verifying that all the regions are `Healthy`. For more details on health check refer to this [FAQ](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/LRA/FAQs#HVerificationMethods).<br>\\n3622:             * Execute: `mechanic ex lra health check --region pdx-prod --endpoint <Your LRA endpoint>` <br>\\n3623:             * ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/regional_endpoint_readiness_checklist/DNS_Check-LRA-Resolve.png)\\n3624: \\n3625:         3. AAA Configuration: Check your LRA endpoint is added to your AAA application. Follow these steps to perform the verification:<br>\\n3626:             1. Visit the [ServiceLens](https://servicelens.jumpstart.amazon.dev/#/) website.<br>\\n3627:             2. Select \\\"My Applications\\\" (on the top right side) and select the application your service exists.<br>\\n3628:             3. Select the \\\"Services\\\" tab select your service.<br>\\n3629:             4. Select \\\"EndPoints\\\" tab.<br>\\n3630:             5. Verify that LRA endpoint is added in the correct format ending with `*.lra.amazon` **NOT** `*.lra.amazon.com` <br>\\n3631:                 * ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/regional_endpoint_readiness_checklist/AAA_Verify-LRA-Endpoint.png)\\n3632:             6. Skip the following steps if your LRA Endpoint is already listed in your Service Endpoint table. These instructions are only necessary if you need to add your LRA Endpoint to your Service Endpoint configuration.\\n3633:                 1. Click on add endpoint\\n3634:                 2. Select \\\"Manually Enter Endpoints\\\" from the pop-up window opened.\\n3635:                 3. Perform the following actions for each LRA endpoint determined in Step 1:\\n3636:                     1. Select \\\"Default - Any region except for China\\\" for the security region.\\n3637:                     2. Enter the LRA endpoint to add, prefixed with https:// and Click \\\"Add\\\" button\\n3638:                     3. Repeat this for your services other LRA endpoints.\\n3639:                     4. Complete the action after adding all the LRA endpoints by clicking \\\"Add Endpoints\\\".\\n3640:             \\n3641: ### **Verify your service has properly set up Connectivity Tools:** \\n3642: Verify you have set up connectivity for your service by ensuring you have your new region's regional endpoint (`foo.zaz.amazon.com`) have properly onboarded to connectivity tools like SuperStar. This step only verify your service has properly set up connectivity but to properly test connectivity would require an end-to-end request. **!Note:** LRA endpoint (foo.**lra.amazon**) must not be on SuperStar endpoints. Super-Star will add a safe-guard to prevent adding  *.lra.amazon endpoints; but until then you need to verify the LRA endpoint was not added to SuperStar.\\n3643: 1. Verify by revisiting the **Lesson 1.3: Setup Cross-Region Connectivity** to confirm all pipelines for your service have the Registered status. Since infrastructure changes may have occurred since your initial setup, this verification step ensures your pipelines in your service remain properly onboarded.<br>\\n3644: ![Registered](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/regional_endpoint_readiness_checklist/VerifyConnectivity_Lesson-1_3-Regisered.png)<br>\\n3645: 2. Action any pipelines from your service that are `Not Registered`, follow the `Suggested Action` to onboard to the suggested connectivity tool for the pipeline. This process may take **up to 24 hours** to reflect as `Registered` once you have perform the suggested actions properly.<br>\\n3646: ![Not Registered](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/regional_endpoint_readiness_checklist/VerifyConnectivity_Lesson-1_3-NotRegisered.png)<br>\\n3647: 3. For cases of `No Data` follow the same procedure to perform the `Suggested Action` however since the connectivity tool may not have enough data on the pipeline it may not appear in the `Registered` tabs even after properly performing the suggested actions.<br>\\n3648: ![No Data](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/regional_endpoint_readiness_checklist/VerifyConnectivity_Lesson-1_3-NoData.png)<br>\\n3649: \\n3650: ### **Check that alarms has been configured for the New Region**\\n3651: 1. Please review **Lesson 12.1: Define your alarms in your CDK pipeline and take a region parameter** to verify that you have properly set up alarms in the new region. This setup should include setting up appropriate CloudWatch alarms and comprehensive monitoring dashboards tailored to your service needs. This ensures comprehensive visibility into your service's performance and health in the new region. \\n3652: \\n3653: \\n3654: \\n3655: ### Lesson 12.3: Readying your pipeline for production\\n3656: \\n3657: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this lesson your service should be ready for production deployment.\\n3658: \\n3659: Once your service is ready for production traffic, you’ll want to make sure associated pipeline stages are labeled as production in your pipeline. This will 1) remove the short-circuiting in place with [Accelerated Releases](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CraneCD/AcceleratedReleases/StoresRegional/) to deploy to your production stages “as usual”, and 2) will ensure appropriate Dogma rules are applied to your new region stage. This can be done by hand (In Pipelines, Edit then “make this stage prod”), via LPT ([example](https://code.amazon.com/packages/AIDICEPredictorBaseLpt/blobs/0edb638c4d39d90e43e4b1544ed854750875d59e/--/lib/amazon/lpt/templates/aidicepredictor_lpt_base.rb#L177-L179)), or via CDK ([example](https://code.amazon.com/packages/PipelineBestPracticeEnforcementCDK/blobs/a6770f880386b21afe94411b5860ffde6c5cf4ca/--/lib/appFactory.ts#L60)). This needs to be done BEFORE you receive production traffic to your new stage(s).\\n3660: \\n3661: | If my current pipeline... | Then my new stages for ZAZ nd FRA should... |\\n3662: |:----- | :----- |\\n3663: | Is using Accelerated Releases.<br /><br />This can be verified by following Edit -> Manage Accelerated Releases and checking if any boxes are checked. | Be ready to go! |\\n3664: | Has the new region at the start of the piepline, or in a place other than where I want it in my production flow. | Be moved to match the pipeline's standard deployment practices. E.g. they should be in new pipeline stages next to DUB if your pipeline currently deploys to one region at a time.|\\n3665: \\n3666: ## Module 13: Traffic Shifting\\n3667: \\n3668: > **_GOAL:_** By end of this module, you will learn about the traffic shifting process and the related terms, and if your service is not part of a sub-experience, you will have shifted your endpoint traffic from DUB to ZAZ.\\n3669: \\n3670: Traffic shifting is the step in which you move customer traffic from one endpoint to another. This is a high judgment and critical task, and like any other production change, it must be completed with safe-guards such as MCM, and 2P reviews. This guidance provides you with different options, safe-guards and known risks; however, review your actual traffic shifting steps with your tech lead and manager.\\n3671: \\n3672: Traffic shifting is performed by the builder of a *callee* service's to shift requests from its *caller service(s)* between the callee service's different regional endpoints. In this guide we call the endpoint the requests are shifted from, the *source endpoint*, and the endpoint requests are shifted to, the *destination endpoint*.\\n3673: \\n3674: ![Traffic Shifting](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/traffic_switching/CnP_26112024_135646.png)\\n3675: \\n3676: {{error}}\\n3677:  Before migrating traffic or experimenting in the target region, estimate your cross-region network bandwidth usage from source to target region route and vice versa. If the max utilization during peak days is greater than 1Gbps for either route you must follow the [approval process](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Migration_Issues_Tracker/DUB-ZAZ_NetworkUsageApprovalProcess/) for bandwidth allocation.\\n3678: {{/error}}\\n3679: \\n3680: ### Lesson 13.1: Should you shift your traffic?\\n3681: \\n3682: > **_GOAL:_** By end of this lesson, you will decide if you should proceed with the Traffic Shifting module.\\n3683: \\n3684: For reasons such as latency, some services must exit DUB together in group migrations where multiple services migrate with each other. The group is called a sub-experience in RFE's [strategy](https://wiki.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Deep_Dives_and_Announcements/Announcements/Exit_DUB_Strategy/). If your service is part of a sub-experience you must not shift your service's traffic unless it is instructed by the [sub-experience](https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/subExperiences)'s Migration Coordinator, MC. For most sub-experiences the traffic shifting happens where customer requests enter Amazon's network (Network Edge). The red arrows in the diagram below show where the traffic shifting happens for individual services and sub-experiences.\\n3685: \\n3686: ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/should_you_shift_your_traffic/CnP_26112024_141220._CB540346123_.png)\\n3687: \\n3688: You can find the sub-experiences your service is part of on the Migration Plan Overview page of the current migration plan per screenshot below.\\n3689: \\n3690: ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/should_you_shift_your_traffic/CnP_26112024_142647.png)\\n3691: \\n3692: If your service is included in a sub-experience that it is not part of, contact the sub-experience's Migration Coordinator to remove your service. The sub-experience Migration Coordinator can be found on the [Sub-experience Migration Plans](https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/subExperiences).\\n3693: \\n3694: ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/should_you_shift_your_traffic/CnP_26112024_142737.png)\\n3695: \\n3696: {{info}}\\n3697:  If you don’t have to shift the traffic of your service because your service is part of a sub-experience, please mark this lesson and the other lessons under the Traffic Shifting Module as completed with no further actions. \\n3698: {{/info}}\\n3699: \\n3700: ### Lesson 13.2: Traffic Shifting Strategy\\n3701: \\n3702: > **_GOAL:_** By end of this lesson, you will understand the distinct traffic sources along with traffic shifting tools that are best suited for your service and create a traffic shifting strategy.\\n3703: \\n3704: ## Overview\\n3705: \\n3706: The final step of this migration process involves gradually shifting the live user traffic from the source region to the newly deployed infrastructure in the target region. This needs to be done in a controlled manner to ensure a seamless transition without disrupting the application's availability or introducing any connectivity or latency issues for the end-users.\\n3707: \\n3708: 1.  Implement a mechanism to gradually redirect a specified percentage of the live traffic from the source region to the target region, while monitoring the application's performance and user experience.\\n3709: 2.  Ensure that the redirected traffic is not impacting any service performance and availability metrics, specially the latency experienced by the users is within acceptable limits.\\n3710: 3.  Provide a rollback plan in case any issues are encountered during the traffic redirection process, to quickly revert the traffic back to the source region.\\n3711: 4.  Ensure a seamless transition for the end-users, with minimal to no disruption in the application's availability and user experience.\\n3712: \\n3713: ## Identifying traffic Sources\\n3714: \\n3715: Before implementing a traffic shift between regions, it's crucial to identify all distinct traffic sources to your service. Various clients may be accessing your service through different paths, making comprehensive source discovery essential for a successful migration. To assist in this process, we'll outline key methods and tools for discovering traffic sources. Once you've mapped all incoming traffic patterns, you can effectively utilize the appropriate shifting tools (detailed in subsequent sections) to execute the migration. This systematic approach ensures no traffic sources are overlooked during the transition process.\\n3716: \\n3717: ### AXON\\n3718: \\n3719: **Link**: <https://axon.ops.amazon.dev/service-graph/>\\n3720: The Axon tool provides a primary method for discovering traffic sources by analyzing callee and caller services when given an environment name. This tool specifically helps identify clients sending traffic to your service. However, it's important to note that some endpoints may not be scanned by AXON. To leverage AXON , verify that your service has successfully completed Convoy onboarding, as AXON is bundled with Convoy.\\n3721: \\n3722: ### Code repository\\n3723: \\n3724: **Link:** [code.amazon.com](http://code.amazon.com)\\n3725: Code repository analysis serves as another method for traffic source discovery. By traversing the Amazon code repository for specific endpoints, you can identify services that are sending traffic to your application. This approach is particularly useful for finding client instances defined within service packages that might not be immediately visible through other tools.\\n3726: \\n3727: ### M2X\\n3728: \\n3729: **Link:** <https://console.m2x.amazon.dev/pipeline-details/61405>\\n3730: \\n3731: M2X, typically used for data migration, offers another avenue for traffic source identification. When provided with a pipeline, it can map upstream and downstream pipeline connections, revealing client traffic patterns. However, be aware that clients sending traffic without an established pipeline may not appear in M2X analysis results.\\n3732: \\n3733: ### I-Graph metrics via Monitor Portal\\n3734: \\n3735: **Link**: <https://monitorportal.amazon.com/igraph>\\n3736: IGraph metrics provide a comprehensive view of traffic patterns. Since each client interaction generates metrics, analyzing IGraph data allows you to identify distinct clients and their corresponding traffic methods. This approach offers a data-driven perspective on traffic patterns and helps validate findings from other discovery methods.\\n3737: \\n3738: **Recommendation:**\\n3739: Given that each service architecture is unique, it's crucial to utilize multiple discovery methods rather than relying on a single approach. This comprehensive strategy ensures complete coverage of all traffic sources, as missing even a single client could result in residual traffic in the source region after migration. We recommend implementing a combination of these tools based on your service's specific requirements to achieve complete traffic source discovery.\\n3740: \\n3741: ## Traffic Shifting Tools\\n3742: Depending on your service's availability SLAs and the type of services that call your service, you can choose from different traffic shifting tools:\\n3743: \\n3744: 1.  **DNS:** You can configure the DNS for your existing endpoint (e.g. DUB endpoint) to resolve to your new endpoint (e.g. ZAZ endpoint). For example you can update the A records for your service endpoint in DUB, `foo.dub.amazon.com`, to return the IP address of your service endpoint in ZAZ, `foo.zaz.amazon.com`. This is called a *DNS flip* and will eventually take effect depending on the Time To Live (TTL) of your DNS record. You can also use Route 53 to gradually change the DNS resolutions for your endpoint. This is called *Weighted DNS Traffic Shifting.* To learn more, *s*ee [Prime Video's DNS traffic shifting guidance](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AV_Operational_Excellence/NativeAWS/Guidance/DNSTrafficMigration/).\\n3745: 2.  **Weblab:** [Weblab](https://weblab.amazon.com/) is SDO's tool for running experiments. With Weblab, you create an experiment on Weblab's UI. Your service's callers need to be configured to send the request to your different endpoints based on their Weblab treatment. When using Weblab you send the control (C) to the source endpoint and the treatments (T1, T2, etc) to the destination endpoint. Traffic shifting with Weblab requires you to coordinate code changes on your callers. However, some callers such as Shopping Portal and Online Proxy Fleet (OPF) have integrated with Weblab and you can shift incoming requests from them without code changes. We will look into identifying your service's callers in the next section. Additional Shopping Portal and OPF resources:\\n3746: \\n3747:     1.  Shopping Portal: <https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/ShoppingPortal/AwayTeamModel/CEWeblabguidelines/>\\n3748:     2.  Shopping Portal example: [Weblab and JumpStart Guidance for Traffic Shifting to New Region](https://quip-amazon.com/FFEMA5k57Vzz)\\n3749:     3.  OPF non-retail: <https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/OPF/Operations/SelfService/OPFWeblab/>\\n3750:     4.  OPF retail: Most retail services behind OPF are fronted by Shopping Portal and can utilize Shopping Portal's Weblab.(OPF→Shopping Portal → Service). If your service is one of the rare retail services that is called directly by OPF consider this option: <https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/SwitchNextGen/ServiceMigration>\\n3751: \\n3752: 4.  **Traffic Shifting Accelerator, TSA:** Sits between DNS and Weblab in terms of builder effort, gradual shifting and monitoring. TSA is integrated with RFP and you can perform TSA traffic shifts as part of your RFP Service Migration Plan - please find the **Traffic Shifting Accelerator** under the current migration module. TSA shifts requests on caller services by intercepting and overriding the endpoint for the requests before they are sent to your service endpoint. To do this, the caller service needs to be integrated with TSA. The requests from integrated callers are called *TSA shiftable traffic*. You can see how many of your service's incoming requests are shiftable [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/TSA/ShiftableTraffic/). You can overlay the shiftable metric with your service metric to see what portion of your requests are TSA shiftable. Learn more about shifting traffic with TSA [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/TSA).\\n3753: \\n3754: You can see how these tools compare in [this wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/TSA/ToolsComparison/). In summary TSA fills the gap between DNS's lower builder effort and Weblab's monitoring, impact detection and rollback.\\n3755: \\n3756: **Builder effort (Best → Better)**\\n3757: \\n3758: DNS → TSA → Weblab\\n3759: \\n3760: \\n3761: **Monitoring, impact detection and rollback (Best → Better)**\\n3762: \\n3763: Weblab → TSA → DNS\\n3764: \\n3765: \\n3766: **Preventing failures when the caller cannot connect to the callee (Best → Better)**\\n3767: \\n3768: TSA → Weblab → DNS\\n3769: \\n3770: \\n3771: **Traffic Shifting Strategy:** We create a traffic shifting strategy based on your service and services that call it. The strategy generally uses one or more of the traffic shifting tools following these guidelines:\\n3772: \\n3773: -   **The perfect tool does not exist:** Amazon has broad and rich variation across services and hence it is unlikely that a tool works for all use-cases and variations. We will not let this block us; this means we may choose a tool that covers a portion of the traffic or use multiple tools for a single endpoint.\\n3774: -   **The initial portion of the shift is the riskiest:** Usually the first few percentage of the traffic shift is the most risky, because the new endpoint will start to receive production traffic. Start with tools that have better control over request selection and select smaller initial steps e.g. 0.1% → 1% → 2% → 5% → 10% → 20% → 40% → 60% → 80% → 100%.\\n3775: -   **Move fast when it is safe:** Traffic shifting is a high judgement process and the service owners need to find the right balance between bias for action and insist on highest standards. For example, you can move faster for a service that can sustain 1-2 hours of outage without impacting customers, compared to a service that will immediately impact customers during an outage.\\n3776: -   **You are not alone:** Many teams across SDO are going through this process, so you can learn from their learnings or share yours. If you have not already done so, please join the #region-flex-2024 slack channel and seach for Traffic Shifting in the channel.\\n3777: -   **Careful with DNS flips:** Do not use DNS flip unless your service can sustain a 1-2 hour outage. If none of the other tools work for your service, use weighted DNS shifts.\\n3778: \\n3779: For the strategy we follow the following decision tree, our goal is to shift as much as the traffic as possible, as safely, and as fast as possible.\\n3780: \\n3781: ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/choose_a_traffic_shifting_mechanism/CnP_26112024_144550.png)\\n3782: \\n3783: As shown in the diagram, depending on which services call your service, you may have to use multiple tools for a single endpoint. Having an exact list of callers is not a pre-requisite for traffic shifting unless you exclusively want to use Weblab for your traffic shifting. If you are not sure who the callers of your service are, you can try the following:\\n3784: \\n3785: * Use [Axon](https://axon.ops.amazon.dev/service-graph) by selecting your service's Apollo or SuperStar Environment to see your callers (on the left). Please note that some of your callers may not be shown on Axon, however, Axon is integrated with OPF and Shopping Portal and if your service is onboarded to Axon you can tell if either of those services call you. If you cannot find your service on Axon, onboard to Axon [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Axon/Development/Onboarding/Agent).\\n3786: \\n3787: ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/choose_a_traffic_shifting_mechanism/CnP_26112024_144653.png)\\n3788: \\n3789: -   If your service is using [AAA](https://aaa.amazon.com/dashboard), you can use AAA relationships to find your service's callers.\\n3790: -   Search your endpoint FQDN or client-configuration package on [code.amazon.com](https://code.amazon.com) to find the callers that depend on your service. Once you find the packages you can find the version-sets that consume the package and their respective pipelines.\\n3791: -   Ask your team lead or engineers that have a longer tenure on the team.\\n3792: \\n3793: Aside from the tools you use for shifting traffic, you need to verify when the traffic shifting is complete. A traffic shift is only complete when the source endpoint no longer receive requests. Note that some requests such as [load-balancer health checks](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Load_Balancers/Health_Checks/) may continue to persist after all customer traffic is shifted. Health-checks are usually a constant trend and do not follow the around clock cycle. The best way to verify all customer requests are shifted is by looking at your per-API metrics and service logs. Depending on your service's traffic patterns you may have to look back a few weeks or months on the metrics. For example if your service only receives requests over the weekends you need to verify the service has not received any requests for at least one weekend since the traffic shift was executed.\\n3794: \\n3795: Below is an example a traffic shifting strategy. \\n3796: \\n3797: | Order | Step | Coverage | Steps | Rollback |\\n3798: | --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |\\n3799: | 1 | Shift TSA shiftable traffic | ~30% of total traffic | 0.1% → 1% → 2% → 5% → 10% → 20% → 50% → 100% | set TSA dialup to the previous percentage. |\\n3800: | 2 | Shift traffic from Shopping Portal | ~20% of total traffic | 1% → 5% → 10% → 20% → 50% → 100% | set Weblab treatment to the previous percentage. |\\n3801: | 3 | Shift traffic from top-talker service Foo by adding Weblab to Foo | ~15% of total traffic | 1% → 5% → 10% → 20% → 50% → 100% | set Weblab treatment to the previous percentage. |\\n3802: | 4 | Shift the rest of the traffic using weighted DNS | ~35% of total traffic | 1% → 5% → 10% → 20% → 50% → 100% | set Route53 weight to the previous percentage. |\\n3803: | 5 | Verify traffic shift is complete | N/A | check source endpoint metrics and service logs | N/A |\\n3804: \\n3805: ### Lesson 13.3: Prepare for the Traffic Shift\\n3806: \\n3807: > **_GOAL:_** By end of this lesson, you will have created the MCM(s) that will be used to perform the traffic shifting, have updated your dashboards and alarms to be ready for the traffic shifting and have tested the traffic shifting tool you are using against your pre-prod endpoints.\\n3808: \\n3809: **MCM:** Like any other manual production change, production traffic shifts must be conducted under an [MCM](https://mcm.amazon.com/). MCMs are a mechanism to lay out the steps of the traffic shifting strategy, monitoring, rollback steps, and performing reviews with and receiving approvals from your team lead and manager. Furthermore, MCM provides visibility to [CTOS](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CTOS/), allows you to handover the execution to another person if needed, and preserves the history for [COEs](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/COE) if something goes wrong. You can find Shopping Portal's Weblab dial up [template](https://mcm.amazon.com/templates/TM-107650) here and ReBalance program's example MCMs for DNS traffic shifting [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/ReBalance/Runbooks/Dashboards/Index). When creating the MCM you must include your team's on-call, manager and tech-lead as a reviewer.\\n3810: \\n3811: If your service is part of a sub-experience and the Migration Coordinator (MC) has asked you to shifting the traffic you must also add the MC as a reviewer. If your service has a few (5 or less) major callers, it's best practice to include them on the MCM.\\n3812: \\n3813: You should inform your callers when executing a traffic shift because some errors may be visible on their dashboards but not yours. If you have 100s of callers and do not have a mechanism(e.g email list) to inform them, you should inform your top-5-talker callers by adding them to the MCM as reviewers.\\n3814: \\n3815: **Dashboards and Alarms:** You may have to update your service alarms and dashboards for migrations. This is especially important if your service publishes metrics to [PMET](https://monitorportal.amazon.com/) using [MetricAgent](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/MonitoringTeam/MetricAgent/). PMET metrics are regional, i.e. if metrics with the same attributes are sent to multiple PMET regional endpoints, the metrics are not aggregated on PMET and your dashboard or alarms may not work as expected. If this happens, PMET adds a \\\"Clashing data detected\\\" warning. You need to fix this by following the Lesson 9.5: Multi-Region Metric Monitoring in MAWS and NAWS Services.\\n3816:   * If your ZAZ/FRA environment is in an AWS account created after July 29 2024, follow Monitor Webservice’s [onboarding guide](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/MonitoringWebService/Docs/MWSAuthorization/OnboardingGuide/#HIhaveanewaccountinNAWSandusingMetricAgenttopublishmetrics.WhatistheminimumchangeIneed3F) to provision compute-level fine grain permission for PMET metric publishing, otherwise your metrics will not be published.\\n3817: \\n3818: \\n3819: ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/create_an_mcm_for_your_traffic_shifting_plan/CnP_26112024_152653.png)\\n3820: \\n3821: As a temporary workaround and to see which region the clashing data is coming from, you can add the **ShowLocations=true** attribute to the metric on [iGraph](https://monitorportal.amazon.com/igraph). The clashing data warning disappears automatically after some time when there are no clashing data (the exact time depends on the period of the graph). Note that the ShowLocations=true attribute is not saved on iGraph urls and if you share the iGraph url with someone they need to add it too. See this [wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/ClashingData/) for more information.\\n3822: \\n3823: ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/create_an_mcm_for_your_traffic_shifting_plan/CnP_26112024_152931.png)\\n3824: \\n3825: **Pre-production testing:** If you are using a tool for the first time for the traffic shift, for example if this is the first time you are using Weblab or TSA, you should first use the tool on your pre-production endpoints.\\n3826: \\n3827: ### Lesson 13.4: Execute the Traffic Shifting Strategy\\n3828: \\n3829: > **_GOAL:_** By end of this lesson, you will have completed the traffic shifting of your service by executing the MCM(s).\\n3830: \\n3831: This is the most impactful step of the traffic shifting process. During this lesson you execute the MCM from the previous lesson. At this point, we assume your destination endpoint is ready to receive customer traffic and is scaled to handle requests. If your service is not ready or not scaled to receive traffic go back to the Production Readiness module.\\n3832: During your service's traffic shift the most important thing is to detect potential issues as soon as possible and use judgement to decide whether you should rollback, pause, or continue. Your traffic shifting may impact your callers or the services your service calls in a way that is not visible on your dashboard. For example, your service's latency may be higher in the destination region, which could result in timeouts on your service's callers. Before you begin executing the traffic shift make sure:\\n3833: \\n3834: 1.  All the MCM activities have rollback steps that you are comfortable executing. If not, add rollback steps or ask for help from your manager.\\n3835: 2.  You know how to ask for help if something goes wrong. If you don't, talk to your manager and team lead before starting.\\n3836: 3.  If your service is tier-1 or can have customer impact during outages you can register your traffic shift as a large scale event on <https://lse.amazon.com/>. It is a good practice to include adding the LSE as a step in your MCM and removing it at the end.\\n3837: 4.  If something goes wrong:\\n3838: \\n3839:     1.  Stay calm, and make decisions based on your knowledge of your service and the monitoring data. During traffic shifts rolling back may not always be the best option. If you decide to rollback it is important to decide how far you want to rollback to and that the source endpoint has capacity to serve the requests that will be rolled back. This should already be included in the MCM rollback steps. But keep this in mind especially during the final stages of the dial up where most of the traffic is moved to the destination endpoint. If you need help making decisions engage your manager. Engage [CTOS](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CTOS/) if there is widespread customer impact beyond your service and you need help making decisions.\\n3840:     2.  Make sure the impact is reported on the MCM or ongoing tickets. It is important to capture metrics and logs for root-causing the issues for the next iteration.\\n3841: \\n3842: 5.  During traffic shifts, at the minimum you should monitor the following:\\n3843: \\n3844:     1.  **Total request count:** the total number of requests, i.e. the sum of requests across the sources and destination endpoints, should follow your service's normal request count trend during the traffic shift. If your metric is on PMET you can use day over day or week over week overlays to check this. If you see a change in the number of requests then you need to investigate. Sometimes special events such as sport events or natural disasters result in divergence from the normal trend.\\n3845: \\n3846:     ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rfe-albus/migration_guidance_static_content/dialing_up_traffic_to_your_new_regional_service_stack/CnP_26112024_160407.png)\\n3847:     \\n3848:     2.  **Error/Failures:** The percentage of errors or failures, that is the number of errors or failures divided by the total request count, should remain the same during the migration across the source and destination endpoint. If you see a change you need to investigate. For example, 5% errors on your source endpoint and 20% errors on the destination needs to be investigated. If you see errors that are out of normal bounds for your service, it needs to be investigated. \\n3849:     3.  **Latency:** If your service depends on other services, latency may be different before and after the traffic shift depending on where your dependencies are. As a rule of thumb, a return cross region call in EU region costs 60-70ms on average. When looking at latency it is important to look at the correct histogram distribution; most teams at Amazon look at P50, P90, and P99. Higher latency on your service in the destination endpoint can result in timeouts on services that call your service. For more information on timeouts refer to Module 8: Prepare for your service for cross-region latency.\\n3850: \\n3851: You are now ready to execute the traffic shifting strategy via MCM. [Reference MCM template](https://mcm.amazon.com/templates/TM-137516) Proceed to the next lesson once the MCM execution is complete.\\n3852: \\n3853: ### Lesson 13.5: Make the Traffic Shift Permanent\\n3854: \\n3855: > **_GOAL:_** By end of this lesson, you will make the traffic shift permanent for your service and cleanup the temporary resources.\\n3856: \\n3857: As mentioned in the previous lesson, you must only proceed with this step if all of your customer traffic is shifted from your source endpoint to your destination endpoint.\\n3858: \\n3859: Once the execution is complete you need to make the traffic shift permanent. Depending on your service, this step may include code or configuration changes. For example if your service is a Coral service, the endpoints in the Coral client config package need to be updated. Your team lead can help you with how to make the changes permanent; in most cases this includes updating code or configurations and replacing your source endpoint with the destination endpoint.\\n3860: \\n3861: A good starting point is searching for your source endpoint on [code.amazon.com](https://code.amazon.com). Code and configuration changes are generally slow to propagate. In most cases you need to [build your changes to live](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/GettingStartedGuideBuilderTools/BuildingPackageLive), and your callers need to merge the changes from live, which could take a few weeks or months depending how many callers your service has.\\n3862: \\n3863: Once the traffic shift is made permanent, you need to cleanup the resources you used for traffic shifting. The cleanup must not impact the shifted traffic because it was made permanent. \\n3864: \\n3865: For example, if you used Weblab, you need to dial down the Weblab from (C: 0% , T1: 100%) to (C: 100%, T1: 0%). When you make this Weblab change, you must not see any shift in traffic because you have already made the change permanent. Once the Weblab is dialed down, remove the references from the callers code, and delete the Weblab. \\n3866: \\n3867: If you used TSA, you need to dial down your traffic shift, and delete the traffic shifting configuration. It is important to dial-down the traffic shifting tools under MCM before removing them. The MCM will be very similar to the traffic shifting MCM except you go in reverse and you should not see any changes on your dashboards. Again start with a smaller change and then increase. For example: 100% → 99.9% → 99% → 95% → 90% → 80% → 60% → 40% → 20% → 0%. \\n3868: \\n3869: In summary:\\n3870: \\n3871: 1.  Verify the source endpoint is not receiving any traffic anymore\\n3872: 2.  Make the code or configuration changes to make the traffic change permanent.\\n3873: 3.  [Track the changes](https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/pipelines/user-guide/reference-track-changes/) to make sure it is consumed by all tracking pipelines.\\n3874: 4.  Search your source endpoint on [code.amazon.com](http://code.amazon.com) and verify it is not referenced. This step does not apply if your source endpoint was a CNAME (e.g to your VIPs) and it was updated to resolve to the destination endpoint.\\n3875: 5.  Create an MCM to dial down your traffic shift. This MCM will be very similar to your traffic shifting MCM with the following changes:\\n3876: \\n3877:     1.  You are dialing down (from 100% to 0%) instead of dialing up. For example the Weblab goes from (C: 0% , T1: 100%) to (C: 100%, T1: 0%).\\n3878:     2.  In monitoring activities you should not see any changes on your dashboards because you have already made the traffic shift permanent.\\n3879: \\n3880: 7.  Clean up the resources you used for traffic shifting. For example, remove the Weblabs and TSA traffic shifting configurations that you created.\\n3881: 8.  If you modified your dashboards during the traffic shift, revert them to the normal state. For example, if you added the **ShowLocation=true** attribute or changed your service's alarm thresholds.\\n3882: \\n3883: ### Traffic Shifting Accelerator\\n3884: \\n3885: > **_GOAL:_** After completing this sub-module, you will have successfully shifted all TSA-compatible traffic for your service endpoints from DUB to ZAZ.\\n3886: \\n3887: \\n3888: {{info}}\\n3889:  If you determined not to use Traffic Shifting Accelerator (TSA) based on the previous lessons of the Traffic Shifting module, please mark the Create Traffic Shifting Configurations lesson as Not Applicable.\\n3890: {{/info}}\\n3891: \\n3892: The Traffic Shifting Accelerator is a tool that allows service owners to shift client traffic safely between different endpoints without needing to make changes to their client configuration packages during the shift. For more details on Traffic Shifting Accelerator please see [this wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/TSA/).\\n3893: \\n3894: ### User Guide for the Service Owners\\n3895: There are five major steps to conduct a traffic shift through the Traffic Shifting Accelerator:\\n3896: \\n3897: 1. **Complete the prerequisites:** Before using the Traffic Shifting Accelerator, service owners must enable CloudAuth on their service, onboard to Axon for metric visibility, ensure client connectivity to the destination endpoint, and verify that the destination service is scaled and ready to receive traffic.\\n3898: 1. **Create the traffic shift configuration:** Use the traffic shifting configuration wizard to create a new configuration.\\n3899: 1. **Get the configuration approved:** You need to seek approval from any upline manager (L6+) in order to start the traffic shifting. Once approved, you can create the configuration to dial up.\\n3900: 1. **Dialling up the traffic:** During the traffic shift, the service owner will gradually dialup the allocation so that the destination endpoint will receive traffic that was previously routed to the source endpoint. Some dashboards are also provided in the Traffic Shift Accelerator in order to be able to further monitor the traffic shift.\\n3901: 1. **Cleanup:** Finally, once the traffic shift has reached 90%, service owners will initiate a cleanup phase to ensure that traffic is not dependent on Traffic Shift Accelerator, and is reflected accurately in the client configuration.\\n3902: \\n3903: Please check out the [Traffic Shifting Accelerator User Guide for Service Owners](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Almanac/TrafficShiftingAcceleratorUsageGuideforServiceOwners) for the details and learn how to use this accelerator.\\n3904: \\n3905: The guide covers:\\n3906: \\n3907: * The detailed prerequisites of using TSA. \\n3908: * The key steps to shift traffic, including traffic shifting configuration creation, dialing up traffic, and cleanup\\n3909: * Monitoring traffic shift progress and service-side metrics\\n3910: * Troubleshooting common issues\\n3911: \\n3912: Whether you're new to the Traffic Shifting Accelerator or want a refresher, this comprehensive guide has everything you need to start safely shifting traffic.\\n3913: \\n3914: ### Next Steps\\n3915: \\n3916: Now that you're familiar with the Traffic Shifting Accelerator, proceed to the Create Traffic Shifting Configurations step to begin your traffic shift process.\\n3917: \\n3918: ### Troubleshooting TSA Traffic Shifts\\n3919: \\n3920: > **_GOAL:_** By end of this lesson, you will be able to troubleshoot common traffic shifting issues encountered when using TSA.\\n3921: \\n3922: To get support, please see [the TSA trouble shooting wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/TSA/Troubleshooting).\\n3923: \\n3924: **Additional Resources**\\n3925: \\n3926: * [TSA Runbook Entry points](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Almanac/Team/Internal/Oncall/TrafficShiftingAcceleratorRunbooks)\\n3927: \\n3928: \\n3929: # Migration Milestone 4: Descale in the source region\\n3930: \\n3931: > **_GOAL:_** By the end of this milestone, your service will require fewer servers in source region\\n3932: \\n3933: \\n3934: \\n3935: ## Module 14: Descale capacity\\n3936: \\n3937: Once your traffic has been running in the new region and you have passed the window of being able to safely roll back, you should descale your capacity in DUB based on the amount of traffic you migrated.\\n3938: \\n3939: Before descaling, we recommend holding onto capacity in the source region for **2 weeks** to allow workloads to go through their usual business peaks.\\n3940: \\n3941: This guide provides step-by-step instructions for descaling EC2 capacity in the DUB region.

As our business continue to grow, there’s a need to diversify the AWS region usage to improve capacity availability. By the end of 2026 when SDO exits DUB, synchronous-to-the-customer traffic currently served from DUB will be partitioned by marketplace to one of ZAZ or FRA, with requests for a given marketplace always going to the same region as per the [[Exit DUB strategy>>url:https://wiki.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Deep_Dives_and_Announcements/Announcements/Exit_DUB_Strategy]]. This guide provides migration coordinators and tech leads the guidance on how to coordinate the sub-experience migration from DUB to other regions.\\n\\n----\\n\\n=== What is a Sub-experience? ===\\n\\nA sub-experience is a specific part of a customer's interaction with SDO offerings. It can be a section of a webpage, a particular feature, or a set of related services. Sub-experiences can be migrated independently to target regions with minimal impact on business metrics like customer perceived latency. This approach helps break down large-scale migrations into smaller, manageable steps. Sub-experiences are identified in collaboration between the feature owners and the Region Flexibility Engineering (RFE) team.\\n\\n----\\n\\n=== Who are Migration Coordinators? ===\\n\\nMigration Coordinators (MCs) are the assigned employees orchestrating the movement of a sub-experiences to new regions, and are responsible for driving it to completion. Migration Coordinators are responsible for migration of a sub-experience, **moving the traffic to that sub-experience to another region **(for example ZAZ or FRA) with minimal customer impact in terms of latency, resilience, and other business metrics. Because this requires the entire call-path of the sub-experience to be migrated, the Migration Coordinator **works across organizations and technical owners**. While migration of sub-experiences is a key element of reduction of capacity in DUB, and the final step of sub-experience migration is to signal readiness to reduce fleets in DUB, Migration Coordinators do not have a specific fleet goal, or server reduction goal. Migration Coordinators work with RFE POCs on planning of migrations, identifying pipelines which are a part of the sub-experience, supporting teams who have blockers or need escalations, and identifying risks to migrations, resilience, or latency.\\n\\n* Owns the shifting of traffic for a sub-experience to a new region.\\n* Coordinates the timing of migrations, including service migrations and data migrations.\\n* Partners with the Technical Lead for a sub-experience to identify dependency pipelines, and maintains the sub-experience plan in RFP.\\n* Minimizes the impact of migration on business metrics, and provides a plan to recover.\\n* Works across the entire call tree, regardless of organization.\\n* Identifies blockers, risks, and issues for their sub-experience, and unblocks, accelerates, and escalates as needed to RFE or RFE partners.\\n\\n----\\n\\n=== What is a DARU L3 Fleet? ===\\n\\nFleet Management is an Amazon platform which allows organizations to track ownership of AWS accounts and non-Native AWS resources in a hierarchical ownership structure. This structure is used for financial budgeting and reporting, and contains all AWS resources billed by AWS. The largest SDO fleets on the third level (Amazon → SDO → L3) are tracked by the DARU program in the CloudTune organization for their migration progress from DUB to ZAZ, as a proxy for overall migration by SDO teams in tracking the status of the STEAM Exit DUB goal. These fleets are known as DARU L3 Fleets. \\n\\n----\\n\\n=== Who are DARU SPoCs? ===\\n\\nDARU SPoCs are owners assigned by DARU L3 Fleet owners who are responsible for tracking progress and R/Y/G status for their organizations commitment to DARU STEAM goals and their organizations role in unblocking migration of sub-experiences. In 2025, the main goal is to have no more than 60% of their 10/16/24 fleet scaling in DUB on 10/16/25. The DARU SPoC works with the DARU team to establish and track an organizational eLT goal which functions as a sub-set of the Amazon STEAM goal, which aligns to the 2025 CCI. During the year, the DARU SPoC will meet with DARU to measure progress and track status of the goal. \\n\\n* Associated with a L3 DARU Fleet owner. \\n* Owns and tracks progress against a DARU Fleet reduction goal. \\n* Works with teams to prioritize unblocking sub-experiences blocked by teams in their fleet. \\n* Identifies blockers, risks, and issues their fleet poses to sub-experiences, and unblocks, accelerates, and escalates as needed to RFE or RFE partners.\\n\\n----\\n\\n=== What if they are the same person? ===\\n\\nIf the MC and the SPoC role are assigned to the same person, they need to understand the distinction and which hat they are wearing at any given time. Some organizations are using a single, or a limited set of sub-experiences, to represent their organizations migration as a set of migrating services. Even in those cases, the engagement model is different between the two roles, and it will help to stay aware of the structure. Tracking metrics and progress, reporting to leaders and updating goals, and working with DARU leading up to DARU RFP are roles associated with the DARU SPoC. Identifying sub-experience pipeline dependencies, driving planning and escalation, working outside the organization to identify and track dependencies, and helping to unblock teams and reporting on migration risks are roles associated with the Migration Coordinator. \\n\\n----\\n\\n== 1.Planning ==\\n\\n=== 1.1 Identifying your sub-experiences ===\\n\\nFor the 2025 ExitDUB migrations, SDO sub-experiences are listed in the [[region-flex portal>>url:https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/subExperiences]] (RFP). These were defined in collaboration with the Tech Leads and Migration Coordinators (MCs) of the respective experiences. As we learn through the 2025 migrations, the Tech Leads and MCs can modify the sub-experiences for future region-flex migrations. A SIM can be created using the [[provided template>>url:https://sim.amazon.com/issues/create?template=b187d5df-e331-4eab-8517-e0368a3b9c82]] for introducing a new sub-experience, altering an existing sub-experience such as changing its name, removing a sub-experience entirely, or updating the MC or Technical Lead aliases. RFP will incorporate support for these operations by Q2 2025.\\n\\\\\\\\**Best Practices for Identifying Sub-Experiences:**\\n\\n1. Prioritize customer experience and business outcomes as the guiding factor. A sub-experience can also be a cohort of services that can move together, but we prefer to think of it as an end-to-end customer experience - although not possible to achieve for some businesses.\\n1. It can be migrated independently with limited impact on business metrics. For example, in the Shopping Detail Page experience, Below-the-Fold (BTF) has different latency requirements than Above-the-Fold (ATF) and can be migrated independently. For Fulfillment Centers (FCs) it will be individual FCs.\\n1. Incoming traffic can be shifted independently. It has a 'well defined' traffic entry/starting point (URI, service, etc).\\n1. Balance the coordination cost of managing sub-experiences. Each sub-experience requires a unique plan in the region-flex portal with milestones, which will be tracked and reported separately. Teams should find the optimal number of sub-experiences.\\n\\n----\\n\\n=== 1.2 Identifying Sub-experiences scope ===\\n\\n(% class=\\\"btn-group\\\" %)\\n(((\\nMigration Coordinators (MCs) and Tech Leads (TLs) need to identify primary dependencies for their sub-experience\\n)))\\n\\n* Region Flexibility Engineering organizes and tracks Sub-Experience dependencies in terms of Amazon Pipelines which deploy code or infrastructure required for the Sub-Experience to be served from a region.\\n* It is recommended that Migration Coordinators use tooling from RFE Analytics to identify transitive dependencies for AFT, Cart, Checkout, Detail, HomePage, and Search core experiences.\\n** The source of truth for these is the (% class=\\\"wikiinternallink\\\" %)[[RFE Recommendations to Exit DUB in 2025 dashboard>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/RFE-Analytics-Dashboard/RFE-REC/]]\\n*** Downloadable information can be found near the bottom of the page under “(% style=\\\"color:#212121\\\" %)Raw Data to Export”\\n*** A csv can be downloaded directly (% class=\\\"wikiinternallink\\\" %)[[from here>>url:https://drive.corp.amazon.com/folders/Region%20Flexibility%20Analytics/Analysis_Core_Experience_Primary/V4_2024_08_30]]\\n* Sub-experiences not falling under those core experiences need to work with their tech leads and RFE Analytics by submitting a (% class=\\\"wikiinternallink\\\" %)[[SIM >>url:https://sim.amazon.com/issues/create?template=bcb83ff9-0378-4efb-8fbc-31e9f295a0ac]](%%)to identify the call chains for their core services.\\n\\n----\\n\\n=== 1.3 Planning Sub- experience Migration ===\\n\\nMigration Coordinators, in partnership with Tech Leads, are responsible for driving the movement of a sub-experience out of DUB and defining the migration effort boundaries. It is recommended to use the sub-experience name in RFP ([[Region Flex >>url:https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev]][[Portal>>url:https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev]]), specific URI routes included with the sub-experience interactions, or data interactions in the sub-experience to inform the scope definition. The Migration Coordinator will use RFP to set need by dates for all pipelines within the sub experiences and ensure that the completion dates are tracked in sync.\\n\\\\\\\\Each pipeline will use RFP as the source of truth to create the list of dependencies required for migration to the new region and align availability of those dependencies with dates set by the Migration Coordinator. The Migration Coordinator will assist in this process by providing a centralized point for escalations and consolidation of asks between teams to keep migrations moving.\\n\\n==== 1.3.1 Program Plan ====\\n\\nThe program plan and timelines for sub-experiences and associated pipelines will be tracked through [[the Region Flex Portal>>url:https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev]], with time-gated milestones for each pipeline using this document as the source of truth, as part of the overall migration plan. If a pipeline fails to meet a milestone, the miss will be visible to the migration coordinator and runbooks will be followed to provide visibility in leadership reviews and/or escalations.\\n\\nIt is recommended to develop plans that address these risks:\\n\\n* Migration Process Risks\\n** What mechanisms the sub-experience will use to identify timeline risks and ensure [[timelines for Experience migrations>>url:https://wiki.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Deep_Dives_and_Announcements/Announcements/Exit_DUB_Strategy#HWhatarethecurrentidentifiedSDOsub-experiences3F]] are met.\\n** Communications between orgs\\n* Latency Impacts\\n** [[Manage Latency Commitments>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Latency/Projects/Exemption_and_CommitmentTracker/User_Guide/]]\\n** Notification plan\\n** Rollback plan\\n* Runbook Template\\n** The runbook will address common issues and escalation points for the sub-experience.\\n** RFE has an action item to provide an example Runbook to support this area.\\n\\n----\\n\\n=== 1.4 Establishing definition of done ===\\n\\nThe Region Flexibility program defines a sub-experience migration completed when the following criteria is met: \\n\\n* All of the in-scope sub-experience’s transitive dependencies are set-up in the destination region and serving sub-experience traffic from the destination region.\\n** To achieve this, please see [[Coordinating Migration of Dependencies>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Coordinating_Migrations/#H3.1CoordinatingDependenciesMigrationWorkflow]] section.\\n* All of the in-scope sub-experience traffic is routed to the destination region.\\n** Please note, the traffic scope for your sub-experience migration is defined in the planning phase and may include one or more traffic categories (e.g. Robot customer, Human customer), one or more marketplaces (e.g., ES, UK, DE, and IN), or a percentage of the traffic served by the DUB stack. \\n** To achieve this, please see [[Traffic shifting>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Coordinating_Migrations/#H3.4TrafficShifting]] section. \\n* All of the sub-experience’s transitive dependencies have de-scaled their stacks in the originating regions appropriate to the traffic shifted to the destination region.\\n** Please note, that depending on the traffic scope of the sub-experience, its transitive dependencies may not be able to fully de-scale from the originating region. E.g., if the sub-experience is scoped to move ES, UK, DE, and IN marketplaces, its dependencies will be required to de-scale capacity serving those marketplaces, but will need to keep capacity to serve other marketplaces like FR, IT, ES, NL, and etc.\\n** To achieve this, please see [[Descaling section>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Coordinating_Migrations/#H3.5Descaling]]. \\n\\n== 2.Executing the Migration ==\\n\\nAs a Migration Coordinator, you are responsible for driving the sub-experience migration to completion. After you identify the scope of your sub-experience, create and review your migration strategy, and submit your sub-experience migration plan in the Region Flexibility Portal, you enter the execution phase of the sub-experience migration.  \\n\\nDuring this phase, the communication and ability to adapt are essential. Amazon is executing sub-experience migrations for the first time and we will face both foreseen and unforeseen challenges. Looking around corners, communicating promptly, and leveraging the support system in place will help you navigate these challenges.  This section outlines a desired success criteria and Region Flexibility / DARU guidance to reach it.\\n\\n=== 2.1 Planning the Traffic Shift ===\\n\\nAs a migration coordinator, you’re responsible for driving the migration and therefore shifting traffic for the sub-experience to destination region with the help of your tech lead. This section introduces relevant concepts and decisions that need to be made to plan the traffic shift at the next level of detail compared to your existing migration strategy doc(s).\\n\\n**Define your acceptance and escalation criteria**\\n\\nThe first step is to understand the set of metrics you’ll want to track as part of your traffic shift to ensure that nothing has gone horribly wrong, and to define thresholds after which you would seek approvals before continuing. **__Note that you should be expecting to see degradation as part of the migration, and the conversation should be around what impact is tolerable.__** The L10+ level leadership is aligned with this expectation and your role is to facilitate and enable fast turnaround when the high-judgment calls need to be made to proceed with migration at an acceptable degradation.\\n\\\\\\\\Here are a few example metrics you’ll likely want to monitor, but feel free to add or remove from this list as appropriate for your use case. If you identify a metric you want to monitor but do not have available, work with your tech lead and other leaders in your organization to understand the feasibility of adding them.\\n\\n* Business metrics: Migration Coordinators should proactively identify the business metrics which will be used in decision making for their Service and identify how they can access these metrics. Examples of business metrics include latency Financial Impact (for Shopping Core Experiences, see [[this wiki>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Latency/Analytics/FinancialImpact/]]), conversion rates, click-through rates, resilience capabilities, or traffic. MCs may need to work with business leaders and finance teams to identify business metrics. These metrics may be required when planning migration timing, making straggler service acceptance decisions, or determining how long to accept the increased latency and resilience risks of cross region operations.\\n* Availability metrics: Migration Coordinators should identify, as possible, the availability metrics which are important for their sub-experience, and establish a dashboard which allows these to be tracked. It is likely that these metrics are Error rate, Order drops, Timeouts, etc. for the service which operates as an entry-point and traffic-shifting point for the sub-experience. These metrics will, for example, be used for automated and manual rollback.\\n* Latency metrics: Identify what latency metric(s) to track ([[TM99>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/TrimmedMean/]] is most common), at what threshold you would seek oversight/approval from leadership, and who in leadership you would seek approval from.\\n** Utilize your tech lead’s help to find the right metrics to track.\\n** Review your plans for what threshold to seek oversight/approval from leadership with your leadership ahead of time, so that you’re ready if something goes wrong. Aim for a threshold that lets you keep moving within reason, and allows you to seek approval from your L8 where the latency may cause too much impact on your customers.\\n** As an example on approval chains, for Stores sub-experiences, [[Central Latency’s guidance>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Latency/Analytics/FinancialImpact/LatencyGuidanceForRegionFlex/]] is to seek an L8 approval if latency exceeds your target threshold.\\n* **Example: See below for Search’s Latency Impact Analysis ( [[link >>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Search/RegionFlex/TrafficShifting]]to Search's Traffic Shifting plan)**\\n** **Latency & Dial-up Criteria: **We will use latency targets for each increase in allocation for our traffic shifts. These targets are TM99 TTI (time to interactive) **experience impact limit** and **treatment impact guardrail**. Experience impact is the overall latency to the marketplace at the current allocation, and treatment impact is the latency impact to just customers in the traffic shift treatment. We will work with central latency to determine these thresholds and review them with leadership as part of our 2025 latency goal planning.\\n\\\\\\\\Treatment impact is measured via the [[Central Latency Portal tool>>url:https://latency.corp.amazon.com/reports/search/]], and the experience impact is the treatment impact multiplied with the treatment allocation. As an example on how we will use these values, hypothetically we might pick 20ms as our experience impact limit and 500ms as our treatment impact guardrail. The table below illustrates how this affects our dial up decision-making process where we must not exceed either latency threshold.\\n\\n                             [[image:Search Example Table.PNG]]\\n\\n\\n* WAN metrics: Familiarize yourself with the [[Network Bandwidth dashboard>>url:https://toolbelt.irm.amazon.dev/dashboards/dub-zaz-network-health]]. You’ll want to observe this before, during, and after your traffic shift. Depending on the available networking capacity as you go to execute your traffic shift MCM, you may need to escalate to RFE. Process for communicating with RFE about bandwidth needs is available [[on our wiki>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Migration_Issues_Tracker/DUB-ZAZ_NetworkUsageApprovalProcess/]]. In Q2 2025, AWS networking will launch increased capacity links for WAN connectivity between DUB, ZAZ, and FRA, which are expected to exceed SDO requirements and allow us to sunset this process.\\n\\n**Learn the mechanics of traffic shifting**\\n\\nRFE developed the sub-experience concept to allow traffic flowing through related services to migrate while minimizing the impact of migration on latency and/or availability. This is done by keeping traffic for a sub-experience in a single region as much as possible to reduce the number of cross-region calls. Achieving this in your traffic shifting strategy requires:\\n\\n1. Controlling traffic at “sub-experience entry points”.\\n1. Keeping traffic in the sub-experience in the target region. - We have developed a Local Region Affinity (LRA) routing model to make this possible, you will learn more in [[Keeping traffic in the sub-experience in the target region>>url:https://quip-amazon.com/TluNAfX7gua1#temp:C:Led9148689ce26f499abc59da91e]] section.\\n1. Overriding the target region for “straggler services” - Services that aren’t ready yet but you don’t want to block the migration.\\n\\n=== 2.2 Controlling traffic as it enters the sub-experience ===\\n\\n==== Identifying sub-experience entry points ====\\n\\n“Sub-experience entry points” are the services or URIs that bring traffic into your sub-experience. You’ll need to identify these entry points early as they’ll need a bit of extra work to be able to control traffic into your sub-experience. You will partner with your tech lead and work with other technical resources such as service owners and Principal Engineers to identify candidates for this. Be sure to consider:\\n\\n* Entry URIs where traffic comes in from the external-to-Amazon internet. For Shopping and some other experiences, these URIs come in through AERO/OPF. This also includes AJAX calls that are indirectly made via browsers. For services using OPF the URI regex can found using OPF’s [[express debug>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Online_Proxy_Fleet/ExpressDebug/]] feature. As an example, ^/hz/wishlist(./*)?$, the URI regex representing wishlist in Sweden: \\n\\n[[image:image (24).png]]\\n\\n* Specific services that control the flow of traffic into your sub-experience, which often have the highest volume of calls but are easiest to work with.\\n\\nOnce you’ve identified your entry points, make note of them in your sub-experience page in RFP.\\n\\n====== **Capabilities required from entry point traffic shifting mechanisms** ======\\n\\nThe entry point for your sub-experience should be a central point where you can assert the most control over the call graph. Strong candidates are points which can integrate with WebLab, or WebLab-like functionality like % traffic controls, analytics, event-stream integration, and technical metrics which enable automated rollbacks. Selecting a point as near to the customer as possible is recommended, where call patterns are simple and narrow, making them easy to understand, and the risk of latency impacts can be minimized.\\n\\\\\\\\If your sub-experience is filtering on an additional traffic segmentation, such as marketplace, traffic type, end user device (e.g., mobile vs web), you should work with the service owner and PEs to ensure that the service which manages your chosen entry point has access to that dimension, and can control traffic based on it.\\n\\nIf your sub-experience is part of [[CRRE coordinated peak game-days>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/RedTeam/Experiments/CoordinatedGamedays/#HHowdoIknowifmyserviceparticipatesinCoordinatedGamedays3F]], your traffic shifting must utilize a Weblab in OPF, Shopping Portal, or another system that supports [[Weblab cookie overrides>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Weblab/Components/Cookie_Overrides/]] to ensure game-day traffic is treated the same as actual peak traffic. If not using Weblab in OPF or Shopping Portal, in addition to using the [[override-aware Weblab provider>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Weblab/WeblabAllocationProvider/#HWeblab-ScopedOverrides]], you must verify the service where the Weblab is implemented receives the cookies from the original customer request. Without overrides game-day traffic may be entirely treated as robotic traffic and sent to ZAZ potentially impacting availability or compromise the game-day results. \\n\\nIf your sub-experience participates in non-CRRE-led game-days, work with the game-day organizers to understand any special handling that is needed for game-days or test traffic.\\n\\n\\n====== **Recommended entry point traffic shifting mechanisms** ======\\n\\nSub-experiences that take traffic via OPF should default to leveraging OPF Weblabs to shift traffic for the OPF URIs identified as this sub-experience entry points. Non-retail OPF customers should leverage [[existing guidance>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/OPF/Operations/SelfService/OPFWeblab]] for OPF Weblab routing. Traffic Engineering expect retail customers to be fully supported by OPF Weblabs by early Q2. Retail customers looking to shift traffic for their sub-experiences prior to that should reach out to their RFE POC.\\n\\\\\\\\Be aware of how traffic shifting can impact your latency. OPF Weblab traffic shifting will continue to accept traffic to DUB, routing that traffic to a backend in ZAZ. While this allows shifting to be done in a controlled way, the traffic continues to flow via DUB, accepting a superfluous back-and-forth cross region call, and incurring a 30ms delay (up to 60ms under network impairment conditions, or 4x the expected in case a three-way TCP handshake is needed on a particular call). In Q2, Traffic Engineering will launch the OPF Edge Router feature for OPF, which will route traffic based on Weblab in the Edge, prior to the DUB datacenter. This change is expected to eliminate the additional delay incurred by the OPF Weblabs.\\n\\\\\\\\Non-OPF sub-experiences should default to integrating with [[Weblab>>url:https://w.amazon.com/index.php/Weblab]] directly to control the shifting of traffic at the sub-experience entry point, barring any integration blockers. Other options, such as bespoke solutions, should be approached carefully, as they are high risk.\\n \\n\\n====== **Keeping traffic in the sub-experience in the target region** ======\\n\\nThis section is for your education only; no action is required by the migration coordinator.\\n\\\\\\\\Service owners have been asked to onboard to [[LRA (Local Region Affinity)>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/LRA/]] to keep calls in the same region as much they’re called in, barring intentional overrides by a service team. LRA reduces the number of cross-region hops, and thus the latency impact of the migration. A diagram of what this looks like across a small group of services follows, with the blue node serving as the sub-experience entry point where you will manage traffic routing as a migration coordinator:\\n\\n[[image:image (23).png]]\\n\\n\\nRFE started an LRA onboarding campaign in Q4’24 for Homepage, Detail page, Checkout, Cart, Core Shopping, AFT and Percolate. As of 01/15 the campaign has 1661 Policy Engine (PE) risks open and 922 LRA endpoints created. To include your sub-experience in the PE campaign, reach out to [[#lra-interest>>url:https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07DA352U9G]] (this will become self-service on RFP by 3/7). You can view the LRA campaign status for your sub-experience on the [[RFE Policy Engine Campaign Dashboard>>url:https://us-east-1.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/dashboards/3e85196c-d79b-4905-802a-56f499348561?#]].\\n \\n\\n=== 2.3 Overriding the target region for \\\"straggler services\\\" ===\\n\\nDespite all of our best efforts, there may be services that aren’t quite ready when it comes time to shift traffic or have been discovered as a dependency only after the traffic shifting began.** __In many cases you will decide to move forward with the traffic shift regardless.__** These are called “straggler services”. Service B in the diagram in the previous section is an example of a potential straggler service.\\n\\\\\\\\As a migration coordinator, you are responsible for 1) determining which services (if any) can be left behind as a straggler, 2) ensuring that straggler service has a plan to migrate as a fast follow, 3) ensuring any straggler services has the necessary routing mechanisms in place to ensure traffic gets routed back to the source region (in this case DUB), and 4) ensuring services downstream of the straggler are notified they will receive reduced or no traffic as part of the sub-experience traffic shift. We’ll cover these in more detail later in this guidance.\\n\\n=== 2.4 Determine relevant traffic types ===\\n\\nThere are three main traffic types relevant to sub-experience traffic shifts. Individual sub-experiences may receive some, or all, of these traffic types under normal conditions.\\n\\n1. Test traffic: Traffic that does not impact actual customers, typically made up of manually constructed requests, utilizing test customers, run as part of continuous canaries, or captured and played back via “shadow testing”. This type of traffic can be utilized as soon as first set of dependencies set up in the destination region and is valuable for finding problems quickly without impacting actual customers, e.g., finding timeouts that need to be adjusted, dependencies that were missed and are forcing cross-region calls or data accesses, and service-specific defects. CRRE has the ability to continuously generate browser oriented test traffic for sub-experiences related to [[some customer experiences>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/RedTeam/Services/Ovis/TrafficProfile#HExperience2FCustomerJourney:CoordinatedGamedayTraffic]] including Homepage, High Velocity Event Landing Pages, Detail Page, Search, Browse Nodes, Cart, Checkout, and Your Orders. (% style=\\\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 0)\\\" textcolor=\\\"#333333\\\" %)If you already receive traffic from coordinated gamedays, follow (% style=\\\"background-color:#ffe600\\\" %)[[this self service guide>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/RedTeam/Services/Ovis/OvisContinuousTrafficforRFEMigrations]](% style=\\\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 0)\\\" textcolor=\\\"#333333\\\" %) to enable continuous traffic generated by Ovis at low scale for your sub-experience and reach out to the (% style=\\\"background-color:#ffe600\\\" %)[[(% style=\\\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 0)\\\" textcolor=\\\"#333333\\\" %)Ovis team>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/RedTeam/Support#HTicketing]](% style=\\\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 0)\\\" textcolor=\\\"#333333\\\" %) for any help or issues.\\n1. Robot customer traffic: Automated, computer generated traffic that represents non-human interactions with our systems, such as search engine crawlers or content scrapers. Migrating this type of traffic early is valuable for driving real traffic through a sub-experience without impacting human customer facing latency. Only RM-Certain and RM-High robot types should be selected as part of this traffic. Other robot types have slight chance of incorrect classification and may impact human customers before we are ready to traffic shift for them.\\n1. Human customer traffic: Human generated traffic coming from interaction with our websites and mobile apps. Shifting this type of traffic is generally where you want to apply the most care, as increased latency or error rates at this stage can directly lead to business impact like revenue loss.\\n\\nYour tech lead will be able to provide you with the best information regarding what traffic types are applicable to your sub-experience today and how, or whether, it can be separated from other traffic. If sub-experiences do not currently have test traffic, but believe it will be beneficial, they should explore adding it.\\n\\n=== 2.5 Determine what game days to run ===\\n\\nPrior to shifting traffic, you should plan to run scaling game days, which will establish that your service is ready in the new region, and is scaled to receive traffic that you intend to shift. To minimize variance from normal process, it is recommended that you use your existing game day processes, if you have them, to test out scaling, find AWS account limit gaps, etc.\\n\\\\\\\\There are two forms of testing which can be conducted. Hybrid options, such as manual replay for logged customer calls, may provide more nuanced options, depending on the technical context.\\n\\\\\\\\**Option 1**: Create game day traffic that is tagged in a way which weblab at the sub-experience entry point can route on and configure a weblab which routes 100% of it to the new region.\\n\\n* **Advantage**: Replicates reality, possible to use existing test mechanisms.\\n* **Disadvantage**: More complex, this option will require the load testing requests to be sent to DUB, additive to organic traffic, which may strain services which are upstream of the sub-experience entry point.\\n* **Example**: The Prime Video organization have built a shadow traffic system which routes a subset of requests to ZAZ as well as DUB, replicating the load DUB receives in ZAZ without risk of impact to customers. This allows them to confirm that the two regions provide equivalent responses, as well as monitor the scaling and readiness of systems in ZAZ.\\n* **Example**: Ovis can send synthetic, browser oriented traffic to some sub-experiences (such as Detail page and Homepage). Ovis supports the use of weblab overrides via the experiment cookie which can be used to route the traffic to new regions. Reach out to the [[Ovis team>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/RedTeam/Support#HTicketing]] to see if test traffic can be generated to your sub-experience in new regions using your traffic shifting mechanism.\\n\\n**Option 2**: Create mock traffic using TPSGen or an equivalent system (technical leaders should explore other options, including DJS jobs and simply scripting curl) and send it directly into the internal endpoint for the service in ZAZ.\\n\\n* **Advantage**: This is a simpler option which can test readiness and latency behavior from ZAZ endpoints without capacity strain in DUB.\\n* **Disadvantage**: Because this data will be mocked up by human operators, it does not replicate the patterns and content of customer traffic. Additionally, this option is unlikely to utilize previously build scale testing systems.\\n\\n=== 2.6 Assemble your traffic shift schedule ===\\n\\nNext you’ll want to assemble your traffic shift schedule. Each sub-experience is expected to have their traffic shifted completely by the \\\"Traffic Shifted By\\\" date specified in the RFP sub-experience migration plan. MCs should determine the traffic shift start date and schedule with that completion date in mind, and recognize that there may need to be iteration as learnings are found over the course of the traffic shift. Based on learnings from sub-experience migrations in 2024, RFE recommends at least a month of traffic shift time. In addition to your schedule, document all Weblab IDs, the services they are added to (e.g., OPF), and override methods (e.g., are cookie overrides supported) in the Region Flexibility Portal in the Notes section.  Section 4 that follows provides additional detail that may be worth taking a look at as you build your schedule, to better understand the types of learnings that may be uncovered as part of the migration.\\n\\n==== Timing ====\\n\\nWhen planning your traffic shift schedule, be sure to consider peak days, worldwide holidays, and day of the week. [[Change control policies>>url:https://w.amazon.com/index.php/ChangeControlPolicy]] seek to address peak days and key holidays, but they may not be sufficiently forward-looking to provide the guidance you need. In this case, look to the prior year’s calendar to understand likely risks to the calendar, recognizing some events or holidays can move from year to year.\\n\\n==== Criteria and speed for traffic shifting each traffic type ====\\n\\nWhere multiple traffic types are applicable to your sub-experience, test traffic should be run before robot customer traffic is shifted, which should be traffic shifted before human customer traffic.\\n\\n1. Test traffic: As soon as you have a handful of services in your sub-experience that have declared themselves ready by completing the service migration and recorded it in RFP, you can start running test traffic to find service timeouts and tune alarms. Continue running the test traffic as more dependency services become available in the destination region until you are ready to go to the next step of robot/human traffic shift.\\n1. Robot customer traffic: When the known critical dependency services are setup in the destination region you can start robot customer traffic migration. This will help determine service timeouts and cross-region calls that need to be fixed before the human traffic migration. Robot traffic shifts should be completed within 2-days provided there are no issues. If service timeouts are discovered during the robot customer traffic shift they must be fixed before going to the next step of migrating human traffic.\\n1. Human customer traffic: Business sensitivity to customer experience dictates the timing and approach of human customer traffic shift. MCs must establish acceptable degradation thresholds with tech lead and business leaders. For sub-experiences which have high latency regression bar e.g. core shopping experiences, RFE recommends to traffic shift slowly over a week. For such sub-experiences, limit cross-region hops before shifting customer traffic, using test and robot traffic for validation. TTI regressions can be observed with human traffic even after validations and latency exemptions may be needed. For sub-experiences which have not tested or migrated robot traffic it is recommended to use the human traffic migrations for testing as well. Start as low as 0.1% traffic shift and shift to higher percentages after confirming health of sub-experience.\\n\\n==== Traffic segments ====\\n\\nTraffic segments represent a portion of a traffic in a sub-experience that could be shifted to a new region independently of other traffic segments. Examples include marketplaces, mobile vs web, and fulfillment centers. If multiple traffic segments are included as part of a single sub-experience, you’ll need to decide if you shift their traffic together or one at a time. Key considerations include:\\n\\n1. **Similarity between the segments**. How likely is it for one segment’s migration to go well and another not, or for them both to have different problems you need to concurrently dive into before continuing the traffic shift? Likely factors include how many of the same services are utilized by each segment and how much unique configuration is tied to each segment.\\n1. **Likelihood services are ready to support one traffic segment before another**. A great example of this is the IN marketplace. This marketplace has a lot of marketplace-specific features, meaning services could easily be ready for other marketplaces (e.g., ES, UK) but not ready to support IN, in which case you may want to shift traffic for IN separately from other marketplaces, to minimize the risk of needing to debug multiple different issues concurrently.\\n1. **Potential learnings.** What would you learn from shifting traffic for different traffic segments at different times, and how will it change the proceeding traffic shift? If you don’t expect to learn much that would change your future traffic shifts, it may not be worth the timeline risk introduced by splitting the traffic segments into multiple traffic shifts.\\n1. **Timeline.** Do you have time to do multiple sequential traffic shifts ahead of your planned completion date logged in RFP? If not, you’ll need to shift the traffic segments concurrently.\\n\\n==== Post-traffic shift bake time ====\\n\\nAfter migrating 100% of traffic for your sub-experience, RFE recommends holding onto capacity in the source region for up to two weeks. Within two weeks, most workloads will go through their business as usual weekday and weekend peaks, making it the recommended period to hold onto capacity in the source region before releasing capacity.\\n\\n=== 2.7 Example traffic shifting plan: Detail Page Below the Fold (BTF) ===\\n\\n**__Acceptance and escalation criteria__**: Before starting the traffic shift these metrics were decided:\\n\\n* Increase in avg. clickToInteractive by >100ms. Sample graph for IN [[desktop>>url:https://tiny.amazon.com/aq0fvqj1/iGraph]], [[mobileWeb>>url:https://tiny.amazon.com/u0yolxpr/iGraph]], [[mobileApp>>url:https://tiny.amazon.com/pvz9ysws/iGraph]].\\n* Increase in [[RW>>url:https://rtla.amazon.com/explore.do?searchField=org&org=RETAILWEBSITEEU&affectedType=FATAL&range=7200&anchorTime=1710285600&anchor=Ending&filterSets%5B0%5D%5Bname%5D=FilterSet1&filterSets%5B0%5D%5BexpressionOperator%5D=and]] or [[DPX>>url:https://rtla.amazon.com/explore.do?searchField=org&org=DPXEU&affectedType=FATAL&range=7200&anchorTime=1710285540&anchor=Ending&filterSets%5B0%5D%5Bname%5D=FilterSet1&filterSets%5B0%5D%5BexpressionOperator%5D=and]] timeouts/fatals. There shouldn't be more than 5% increase for 3 continuous data points. Alarms are already scheduled as well for RW/DPX fatals.\\n* Decrease in DPX response size. [[Metric>>url:https://tiny.amazon.com/17og22h6x/iGraph]].\\n* Significant drop in metric logging. [[Metric>>url:https://tiny.amazon.com/wyw0m226/iGraph]]. If Detail Page takes too much time to load, this can lead to timeout in returning the client side metrics back to server, which can lead to metric drop.\\n\\n__**Entry point traffic shifting mechanism**__: Weblab integration at Shopping Portal (OPF’s Edge Router feature wasn’t available at the time).\\n\\\\\\\\**__Traffic types__**: Robot and human.\\n\\\\\\\\**__Game days__**: The Datapath team ran gamedays to validate that their ZAZ setup can support the new traffic and that there alerting and monitoring is working as expected before the traffic shift.\\n\\\\\\\\__**Traffic segments**__: Shift all impacted marketplaces together.\\n\\\\\\\\__**Traffic shift schedule**__: Traffic shifts were planned to start after midnight local time in the migrating marketplace with the most customers.\\n\\\\\\\\//Robots: //As this was the first region migration for a Stores sub-experience we were extra cautious and conducted it in two phases: testing and traffic shift. In the testing phase, Control (C) and Treatment (T) groups were equally split at 50% each, using exposure control to gradually increase traffic in the DE marketplace only. This phase lasted one week, with traffic incrementally increased from 1% to 100%. After resolving issues identified during testing, the traffic shift phase began. This second phase included all in-scope marketplaces without exposure control, starting with 0.1% for T and 99.9% for C. Over 1.5 months, T was slowly increased to 100% of production traffic//. [[Weblab>>url:https://weblab.amazon.com/wl/SP_DETAIL_BTF_ROBOT_REGIONFLEX_780991]]// was used for both the testing as well as prod traffic shifts.\\n\\\\\\\\//Humans//: While robot traffic migration gave us some confidence before migrating human traffic it was not enough as robot traffic is filtered out for latency analysis. So we started human traffic migration as well in two phases similar to robots: testing and traffic shift. In the testing phase, Control (C) and Treatment (T) groups were equally split, and exposure control was used to gradually increase traffic from 5% to 50% in the DE marketplace only. Weblab reports automatically generated for human traffic helped identify and fix TTI regressions. In the traffic shift phase, all in-scope marketplaces were included. A 0.9ms TTI regression was exempted by Core Experience leadership. Starting with a 50/50 split between C and T, exposure control was gradually increased from 1% to 100%. Finally, T was slowly increased from 50% to 100% of traffic. [[Weblab>>url:https://weblab.amazon.com/wl/SP_DETAIL_BTF_REGIONFLEX_778215]] was used for both the testing as well as prod traffic shifts.\\n\\n__**Additional nuances**__**: **As one of the first migrations, experiments were run in DUB before services were set up in ZAZ. However, this was a lengthy and time-intensive process, and RFE recommends against this pattern going forward.\\n\\\\\\\\Additionally, as part of this sub-experience migration all EUIN traffic was moved to ZAZ, which will not be the norm for most sub-experiences, and was done in large part to ensure sufficient server reductions in DUB in 2024.\\n\\n=== 2.8 Example traffic shifting plan: Detail Page ES, UK, IN Marketplaces 2025 Migrations ===\\n\\n[[image:1747918914665-846.png||height=\\\"579\\\" width=\\\"2092\\\"]]\\n\\n=== 2.9 Traffic Shift Baseline Signaling ===\\n\\nSub-experience traffic shifts and experimentaion generally happens incrementally to ensure that issues and latency degradations are identified and addressed while the small % of business traffic is shifted. This also means that the sub-experience can reach a certain % of traffic shifted and decide to dial-down back to 0 given the new issues discovered, which creates a challenging situation related to double holding capacity for all sub-experience transitive dependencies during the duration of traffic shifts. To mitigate this issue, Migration Coordinators are publishing their traffic shift schedule increases, as outlined above, but are also required to signal new baseline of traffic that is permanently shifted to a new region, so that their service dependencies can safely release the associated DUB capacity. \\n\\nTo signal new traffic shift baseline to RFE, please submit a SIM following [[this template>>https://sim.amazon.com/issues/create?template=14110c13-3927-47cb-8c95-4b7dfa0988fd]]. Please note, we are working on building the traffic shift % baseline signaling in the Region Flexibility Portal and will communicate the process change when the feature is released.\\n\\n== 3. Coordinating dependencies’ migrations ==\\n\\nAs a migration coordinator, you are responsible for driving and ensuring that all dependencies of your sub-experience are set up in the destination region and ready to receive the production traffic.

Adjust the scope of your sub-experience in RFP as needed.\\n1*. As you begin experimenting and traffic shifting, identify any potential missing dependencies and include them in the RFP scope of your sub-experience.\\n\\n----\\n\\n=== 3.1 Coordination Mechanisms ===\\n\\n==== 3.1.1 Support System ====\\n\\nAs a Migration Coordinator, you are not alone in this process. To help execute and unblock technical decisions, each sub-experience has an identified Technical Lead who is responsible for providing technical leadership and direction during the migration. In addition, each sub-experience has an assigned RFE POC who is responsible for supporting Migration Coordinators during the sub-experience migration execution and can help escalate and mobilize effort for dependencies in their organizations. Lastly, each sub-experience has a defined Experience Owner, who is an L8+ leader responsible for helping unblock prioritization conflicts and is there to help advise the team about business trade-offs related to migrations (e.g., what is the acceptable latency for moving human customer traffic).\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== 3.1.2 Input Metrics ====\\n\\nTo help you evaluate the status of your sub-experience migration, we recommend that you track and take action (follow-ups and escalations) based on the following input metrics and milestones for your sub-experience dependencies: \\n\\n* **Planning Completion:** Migration Coordinators should establish a need by dates for planning completion for all of their sub-experiences' transitive dependencies and track progress towards reaching 100% plans completed. Per-dependency planning completion ensures that all known dependencies are aware of the upcoming migration effort and have reserved sufficient resources to execute on their migration. Based on the current planning status of your sub-experience dependencies, you should take the recommended action as described in section 3.1.    \\n* **Traffic Shift Ready: **Migration Coordinators should ensure that all their sub-experience dependencies reach a migration state in the destination region at which they are able to serve the production traffic. Based on the current status of the dependencies readiness, you should take the recommended action as described in section 3.1. Please note, reaching readiness for 100% of your dependencies is not a pre-requisite to begin sub-experience traffic shifting and experimentation. More on this in [[Traffic Shifting>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Coordinating_Migrations/#H3.4TrafficShifting]] section. \\n* **De-scale completed:** Migration Coordinators should ensure to take the needed action so that all of the dependencies in their sub-experience de-scale after the sub-experience is dialed-up to 100% in the destination region. More on this in [[Descaling>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Coordinating_Migrations/#H3.5Descaling]] section.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== 3.1.3 Tracking Progress ====\\n\\nRFE recommends leveraging Region Flexibility Portal (RFP) for tracking sub-experience dependencies readiness per milestone. RFP provides set of oversight views that provide insight in current migration progress across all defined dependencies within a sub-experience. RFP also provides the ability to export this information in the excel format, with ownership and leadership roll-up information, to facilitate detailed project tracking per team/organization. RFE also provides analytics data to migration coordinators that can be accessed through the Dashboards in the RFP homepage or via custom queries using hubble.  \\n\\n----\\n\\n==== 3.1.4 Campaigns ====\\n\\nRFE utilizes Policy Engine(PE) campaigns to scale engagement and ensure visibility of the needed work with dependencies. Planning campaigns ensure timely notification of dependencies to plan for their work, whereas Execution campaigns notify dependencies to start their migration in time, so that they have sufficient time to complete their migrations ahead of the expected sub-experience traffic shifts. \\n\\nPlanning PE campaigns are now automatically launched for all sub-experience dependencies and Execution PE campaigns will be launched beginning in January 2025.\\n\\nTo support this process, RFE has built campaigning automation, established a partnership with the SDO Campaign Bar Raisers to ensure quality of campaigns, and established a streamlined process for campaign management. The Region Flex team currently supports creating Policy Engine (PE) campaigns to notify service owners of dependent pipeline of Migration Sub-experiences that they need to create Service plans in the Region Flex Portal (RFP) to support their Exit-DUB migrations. We have two PE campaign types: (A) PE campaigns for Non-Core Shopping Experiences and (B) PE campaigns for Core Shopping experiences (Search, Detail Page, Home Page, Cart and Checkout). Please follow [[Launching RFE Policy Engine Campaigns>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Coordinating_Migrations/Launching_Policy_Engine_Campaigns/]] procedure based on your campaign type.\\n\\nFor dependencies that are at risk or have overdue completion dates, RFE will help migration coordinators enable ticketing for their Policy Engine campaigns, to ensure the teams are notified and escalated timely.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== 3.1.5 Latency exemption and escalations ====\\n\\nMigrating services to new regions can increase customer latency due to geographic shifts, partial migrations, or specific traffic routing methods. While minimizing latency remains a priority, some increases may be unavoidable during the Exit DUB program. In these cases, MCs must consult their Tech Leads and request latency exemptions from experience owners, following established processes. Experience owners are prepared to make business-focused decisions regarding latency with a plan to reduce it over time. For Stores sub-experiences, Central Latency has implemented a streamlined approval process for latency exemptions.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== 3.1.6 Automated Leadership Emails ====\\n\\nRFE sends automated email notifications to L8 and L10 leaders with dependencies in scope of sub-experience migrations. This mechanism helps to raise awareness of the per-organizational progress towards executing on the needed migrations, highlighting at risk services, and services blocking execution of sub-experience migrations. Migration Coordinators don’t need to do any work, as these emails will be automated and managed by RFE. \\n\\n----\\n\\n==== 3.1.7 Monthly Program Review Escalations ====\\n\\nFor situations that require leadership escalation to resolve organizational prioritizes, RFE and DARU programs will enable Migration Coordinators to facilitate the needed escalation in the DARU / RF monthly program review. Migration coordinators should work with their assigned RFE POC to facilitate this process and ensure appropriate escalation management, including the invitation of the impacted leaders to the DARU / RF monthly program review.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== 3.1.8 STLT Reviews ====\\n\\nOn a quarterly basis RFE / DARU will present the program progress to the Stores Tech Leadership Team  (L10+) and a selected Digital and Other Leaders. This forum will provide an opportunity for top-down call to action across organizations, in case there are specific organizations impacting the overall program progress. \\n\\n----\\n\\n==== 3.1.9 Ad-hoc escalations ====\\n\\nWe recommend that migration coordinators escalate early and often, both to leadership that owns dependencies critical for the progress of the sub-experience migrations, as well as to DARU / RFE assigned SPOCs to help mitigate/resolve newly discovered technical or prioritization challenges. Where needed, RFE assigned SPOC can help facilitate L8+ cross-organizational escalations to ensure the sub-experience migration is unblocked. \\n\\n----\\n\\n==== 3.1.10 Status Reporting ====\\n\\nMigration Coordinators should use the Pipeline Status Overview feature in RFP to see the status of the pipelines in their sub-experience. You can also use the out of the box Hubble queries made available to us by the RFP team. These queries serve various use cases including \\\"Sub-Experience Planning Status by Leader\\\" ; \\\"Sub-Experience Planning Status by Pipelines etc.\\\" To access the queries, simply do a search for \\\"Region Flex\\\" in the Public Queries in the Workbench.  [[https:~~/~~/datacentral.a2z.com/workbench/query-explorer>>url:https://datacentral.a2z.com/workbench/query-explorer||data-sk=\\\"tooltip_parent\\\" data-stringify-link=\\\"https://datacentral.a2z.com/workbench/query-explorer\\\" delay=\\\"150\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"]]\\n\\n[[image:image (20).png]]\\n\\n== 4. Shifting Traffic ==\\n\\nThis section walks you through how you can audit when you’re ready to start the traffic shift, introduces the concept of “straggler services” that you decide to leave behind, explains how to guide relevant service owners in the traffic shift, and provides considerations for determining if you should continue traffic shifting or pause to resolve issues that arise. It also provides the Detail Page Below-the-Fold (BTF) traffic shift plan as an end-to-end example to ground the learnings.\\n\\n=== 4.1 Integrate the traffic shifting mechanism (e.g., Weblab) ===\\n\\nFor sub-experience leveraging OPF Weblabs, no additional integration will be necessary. If your sub-experience’s entry point is using Weblab directly, you’ll need to have entry-point services integrated directly with Weblab following [[their standard processes/documentation>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Weblab]].\\n\\\\\\\\When naming your weblab, please include \\\"_RF_MigrationID<RFE Sub-Experience Short ID>\\\" in your weblab name, but NOT at the beginning (which can break WLBR (WebLab Bar Raiser) routing). This will allow central teams like RFE to easily discover your weblab. Weblabs should be named SubExperienceName_ServiceName_RF_MigrationIDXYZ_SourceRegion_DestinationRegion_Year_TrafficType. For example, a region migration from DUB to ZAZ of a WidgetSeller sub-experience, which is being done in the WidgetService service, should be named WidgetSeller_WidgetService_RF_MigrationID12345_DUB_ZAZ_2025_Robots.\\n\\\\\\\\The Sub-Experience Short ID, can be found under the details section for each sub-experience available at [[https:~~/~~/ui.rfe.amazon.dev/subExperiences>>url:https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/subExperiences]].\\n\\nThis is important because you will receive a ticket if your weblab regresses customer latency on any of the core shopping experiences (Homepage, Search, Detail, Cart or Checkout) and will need experience owner approval to launch your migration. We understand that initial migrations will cause latency regressions and that in many cases the best claw back is to complete the migration as fast as possible. To that end, we provide an expedited approval process for traffic shifting weblabs which we will identify with this naming convention. The naming convention also supports automated reporting of migration induced latency impact. This is an important metric to safeguard the customer experience as we exit DUB.\\n\\nPlease review this [[Guidance on how to run experiments >>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Latency/Analytics/FinancialImpact/RegionFlex/LatencyGuidance]]that: (1) help you make data driven decisions (identify risks, blast radius) before traffic shifting, and/or (2) measure customer impact of actual traffic shifting.\\n \\n\\n=== 4.2 Audit traffic shifting readiness and identify straggler services ===\\n\\nUsing the same dashboards you’ve utilized to track your sub-experience, you’ll want to ensure services are getting ready as the start of your traffic shift schedule approaches. Now is the time where you’d look to identify the straggler services we mentioned earlier.\\n\\n==== 4.2.1 Identify potential straggler services ====\\n\\nRFE will provide a new view in [[each sub-experience page of the Region Flexibility Portal>>url:https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/]] to provide visibility on potential stragglers. This will be presented as summary stats of services that do not yet meet particular criteria - e.g., X services in this sub-experience have not attested they’re ready yet, or Y services in this sub-experience have not pointed their ZAZ LRA endpoint to ZAZ yet. These summary stats can be clicked into to get visibility on the specific services this impacted, and there will be an additional per-service table that shows the status for each pipeline that can be filtered and downloaded.\\n\\\\\\\\The currently planned set of readiness stats that will be tracked per service include:\\n\\n1. Not onboarded to connectivity solutions.\\n1. Connectivity not validated.\\n1. Not onboarded to LRA.\\n1. LRA endpoint in target region not updated.\\n1. Missing alarms/dashboards.\\n1. Not scaled up.\\n1. [Until sufficient automated checks are in place] Missing manual service owner readiness attestation.\\n\\n==== 4.2.2 Determine which services are stragglers ====\\n\\nDeciding if a service can be a straggler or not is a judgement call you’ll have to make. For each potential straggler service, your options are:\\n\\n1. **Make them a straggler**. Continue the traffic shift with the expectation of a cross-region call to the straggler. The service owner may need to take steps to ensure traffic gets back to the source region for this service, and downstreams will need to be notified.\\n1. **Disable features.** If a specific feature of a service isn’t ready, you could continue traffic shift but disable that feature in the new region until it’s ready. The service owner will need to take steps to disable this feature in the target region.\\n1. **Spawn a new sub-experience**. If a service is high enough up in the call stack, you can consider spinning it off as a separate sub-experience that starts at the potential straggler service. This decision will require you to set up the new sub-experience in RFP and identify the impacted downstream.\\n1. **Wait.** Sometimes, you just won’t be able to leave the service behind because it will lead to an unacceptable customer experience. Given the criticality of reducing servers in DUB over the next two years, this decision requires review with the RFE TPM team, who can be contacted at rfe-tpm@, and the migration of this potential straggler service will require escalation if that has not already occurred.\\n\\nSome of the considerations to weigh in deciding what to do with potential straggler services:\\n\\n1. **Placement in the sub-experience call stack. **If one of the earlier services in the call stack is a potential straggler, that means any calls that go through that service will not migrate. If a service is high up in the call stack, it may be reason to split out the sub-experience vs make the service a straggler.\\n1. **Latency impact. **If services in your sub-experience need to call cross-region to the straggler service and its dependencies, how will that impact the overall latency of your sub-experience? This is generally a factor of how many times the service is called sequentially throughout the call graph.\\n1. **Customer impact without the associated feature(s).** In some cases, a straggler service can be excluded from the call path by turning off customer features in the sub-experience. You should evaluate how the customer experience will degrade, using business metrics identified earlier in this guidance, if the feature is disabled - think of this much like a lever.\\n1. **Service readiness for other sub-experiences.** (Harder to deal with, but unlikely. The most likely version of this problem RFE expects is with IN-specific use cases, where a service was ready to handle ES + UK traffic but is not yet ready to handle IN-specific nuances.)\\n1. **Associated server count**. If this service represents a significant portion of the server count reduction your sub-experience is targeting, there is reduced value in migrating without it. This consideration will be most in play as traffic shift dates near peak events, and dependent on risks faced by other traffic shifts/hardware releases across the Exit DUB program.\\n\\nIf you need help deciding how to best progress in your migration, request a consult with rfe-tpm@.\\n\\n==== 4.2.3 Handling Approved Straggler Services in RFP ====\\n\\nCurrently all pipelines with timelines misaligned with associated sub-experience plan are flagged as at risk. If you've approved a straggler service, or for some other reason are allowing a dependency service to be out of alignment with sub-experience dates, you should create a new sub-experience called \\\"<Sub-Experience Name- Latency Insensitive> and move all such pipelines to this sub-experience. If the <Sub-Experience Name- Latency Insensitive> Region Ready By date is before 10/16/25, they will be included in the campaigns based on that need by date. If the region readiness date is after 10/16/25 they will be excluded from the 2025 migration campaigns. Longer term, RFP will add a feature to allow MCs to indicate a pipeline with a misaligned timelines is accepted.\\n\\n==== 4.2.4 Track straggler service workaround implementation ====\\n\\nOnce your straggler services have been identified, you’ll need to notify these services that they’ve been tagged as stragglers - that you intend to traffic shift without them - and that there may be urgent work for them to complete to ensure their traffic gets back to the source region. As a migration coordinator, you are responsible for ensuring this work (if there is any) is prioritized quickly to unblock your migration. RFE will provide special guidance for these services to help them understand what (if any) work is necessary.\\n\\n==== 4.2.5 Notify straggler services’ downstreams ====\\n\\nAfter your stragglers have started on any necessary workarounds, its important to notify their downstreams as well. RFP will provide an option in the straggler table of the sub-experience to notify their dependencies. Note to expect frustration in response - these teams put in the work to get ready in the target region and someone else didn’t put in the same energy.\\n\\n=== 4.3 Determine what data needs to migrate in parallel with traffic ===\\n\\nWhile many datasets will be able to replicate, cache, or via other approaches decouple data movement from traffic shifting, the exception is strongly consistent latency-sensitive data. Service owners will be provided guidance on how to identify they meet this scenario, what to do about it, and how to signal this requirement in RFP.\\n\\n=== 4.4 Create the MCM(s) ===\\n\\nYou will likely want a separate MCM for each traffic type applicable to your sub-experience. For now, we recommend starting from the MCMs used for Detail Page Below the Fold (Robots: [[MCM-98399127>>url:https://mcm.amazon.com/cms/MCM-98399127]], Humans: [[MCM-110901059>>url:https://mcm.amazon.dev/cms/MCM-110901059]]), but RFE is working on a template for you to leverage in the future.\\n\\n==== 4.4.1 Scheduling ====\\n\\nTime of day: RFE recommends to execute the MCM during the business day of the teams involved with the migration. This helps with quick debugging and help available from partner teams to understand the issues better.\\n\\n==== 4.4.2 Pre-checks ====\\n\\n* Check the RFP sub-experience plan and make sure the dependencies that you rely on for your traffic shift are available in the destination region\\n* WAN availability and available throughput. Check [[WAN dashboard>>url:https://toolbelt.irm.amazon.dev/dashboards/dub-zaz-network-health]] for current utilization and available headroom.\\n* Check blocked and advisory days in the [[change calendar>>url:http:// https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/ChangeControlPolicy/Calendar/2025]] for EUIN.\\n\\n==== 4.4.3 Monitoring ====\\n\\nAs you build out your monitoring plan, bias towards always moving forward. RFE recommends one consolidated dashboard which has all the metrics which will be monitored during the sub-experience traffic shift. All the “Carnaval Monitors” from dependencies should be added to the MCM.\\n\\n==== 4.4.4 Additional Details ====\\n\\n* All MCMs should include rfe-traffic-shift-notify@ in the “Also Notify” field. (List will be created soon!)\\n* Stores teams should include CTOS by adding the consumer-tos-team@ team in the “Also Notify” field.\\n* Rollback steps should be defined for each traffic shift increment.\\n\\n=== 4.5 Shift Traffic ===\\n\\nThe mechanics of how you shift traffic will depend on your earlier choices, but this should effectively amount to “execute the steps in your MCM”. For most MCs, this will involve adjusting treatment percentages in your Weblabs and monitoring everything you’ve outlined in your MCM. Congrats, you’re really shifting traffic now!\\n\\n=== 4.6 Debug ===\\n\\nTo help you decide what to do when something goes wrong, RFE will author a troubleshooting guide by 2/28 to walk through the most likely issues you’ll face, how to verify the underlying problem, and what steps to take. At a high-level, RFE’s recommended resolution steps will be prioritized in the order of: bring more services into the migration, pause the migration, and then leaving shifting traffic back as a path only when absolutely necessary to protect the customer experience.\\n\\n=== 4.7 Clean Up ===\\n\\nOnce you’ve shifted traffic and waited for your defined bake time, it’s time to clean up. This requires making the shift handled by your Weblab or similar mechanism permanent (e.g., changing the OPF or DNS route) and then removing any integrations put in place for that mechanism (e.g., deleting code, closing out the Weblab).\\n\\n== 5. Descaling ==\\n\\nOnce a sub-experience is determined to be stable for sufficient time in production - generally recommended to be two weeks, to provide time to observe regular patterns of business - the migration coordinator will signal to RFE that a sub-experience is ready for descaling, which will lead to an RFE-driven communication to service owners in that sub-experience to scale down and release hardware. For some service owners, this process is automatic - e.g., if they leverage Scaling Planner in MAWS or leverage any of AWS’ auto-scaling technologies. In others, RFE will look to leverage campaigns to drive the descaling.\\n\\nNote: Service owners will generally not be deleting environments in DUB until 2026. Doing so requires all traffic for the service to move, which most services are not doing in 2025.\\n\\n== 6.Future Migrations ==\\n\\nAfter your initial migration, subsequent migrations will follow slightly different patterns.\\n\\n=== 6.1 Second (or third, or...) migration to the same region ===\\n\\nFollow up migrations of the same sub-experience, for example when a team moves IE to ZAZ in 2026, should be much quicker than the initial migration of moving UK to ZAZ in 2025. In this scenario, builders will not need to set up infrastructure, and may not need to make changes to make their data accessible - it depends on their data strategy. Teams will have worked through details like timeouts, speeding up the sub-experience testing cycle, and the dial up will primarily want to test region-specific features and configuration.\\n\\n=== 6.2 Migration to an additional region ===\\n\\nThis process will feel fairly similar to the first region migration you lead. Teams should not have to repeat the pre-requisites if they were addressed ahead of the first migration, but otherwise they need to set up infrastructure, make their data accessible, test any configuration not previously tested, and scale. The expectation is that some of the steps will be easier on teams, if they've made the expected steps towards increased region flexibility in their first migration. The sub-experience testing cycle should be a bit faster, given teams have worked through issues like timeout management (assuming similar timeouts between source and destination regions) and learned a bit about how to operate in multiple regions.\\n\\n== Contacts Us ==\\n\\nThe first recommendation is check the [[RFE Contact Us page>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/ContactUs/]], since that's our consolidated area.\\n\\n==== Office Hours ====\\n\\n[[Scheduling time during our office hours>>https://office-hour-scheduler.tools.aws.dev/schedule/703f728e-1de8-4c4a-aeab-87fb03f1b018]] is the best way to get dedicated 1:1 support for any questions you have about Region Flexibility.

Traditionally TPMs use tools such as Quip to track dependencies but Quip doesn’t scale to the requirements of Exit DUB. Detail Page, for example, has 5K+ direct and transitive dependencies. When the dependencies have been added to the Sub-Experience Migration Plan, RFP will automatically show which pipelines have committed to the need-by date and which ones still need alignment. RFP will provide mechanisms (Policy Engine) that help to gain that alignment at scale.\\n* Services/Pipelines: Dram (as an example) may have multiple sub-experiences that call it as a dependency. Instead of Dram notifying each sub-experience claiming them as a dependency, Dram will be able to place a ZAZ availability commitment date in RFP that will be visible to anyone in SDO. Features that allow updates or links to Kingpin goals have also been requested to streamline communication.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== When do I use a SEP (Sub-Experience Plan)? ====\\n\\nA SEP is necessary when a pipeline grouping (such as a customer facing experience like Homepage) does not have a central Bindle or pipeline to work off of, but needs to coordinate movement out of DUB.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== When do I use a SMP (Service Migration Plan)? ====\\n\\nService migration plans should be used with Individual pipelines needing to create an RFP. All pipelines moving out of DUB should eventually have Service Migration Plans.\\n\\n* (((\\n* Individuals are able to create a migration plan for any pipeline residing in a Bindle they are an owner of. \\n* The RFP MP has the capability to automatically populate dependencies based upon service graph information. Auto-population of dependencies does not exist within the SEP framework.\\n* Pipelines are only able to be in one MP as the MP dictates the timelines, steps taken to migrate the pipeline, and other sensors that RFP will later include specific to pipelines.\\n)))\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== How do I use a SEP? ====\\n\\n* RFP entry for each sub-experience listed in the (% class=\\\"wikiinternallink\\\" %)[[wiki >>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Experiences/]](%%)have already been created. If MCs need a new sub-experience not listed in the wiki, they can create a sub-experience plan with assistance from RFE by submitting a (% class=\\\"wikiinternallink\\\" %)[[SIM Request>>url:https://sim.amazon.com/issues/create?template=b187d5df-e331-4eab-8517-e0368a3b9c82]](%%).\\n* Open the sub-experience in RFP from (% class=\\\"wikiinternallink\\\" %)[[https:~~/~~/ui.rfe.amazon.dev/subExperiences>>url:https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/subExperiences]]\\n* Populate the sub-experience plan with with pipelines by using the IMPORT button and uploading data from the Analytics dashboard. RFP validates each line/pipeline in the file so will take quite a while.\\n** The sub-experience migration plan does not have the capability to auto-populate dependencies the way that the standard Migration Plan does. \\n** It is recommended that all transitive dependencies are loaded into the sub-experience migration plan so that the pipelines are tagged as being part of that sub-experience\\n** Data must be in CSV format, with two columns and no headers.\\n*** Column 1: Pipeline\\n*** Column 2: Required for experience TRUE or FALSE\\n** Pipelines can be added to multiple SEPs without issue and it is actually recommended so that services are able to see their criticality.\\n* Alternatively, you can manage sub-experience plan pipelines by manually searching and filtering within RFP to bulk select and add pipelines to the scope of the sub-experience. They can use a combination of these controls to scope their pipelines for the sub-experience plan.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== How do I request to create a new-sub experience? ====\\n\\nStep 1 : Submit a new sub-experience creation request using this SIM[[ template>>https://sim.amazon.com/issues/create?template=b187d5df-e331-4eab-8517-e0368a3b9c82]]. Answer all questions in the SIM.\\nStep 2: rfe-oncall will assign the SIM to respective Region Flex POC.\\nStep 3: RFE POC will verify all required fields and details. They will reach out if additional information is needed.\\n\\nStep 4: RFE POC will create the new sub-experience and comment on the ticket once done. \\n\\nStep 5: The ticket will now be closed. Any further changes will require to submit a new SIM request.\\n\\nRFE PMO will respond to the SIM within 2 business days.\\n\\nPlease note all pipelines added to this sub-experience will automatically receive Policy Engine Risks and tickets to create a service migration plan via existing violation type.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== We discovered additional dependencies and want to add them to our existing sub-experience plan. How do we include them in the Policy Engine campaign? ====\\n\\nFor any additional dependencies you discovered after initial planning, follow the process below:\\n\\n* Add them to your sub-experience plan in RFP as soon as you discover them.\\n* Notify them over email and/or cut a SIM ticket in their CTI (if they have a intake process) before the RFE campaign kicks off.\\n* Automated PE risks will be issued by RFE (usually within 24 hours).\\n* They will be included in the next bi-weekly L8 leaders email notification from RFP and looped into the regular workflow.\\n\\nPlease note- all pipelines added to the existing sub-experience or in a new sub-experience will automatically receive Policy Engine Risks via the existing violation type. If you are adding more than 500 new pipelines to the sub-experience and want to  run a separate Policy Engine campaign by creating a new sub-experience for this additional scope, please reach out to your RFE POC. We will require  i) Your team's SIM Link for support (SIM template or Ticket Template) & ii) Wiki Link (Program Wiki) to include in the PE campaign.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== An owning SDM identified that dependencies which are currently in the sub-experience shouldn't be. How and when do we remove them? ====\\n\\nPipelines can be removed from a sub-experience by the Migration Coordinator or Technical Lead at any time using the edit feature in RFP. If an SDM owner of a pipeline asserts that their pipeline may not actually be a dependency, the Migration Coordinator and Technical Lead should investigate, and make a high judgement decision of whether it is safe to remove the pipeline from the sub-experience. This decision should be made in cooperation with the requesting SDM, marshaling the right expertise and establishing sufficient confidence that the pipeline does not actually constitute a migration risk for the service.\\n\\n~1. Pipeline owners (SDMs/Builders) who receive a violation and do not believe that they are a dependency should cut a ticket to the MC (links to templates and quicklinks are included in the PE violation contactURL field) or RFE using the link in the PE violation, or [[this quicklink>>https://sim.amazon.com/issues/create?template=1c116a08-1719-46d7-8983-92d3604ce790]].\\n\\n    ~* RFE recognizes that requesting these may be centralized to reduce churn, but the process does not require it because not everyone has this support. There is nothing wrong with a SPOC or other TPM cutting a larger list on behalf of the org in a single ticket.\\n\\n2. RFE TPM oncall will assign this to the Migration Coordinator for the sub-experience (@chapanir, @shantsr, or @nsandber)\\n\\n3. Sub-experience MC, TL, and the requesting SDM, will work together to establish enough confidence that the dependency is, or is not, real.\\n\\n4. Based on the outcome of analysis, the MC should note the outcome on the ticket and, if appropriate, remove the pipeline from the sub-experience, or move it to a latency tolerant sub-experience.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== How do I request for a change in my Sub-Experience Work Back schedule? ====\\n\\nThe work back schedule dates in the RFP is locked as of 1/30/2025. \\n\\nTo request for a revised timeline, \\n\\n1. Fill in this SIM [[template>>https://sim.amazon.com/issues/create?template=a2a32524-6316-4e8e-9190-30c46400c2d2]] and click Create an Issue.\\n1. Fill in all required fields.\\n1. Please make sure you communicate the upcoming changes to all dependencies and get alignment.\\n1. RFE PMO on-call will assign the SIM to appropriate RFE TPM POC.\\n1. RFE TPM POC will verify all dependencies are aligned and new timelines are within the required deadline. They will reach out if additional information is needed.\\n1. RFE TPM POC will update the sub-experience plan in RFP and comment on the ticket once done.\\n1. The new schedule will now be locked and SIM will be closed.\\n1. Further changes will require to submit a new SIM request.\\n\\nRFE PMO will respond to the SIM within 2 business days.\\n\\n====  ====\\n\\n(((\\n \\n)))\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== How do I use a Service Migration Plan? ====\\n\\nThe best way to get that information is through (% class=\\\"wikiinternallink\\\" %)[[the user guide created by the Region Flex Portal team.>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Portal/User_Guide/]](%%) Below is a diagram showing how the SEP (Sub-Experience Plan) and the MP (Migration Plan) interact within RFP.\\n\\n(% data-section-style=\\\"11\\\" style=\\\"max-width:100%\\\" %)\\n(((\\n[[image:https://w.amazon.com/bin/download/Region_Flexibility/Coordinating_Migrations/MC_Workflow/WebHome/vQ1M-gsVI-tT6DKCQNVB0g_image.png||alt=\\\"image.png\\\"]]\\n)))\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== Is there a recommended way to plan for Sub-Experience migration? ====\\n\\nYes! RFE is providing a [[Sub-Experience Migration Strateg>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Experiences/sub-experience_migration_strategy/]]y as part of the documentation set available to SDO. There is also a [[Migration Coordinator Dependency Workflow (in draft)>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Coordinating_Migrations/MC_Workflow]] available to assist in dependency tracking.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== What tooling is available to help me, as a migration coordinator, deal with this complexity? ====\\n\\nRFE is an in-flight program and constantly iterating to improve the quality of enabling tools. Our strongest tool for this topic is going to be the [[Region Flexibility Portal (RFP)>>https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/]]. [[Here >>https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/1236638 ]]is a demo of RFP.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== What Sub-Experiences exist today? ====\\n\\nFor currently identified list of sub-experiences, see [[here>>https://wiki.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Deep_Dives_and_Announcements/Announcements/Exit_DUB_Strategy#HWhatarethecurrentidentifiedSDOsub-experiences3F]]. \\n\\n----\\n\\n==== What is required in a migration strategy? ====\\n\\nThe migration strategy may vary from service to service. RFE suggest that MCs use this migration strategy [[template>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Tech_Guidance/Experiences/sub-experience_migration_strategy/]] as a starting point and iterate on the plan in collaboration with the RFE POC.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== What is the Region Flex Portal (RFP)? ====\\n\\nRFP is a one stop shop for migrations and integrations with dependency data analytics and migrations accelerators. RFP aim to unify everything service owners need to know and do for their regional migrations in this portal. See [[RFP demo>>https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/1236638]] to learn more about the tool.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== How do I fill the RFP [[sub-experience plan>>https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/subExperiences]]? ====\\n\\nMC and TechLeads have permissions to input and edit the RFP sub-experience plan for their area. Follow the instructions [[here >>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Portal/User_Guide/#HSub-ExperienceMigrationPlans]]to get clarity on what is required as part of the RFP plan.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== How do I find out which sub-experiences depend on my pipeline? ====\\n\\nThere are multiple ways to find out which sub-experiences depend on your pipeline in [[RFP >>https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/]]. The landing page has pipelines with \\\"Associated Sub-Experience(s)\\\". You can also use the [[Debugging Tool>>https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/debuggingTools]] to query your pipeline and find the sub-experiences associated with it. The pipeline name is case-sensitive and should match the exact pipeline name as in the [[pipeline tool>>https://pipelines.amazon.com/pipelines]].\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== How should teams without identified sub-experiences plan their migration? ====\\n\\nTeams without identified sub-experiences should plan for the 40% reduction goal and ensure that they do not block other sub-experience migrations. The planning [[dashboard >>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/RFE-Analytics-Dashboard/RFE-REC/]]from RFE provides the recommended services to migrate.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== What are the incremental traffic shift dial-up dates for the top-5 Shopping experiences? ====\\n\\n(% class=\\\"chat-alignment\\\" %)\\n(((\\n(% class=\\\"awsui_text-content_6absk_1e02k_142\\\" %)\\n(((\\n(% class=\\\"animated-bubble-text-container\\\" %)\\n(((\\n(((\\n(((\\nThe traffic shift dates for Shopping experiences are specified in the RFP sub-experience plan, which includes the start and end dates. However, RFP does not currently track incremental dial-up dates. Different Shopping teams use various methods to monitor their specific dial-up dates.

We are all learning and adapting as we make this journey.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== Can you make changes to optimize the sub-experience list? ====\\n\\nAbsolutely. But please work with your RFE POC and migration coordinator for any changes to ensure all related artifacts are properly updated.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== How do I get visibility into non-EC2 server capacity that my services are using? ====\\n\\nYou can get that data from [[DARU's RF planning dashboard>>https://us-east-1.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/dashboards/920605f0-b871-449a-bcdd-914c6155e83e?#]]. For any question on data post on #daru slack channel.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== What is the difference between sub-experience migration plan and service migration plan in RFP? ====\\n\\nAs a MC you must create a \\\"[[Sub-Experience migration plan>>https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/subExperiences]]\\\" for your assigned sub-experiences. Within your sub-experience plan, you will set the prescribed workback schedule for teams/services in scope for migration. You will also select the pipelines that should be in scope for migration for your organization. From there, the expectation is the teams that own those pipelines create a \\\"[[Service migration plan>>https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/]]\\\", where they configure the exact set of resources they plan to migrate together for which they will then execute the migration for. Service level plans require you to select a parent bindle, but this parent bindle is specifically for where the bindle resource for the migration plan itself will exist.  When creating a service migration plan, RFP creates a new bindle resource for the migration plan to allow you to manage permission on your plan itself.  For example, if customers want to create a service migration plan and ensure that their whole team has access to view and action the migration plan.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== What is the expected latency of the DUB<>ZAZ WAN link that I should plan for cross-region calls? ====\\n\\n(% style=\\\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px\\\" %)We are observing steady state avg 30ms round trip latency between DUB and ZAZ. But WAN has frequent planned/unplanned maintenance and in maintenance scenarios the latency can increase up to avg 60ms. So we strongly advise teams to plan for 60ms cross-region round trip latency between DUB and ZAZ. You can view the latency reports and available bandwidth on (% class=\\\"wikiinternallink\\\" %)[[this dashboard>>url:https://toolbelt.irm.amazon.dev/dashboards/zaz-connectivity]](%%).\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== Does region migration automatically trigger a need to re-certify the applications? ====\\n\\nRegion migration doesn't automatically trigger a need to re-certify. However, where there is a significant change to architecture of the service (e.g. AuthNZ technology) security recommends to do so. In addition, security recommends that all applications comply with the ongoing re-certification campaigns, but not tied to the region migration directly.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== What is the Exit DUB strategy changes due to addition of new marketplaces? ====\\n\\nThe France (FR) and Italy (IT) Stores marketplaces will now migrate to ZAZ by 10/16/2025, previously planned for migration in 2026 to FRA. The experiences included in the scope of migration are Homepage, Detail Page, Search, Cart, Checkout, as well as Ads. This change in approach is necessary to ensure capacity supportability. In addition, this change strategically drives Stores to exercise and accelerate region flexibility capabilities. In addition to this, the partial migration of German (DE) marketplace to FRA is delayed to post 10/16/2025, and will not contribute to 2025 peak capacity reductions in DUB. The region readiness need-by date for all sub-experiences supporting 2025 DE migrations to FRA is now updated to 10/30/2025 in Region Flexibility Portal and work back schedule is adjusted accordingly. This change in approach is necessary due to the timing of WAN network capacity buildout now aiming at 9/30/2025 for operational traffic, coupled with supply chain issues impacting some hardware delivery, which makes the completion of DE marketplace migrations infeasible prior to the Q4’25 EUIN peak.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== If FRA is not considered for 2025 reduction goal, does that mean teams should push FRA region readiness to 2026? ====\\n\\nNo, we still require teams to continue FRA region readiness. As mentioned above, this change in approach was necessary due to the timing of WAN network capacity buildout now aiming at 9/30/2025 for operational traffic, coupled with supply chain issues impacting some hardware delivery, which makes the completion of DE marketplace migrations infeasible prior to the Q4’25 EUIN peak. To mitigate these risks, we have updated the FRA region readiness dates for all sub-experiences to 10/30/2025. Teams should keep the momentum and plan to start shifting traffic to FRA in Nov/ Dec 2025. This will also help us stay on track for our 100% DUB exit goal for 2026.\\n\\n----\\n\\n==== What are the impediments for migrating to FRA before full bandwidth is available by 9/30? ====\\n\\n1. DUB-FRA WAN is limited to 300 Gbps until 9/30. Teams that want to operate in FRA must follow WAN network usage approval [[process>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Migration_Issues_Tracker/DUB-ZAZ_NetworkUsageApprovalProcess/]].\\n1. Upper bound supportability for symmetrical capacity (at least 3 AZs) is at 50k servers for Q4’25 peak. The current FRA usage is around 20k servers.\\n1. Foundational services such as Sable, Datapath, and Amazon API are not available in region until 6/30 – these dates may change based on the new guidance, but no later than 10/30. You can see the latest dates in this [[wiki>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Regions/Services/]]. \\n\\n----\\n\\n==== What is RFE's guidance for descaling based on sub-experience traffic shifting? ====\\n\\nRFE is running a descaling campaign in DUB to reduce capacity for services which have migrated to ZAZ. Details of the campaign are [[here>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CloudTune/CapacityManagementPlanning/Campaigns/DARU2025MigrationDescale]]. The DUB EC2 capacity descaling requires immediate attention to reduce the Q4'25 server footprint to 60% of Q4'24 levels, particularly focusing on sub-experiences that are undergoing traffic shifts. PE risks are generated for EC2 resource owners in DUB whose resources show a 2-week average CPU utilization running either 5% below their February 2025 baseline (for existing resources) or below 55% (for new resources). This campaign applies to all pipelines in DUB, including both MAWS and Public EC2 usage, regardless of Region Flex Portal (RFP) plans. The 2-week average CPU utilization measurement provides a built-in grace period, allowing sub-experience owners to adjust their dialup based on learnings during the traffics shifting. **NOTE**: Service owners should not wait for a signal from sub-experience MCs/TLs for descaling.
