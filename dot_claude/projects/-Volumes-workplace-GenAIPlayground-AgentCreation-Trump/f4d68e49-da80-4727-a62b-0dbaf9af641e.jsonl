Region flexibility is an SDO led initiative aimed at simplifying the efforts to get SDO services rapidly into new or existing AWS regions to address operational and regulatory challenges. Since 2020, SDO has been investing in components of regional flexibility by enabling technologies: Service Configuration Discovery and Routing \\\\(Axon, Almanac, Veritas, Planisphere, others\\\\), Data analysis \\\\(Metador, Andes, others\\\\) and movement \\\\(Hotwire/LMT, GlobeMaster, CDMS\\\\). While these investments allowed us to address specific pain points, Service/Application owners \\\\(Builders\\\\) are required to assemble these services to build out and execute a migration recipe that meets their need and addresses constraints. What is missing is a guided, friction-less customer experience or unified solution for Builders to orchestrate \\\\(fully/semi-automated or manual\\\\) migrations that addresses dependencies, run time latency needs, and shared data access constraints, while still keeping their business running.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAs an example, the Region Flexibility team may want to stand up \\\\(all\\\\) the necessary services for an experience in a new region, then migrate the data necessary for the experience incrementally and atomically \\\\(e.g. such that all the data for a specific customer appears in the new region together\\\\). This requires understanding the services' upstream and downstream dependencies, along with the computational views that the services consume. It also requires orchestrating data movement to aid functional debugging, validation, and auditing. Doing these migrations without coordination will be resource intensive for application owners and builders.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Our Vision ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nEnable SDO's businesses to operate outside of our existing \\\\\\\\\\\"mega-regions\\\\\\\\\\\" of IAD, DUB, and PDX; and enable the movement of traffic across AWS regions for the purposes of cost-efficiency, availability, change in legal compliance requirements etc. without effort from the service owner. The North Star for region flexibility is to centrally deploy services to new or expanding regions and move data and customer traffic between regions in a matter of months without negatively impacting service owners or customers. In short, most service owners should not need to know where their systems and data reside.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe IN Region Flexibility team's charter focuses on three core objectives: 1\\\\) Execute DARU S-Team Goal compliance and facilitate DUB exit for IES by EOY 2026; 2\\\\) Drive IES services to be 100% region flexible with optimal investments and overall org productivity enhancements; and 3\\\\) Develop robust region and data migration tooling via strategic collaboration with WW Region Flex Engineering \\\\(RFE\\\\) and Managed Migration Experience \\\\(M2X\\\\) organizations. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe IN Region Flexibility team owns UI console and Testing Framework in this initiative and is responsible for establishing new solutions and architectural patterns in these fields to help services owners get into regions more quickly, in partnership with different teams at Amazon.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Program Overview ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nhttps://w.amazon.com/bin/view/IN-Region-Flexibility/Overview/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Tenets ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\[TBD\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Architecture ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\[\\\\[image:https://maxis-file-service-prod-dub.dub.proxy.amazon.com/issues/cabe9f31-df17-4958-8ff5-d2aaa7c6e548/attachments/e693b07c32ba24ff14c5674857d1681c8cf20e973beca1924f7bc6db881c4c26\\\\_1b2ac41c-af1a-46f2-9b72-1b0990552717||width=\\\\\\\\\\\"50%\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Coordinator\\\\*\\\\* is an umbrella service which contains various different services/component. It is an orchestration service that delegates the entire migration process to various tools and components. These various tools and components will also depend on what type of migration a customer wants to perform.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*MetaDor\\\\*\\\\* is the the component that will power the discovery experience over the MetaData UI console. MetaDor will be the source of information for getting information required to enable migrations on service/dataset level. These informations will be used to prepare migration entity, MODs and MEDs.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*DRA\\\\*\\\\* is the component which will keep track of status of entities under migration and enable in routing traffic to proper region.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Data Movement Services\\\\*\\\\* is the component which will actually move the data, i.e, perform migration. It will also provide capabilities to Coordinator to start/stop/terminate migration at Dataset/service level. One of the example if this service is CDMS which is is a suite of data movement solutions for SDO data owners who need to move their data across AWS regions, partitions, accounts and storage technologies.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe detailed architecture for the entire Region Flexibility program can be found here

Flexibility refers to Amazon’s ability to run its businesses by utilizing compute capacity from a growing set of AWS regions. This gives Amazon more options to bring functionality closer to customers, leverage compute supply across wider geographies, and in certain cases like Enfield, comply with data privacy legislation. There are a growing set of important and timely reasons for SDO to be able to operate across a wider set of AWS regions than we do today. To accomplish this, SDO must be able to move data and software with much more agility across AWS regions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn 2022, Region Flexibility Program\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"--original-color:#16191f; color:#16191f\\\\\\\\\\\" textcolor=\\\\\\\\\\\"#16191f\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\) team partnered with SDO teams for a series of \\\\(%%\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*Investigations \\\\*\\\\*\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"--original-color:#16191f; color:#16191f\\\\\\\\\\\" textcolor=\\\\\\\\\\\"#16191f\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)into areas that will be important or problematic for region flexibility, but where there is no good idea of a path forward.

This will require a few key changes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Expand to additional regions. \\\\*\\\\*Get into more regions! De-concentrate out of our primary AWS regions today - DUB, IAD, and PDX - in order to grow and scale despite challenges such as physical limitations, changes in compliance legislation, and to reduce the blast radius of outages. It's been over a decade since SDO as a whole has gotten into new regions, and we'll need to re-learn what it takes.\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Support additional latency where it's appropriate and frugal. \\\\*\\\\*Enable SDO to leverage additional availability zones \\\\(AZs\\\\) and regions that are more distant than our services expect today. We'll drive experiments to assess and moderate the impact of both intra-service and inter-service latency, and leverage in-development service and data  graphs to identify where minimal latency can be introduced into the service graph.\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Make multi-region marketplaces possible \\\\(splitting .com\\\\). \\\\*\\\\*Enable a single marketplace to be served across multiple regions in the steady state. We'll need this approach for our largest marketplaces, such as the US, where one region can't sustain us forever, and when smaller marketplaces pass localization legislation. By splitting use cases or customers across AWS regions, we can improve our ability to mitigate region-specific capacity constraints.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Grand Vision ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nServices and data are automatically placed in the region\\\\(s\\\\) and AZ\\\\(s\\\\) they’re needed without builder effort or awareness, and guardrails ensure all new services stay region flexible from creation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== What can I move now? ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAWS region in ZAZ is open for use in SDO.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAWS region in FRA reached the \\\\*\\\\*General Availability\\\\*\\\\* milestone as of December 30 2024. It is now open to all SDO teams to build services. \\\\_\\\\_Please note the \\\\(% class=\\\\\\\\\\\"wikiinternallink\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\[\\\\[\\\\(% class=\\\\\\\\\\\"wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink wikiinternallink\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*Known Open Issues for MAWS FRA customers\\\\*\\\\*>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Tech\\\\_Guidance/Deep\\\\_Dives\\\\_and\\\\_Announcements/MAWS\\\\_FRA/#HKnownOpenIssuesforMAWSFRAcustomers\\\\]\\\\]\\\\(%%\\\\) section below that describes any SDO features not yet available in FRA.\\\\_\\\\_ \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn 2024, all services that are async, latency tolerant, or don't have a direct impact on customer facing experiences should migrate from DUB to ZAZ.

In this future, most services are agnostic of where their business logic and data reside, and only provide constraints and scaling signals to a central placement system solving for the Amazon-wide optimal solution balancing capacity availability signals from AWS, the optimal customer experience, regulatory compliance, and cost efficiency. With greater flexibility, peak events that require scaling beyond the available capacity of a single region can be served simultaneously from multiple regions, reducing our peak-to-mean spread and reducing CAPEX. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo accomplish this, we need to intentionally iterate on architectures that abstract networking and infrastructure management \\\\(e.g., moving to higher-level abstractions\\\\), reduce the number of architectural patterns SDO teams employ to build their services, improve the abstraction of telemetry and observability capabilities, and centralize the optimization of undifferentiated decisions currently made imperfectly due to distributed ownership \\\\(e.g., placement of capacity, timeout management, data migrations\\\\). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe begin by building core components that enable and reduce the effort of our most urgent cross-region moves, while guiding individual teams to adopt solutions and foundational systems that meet them at their current architectural abstraction and maturity \\\\(e.g., provide solutions for each of Lambda, managed runtimes, and JVM-on-EC2/ECS\\\\). We then intentionally build on the learnings from cross-region migrations into these central solutions and patterns, evolving SDO services with minimum builder toil \\\\(e.g., ship features via merge-from-live\\\\). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLearn more at our \\\\[\\\\[definition of a region flexible service>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Tech\\\\_Guidance/Deep\\\\_Dives\\\\_and\\\\_Announcements/Definition\\\\_of\\\\_a\\\\_Region\\\\_Flexible\\\\_Service/\\\\]\\\\].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Tenets \\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"font-size:22px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\(//Unless you know better...\\\\)//\\\\(%%\\\\) ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n//\\\\*\\\\*Region Flexibility \\\\(Updated August, 2023\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*//\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

We own the vision for how SDO gets into new regions, and influence which regions we move into considering regulatory requirements, latency, cost efficiency, and developer experience. You can review solutions that we are developing under \\\\\\\\\\\"Accelerators\\\\\\\\\\\" section.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== How does Region Flexibility impact me as a service owner? ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nToday, most of the work to get into new regions is on service owners. While the Region Flexibility team's goal is to eventually automate this work, we have a long way to go, and we expect our first region expansion/migration programs will be the most manual. Service owners are expected to set up their services in new region and then migrate their data and traffic, potentially in coordination with other teams. Our best knowledge on what it takes to get into a new region is captured in our \\\\[\\\\[Per-Service Region Migration Guide>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Tech\\\\_Guidance/Per-Service\\\\_Region\\\\_Migration\\\\_Guide/\\\\]\\\\] and in our \\\\[\\\\[Region Flex Portal>>https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/\\\\]\\\\].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you work through your first region expansion efforts, look for where automation could help you in the future, and either do that work now, capture it for the future, or where a solution could be widely reusable, share with the Region Flexibility team!\\\\\\\\n\\\"}\\n[1]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/\\\\\\\"\\n[2]: \\\\\\\"https://permissions.amazon.com/group.mhtml?group=region-flexibility-engineering-all&group_type=ldap\\\\\\\"\\n[3]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/XWiki/rohanso\\\\\\\"\\n[4]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/?viewer=code&showlinenumbers=1\\\\\\\"\"},{\"url\":\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Last_Mile_And_Middle_Mile/REALM/EPIC/RegionFlexibility/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Region Flexibility\",\"domain\":\"wiki\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1709232107000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":4,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n                    \\\\\\\\n      # Wiki source code of [Region Flexibility][1]\\n\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\n                        **Primary Contact **[hkhinda \\\\(user\\\\)][2]_[ How do I change this value?][3]_\\\\\\\\n                  \\\\\\\\n                                                                      \\\\\\\\n        Last modified 1 year ago by [hkhinda][4].\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n---\\n\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  [Show line numbers][5]\\\\\\\\n  {{transclude name=\\\\\\\\\\\"space:TransportationFrontline.REALM-EPIC.HeaderTemplate\\\\\\\\\\\"/}}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% class=\\\\\\\\\\\"MsoNoSpacing\\\\\\\\\\\" style=\\\\\\\\\\\"text-align:justify\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRegion Flexibility aims to make it easy to serve existing SDO \\\\(Stores, Devices, and Other\\\\) customer traffic from new AWS regions.

What is Region Flexibility?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Region Flexibility \\\\(RF\\\\) program is a multi-year initiative aimed at enabling SDO's businesses to operate outside of our existing \\\\\\\\\\\"mega-regions\\\\\\\\\\\" of IAD, DUB, and PDX. This will allow us to move traffic across AWS regions for cost-efficiency, availability, and compliance reasons without significant effort from service owners. You can find more information about the RF program on the Region Flexibility home wiki.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nB. Is there any good practices for Region Flex?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nServices should be decoupled from region-specific configurations by using full AWS region names instead of internal region names. Teams need to incorporate region flexibility considerations into their design and code review processes to identify and address region-specific dependencies. \\\\\\\\nInfrastructure efficiency should be prioritized through several measures:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpgrading capacity from Cascade Lake to Graviton\\\\\\\\nRetiring older instance series\\\\\\\\nReducing compute footprint through peak usage optimization\\\\\\\\nOptimizing database and storage resources \\\\[1\\\\] \\\\[2\\\\]\\\\\\\\nWhen implementing region flexibility, teams should:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAddress prerequisites by removing dependencies not available in new regions\\\\\\\\nSet up empty stacks in new regions with updated configurations\\\\\\\\nGradually fill stacks with data and traffic while testing\\\\\\\\nClean up old stacks after migration \\\\[1\\\\]\\\\\\\\nThe approach requires considering cross-region communication latency implications and planning accordingly. \\\\[1\\\\] \\\\[2\\\\]\\\\\\\\n Solution uniformity should be treated as a strategy rather than a goal, recognizing that customizations can be expensive long-term. \\\\[3\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n Teams should prioritize data accuracy and maintain transparency in all activities to ensure trust with partners. \\\\[3\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nC. What is the estimated migration effort?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBased on Region Flex analytics:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n80 hours for simple services, up to 230 hours for more complicated ones, a\\\\\\\\n100 hours for average services\\\\\\\\n200+ hours for more complicated ones\\\\\\\\nAssuming 50% of “effective productive time” for an SDE \\\\(discounting meetings, reviews, oncall and other sources of distraction\\\\), each service may take between 20 to 50 calendar days of effort.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nD. Which services are not available in certain regions?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nShared services - Infrastructure services to configure, launch, and operate service infrastructure, e.g., Apollo, Carnaval, Odin. The presence of shared services in new regions can be found here.\\\\\\\\nSDO infrastructure foundational services - SDO services that provide infrastructure for SDO to build their applications on top of, e.g., Datapath, Sable, G2S2, CloudAuth, and Allegiance. The presence of SDO infrastructure foundational services in new regions can be found here.\\\\\\\\nSDO foundational services - SDO services used by hundreds of teams across SDO, e.g., Datapath, Hex. Some of these services are not yet available in new regions \\\\(like ZAZ\\\\), and are in the process of being set up in the new regions. Please find their availability information here - https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Regions/Services/#HSDOInfrastructureFoundationalServices\\\\\\\\nE. Is it correct to assume a customer in marketplace X will use a service in region Y?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNo, Region Flex is also about easily enabling the service in to different regions. As commented here, Amazon wants the ability to vend traffic to customer from different regions in case of sudden ordering spikes during mid-night purchases where deals/promos/prime days are ending, optimizing cost-to-serve, availability and resilience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nF.

To ensure that SDO continues to have capacity to grow and to not impact other AWS customers in the region, SDO is now committed to fully exit DUB by the end of 2026. \\\\[\\\\[In 2025, SPS will take a 40% DUB capacity reduction goal>>SPS-RegionFlex.Yearly.2025\\\\]\\\\].\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo meet this 2025 goal, SPS will establish new regional instances of 1\\\\) services that are dependencies of retail sub-experiences \\\\(Checkout\\\\), 2\\\\) services that constitute 80% of SPS DUB IMR, and 3\\\\)  partner-facing Mons and SP-API applications. Each of these services will migrate relevant data and traffic to ZAZ, FRA, or both according to their \\\\[\\\\[routing strategy>>SPS-RegionFlex.RoutingStrategies\\\\]\\\\]. In 2026, SPS will complete our migration out of DUB by establishing remaining services in ZAZ and FRA, migrating remaining data out of DUB, and establishing at least a subset of services to HYD.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Other Initiatives ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn addition to exiting DUB, SDO will need to eventually exit IAD and PDX regions. IAD will primarily require SDO services to migrate from existing AZs to new, “Holiday” AZs that are more distant than existing AZs and have higher latency. The first “Holiday” AZs will become available in 2025 and specific fleets have been contacted to migrate. SPS teams should expect to begin migrating in 2026. Migrating to the new AZs will be significantly less effort than migrating to a new region, however there is still manual work required.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe RFE team is currently considering what regions will be made available to replace PDX. Selling Partner customers would benefit from new regions being located in southeast Asia, where the majority of Selling Partners are based. We will continue to advocate that the RFE team choose regions that offer benefit to our customers while also solving capacity constraints. We currently do not have even soft commitments on new region launches after 2025 and only know ZAZ, FRA, and IAD \\\\(Holiday\\\\) will be available long-term. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe below table is constructed using both the RFE team's roadmap for SDO foundational services \\\\(communicated in MBR\\\\) and the \\\\[\\\\[DARU program's timeline>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CloudTune/CapacityManagementPlanning/Programs/SDODiversifyAWSRegionUsage/\\\\]\\\\] for capacity reduction.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\[\\\\[image:region-guidance-table.png||width=\\\\\\\\\\\"100%\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Mental Model ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRegions mitigate a fundamental problem in computation, which is that distance generates latency. By collocating our services in regions, we can rely on a low-latency, consistent, and reliable network. Communication between regions occurs over large distances and across multiple network providers, meaning orders of magnitude higher latency, low consistency of that latency, much lower reliability, and significantly higher costs. Software that can rely on intra-region communication is simpler to develop, easier to maintain, cheaper to run, and provides a better customer experience. Services are best deployed to multiple regions and interact with other services only within the same region.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAWS currently offers 31 geographically dispersed and fault-isolated AWS regions across two AWS partitions \\\\(‘aws’ and ‘aws-cn’\\\\). However, only four of these regions have SDO-foundational software, such as CloudAuth, Allegiance, or OPF. SPS services are generally deployed into at least one of the three ‘aws’ partition  regions: IAD \\\\(NA / us-east-1\\\\), DUB \\\\(EU / eu-west-1\\\\), and PDX \\\\(FE / us-west-2\\\\). RFE identifies these three regions as mega-regions. These mega-regions are fast approaching their physical capacity limits, and simply reducing each service’s footprint is not enough to ensure we have continued capacity for growth. To permanently reduce capacity in existing regions, services must be either turned off or migrated elsewhere. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo that end, the RFE team is driving the establishment of SDO-foundational software in additional regions. \\\\*\\\\*No single new region will exceed or even match the capacity in existing mega-regions\\\\*\\\\*, so instead of doing a lift and shift migration, SDO must adopt multiple new AWS regions for each existing mega-region. If we assume that DUB, IAD and PDX will each require at least two replacement regions, then SDO will likely need to adopt at least one new AWS regions each of the next 6 years. This means we need a consistent, repeatable strategy along with automation that is integrated into our existing tooling and frameworks.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nServices at Amazon utilize a \\\\[\\\\[routing strategy>>SPS-RegionFlex.RoutingStrategies\\\\]\\\\] to determine where a request can be processed efficiently and where data is stored. Service owners may not even know which strategy they use - most services are routed implicitly by relying on utilizing services in the same region for any given request. However, the routing strategy informs a service which regions it must utilize and when, where data must be available, and how to coordinate with consumers and dependencies. It is important that services utilize a relatively small set of routing strategies to increase in-region service alignment and reduce complexity when communicating with other services. Service owners must start by identifying and formalizing their service's choice of routing strategy in order to plan migrations. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== How can I stay connected or get help? ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Watch out for emailed flashes and updates from \\\\[\\\\[wwsps-regionflexibility-core@amazon.com>>https://email-list.corp.amazon.com/email-list/expand-list/wwsps-regionflexibility-core\\\\]\\\\] \\\\(pre-subscribed\\\\)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Join the SDO-wide Region Flex Slack channel \\\\(\\\\[\\\\[#region-flex-2024>>https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C05D7C8PVDY\\\\]\\\\]\\\\)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Join the SPS-specific Region Flex Slack channel \\\\(\\\\[\\\\[#sps-region-flex>>https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C06NN8Q8V9R\\\\]\\\\]\\\\)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Contact your nearest \\\\[\\\\[SPS Region Flex SPOC>>SPS-RegionFlex.Contact.WebHome||anchor=\\\\\\\\\\\"HSPSRegionFlexSPOCs\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Contact \\\\(or join\\\\) the \\\\[\\\\[SPS Region Flex Working Group>>SPS-RegionFlex.Contact.WebHome||anchor=\\\\\\\\\\\"HSPSRegionFlexWorkingGroup\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\"}\\n[1]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/SPS-RegionFlex/\\\\\\\"\\n[2]: \\\\\\\"https://permissions.amazon.com/group.mhtml?group=wwsps-regionflexibility-wg&group_type=ldap\\\\\\\"\\n[3]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/XWiki/briahenk\\\\\\\"\\n[4]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/SPS-RegionFlex/?viewer=code&showlinenumbers=1\\\\\\\"\"},{\"url\":\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Users/saitejay/TechDocs/AWS/RegionFlexibilityOverview/\",\"displayTitle\":\"RegionFlexibilityOverview\",\"domain\":\"wiki\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1747608672000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":8,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n                    \\\\\\\\n      # Wiki source code of [RegionFlexibilityOverview][1]\\n\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\n                        **Primary Contact **[saitejay \\\\(user\\\\)][2]_[ How do I change this value?][3]_\\\\\\\\n                  \\\\\\\\n                                                                      \\\\\\\\n        Last modified 2 months ago by [saitejay][4].\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n---\\n\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  [Show line numbers][5]\\\\\\\\n  {{transclude name=\\\\\\\\\\\"awsui.beta\\\\\\\\\\\"/}}\\\\\\\\n{{toc/}}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# AWS Region Flexibility Overview\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDate: 2025-05-15\\\\\\\\nStatus: #reference\\\\\\\\nTags: #aws #region-flexibility #lra #migration\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## What is Region Flexibility?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRegion Flexibility is an AWS initiative to ensure services can operate across multiple AWS regions and migrate between regions with minimal disruption. This initiative is particularly important as AWS plans to exit certain \\\\\\\\\\\"mega-regions\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\(IAD, DUB, PDX\\\\) over the next 6 years, with some migrations beginning as early as 2024.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Key Components\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 1. Local Region Affinity \\\\(LRA\\\\)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLRA provides region-agnostic \\\\`\\\\*.lra.amazon\\\\` endpoints that resolve to regional endpoints based on the caller's region. This abstraction allows services to migrate between regions without requiring coordination with their callers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Benefits:\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\n- Decouples service location from service discovery\\\\\\\\n- Enables seamless region migrations\\\\\\\\n- Reduces cross-region traffic\\\\\\\\n- Improves latency by routing to the closest available endpoint\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Implementation:\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\n- Services register their regional endpoints with LRA\\\\\\\\n- DNS resolution maps LRA endpoints to appropriate regional endpoints\\\\\\\\n- Callers use the LRA endpoint instead of specific regional endpoints\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor detailed implementation steps, see \\\\[\\\\[LRA Implementation Guide\\\\]\\\\].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 2. Service Migration\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe process of moving a service from one AWS region to another, which includes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Infrastructure deployment in the new region\\\\\\\\n- Data migration or replication\\\\\\\\n- Traffic shifting\\\\\\\\n- Decommissioning old infrastructure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 3. Region Compatibility\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEnsuring services use AWS features and services that are available in all target regions. This includes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Avoiding region-specific services\\\\\\\\n- Using services with multi-region support\\\\\\\\n- Addressing deprecated services \\\\(like SimpleDB\\\\)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Current Region Exit Timeline\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| Region | Code | Exit Deadline | Status |\\\\\\\\n|--------|------|--------------|--------|\\\\\\\\n| Dublin | DUB | EOY 2026 | Active exit planning |\\\\\\\\n| US East | IAD | ~2028 | Early planning |\\\\\\\\n| US West | PDX | ~2029 | Early planning |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Common Region Flexibility Risks\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Deprecated Service Usage\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\n   -

For Buyer Risk Prevention \\\\(BRP\\\\), in 2025 this involves migrating critical systems across Payment Risk, Account Integrity, and Abuse Prevention from DUB to new regions: Zaragoza \\\\(ZAZ\\\\) and Frankfurt \\\\(FRA\\\\) with the goal to fully exit DUB by 2026. The goal is to improve resilience, meet evolving regulatory requirements, and enhance customer experience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Program Goals and Timelines ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Goal 1: Be prod ready for sub-experience \\\\(BRP is part of cart/checkout and identity\\\\) traffic migration\\\\*\\\\* by 7/31 \\\\(UK/SP marketplaces to ZAZ\\\\) and 8/15 \\\\(DE marketplace to FRA\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Goal 2: Achieve a 40% IMR costs Reduction in DUB\\\\*\\\\* by 10/16/2025. The bigger needle movers are the Bring Your Own Account fleets which have CORE owned service holding BRP data, we own those fleets for accounting purposes. We will also ensure that we leaving a manageable effort scope to fully exit DUB on 2026.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Migration Approach and Challenges ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRegion Flexibility team decided to perform the traffic switch in phases to reduce the complexity and risk by selecting sub-experiences \\\\(customer experience on Amazon web page that can be migrated mostly independently\\\\) and specific market places on 2025. BRP is only affected by cart/checkout and identity sub-experiences and we need to be ready for traffic switch by 7/31 \\\\(ZAZ\\\\) and 8/15 \\\\(FRA\\\\) for cart/checkout and 8/15 \\\\(ZAZ\\\\) and 8/31 \\\\(FRA\\\\) for identity. All the other marketplaces will remain in DUB until 2026, therefore this means the involved services will need to support traffic in DUB, ZAZ, and FRA during that period.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMany of our services are highly dependent on CORE team to run our fraud evaluations, we are working very closely with them to ensure their systems are ready by 6/15 \\\\(or earlier\\\\) to allow at least 6 weeks of service testing. We have agreed with CORE to replicate all the data in each region when necessary to avoid any fraud detection capabilities regression and only performing cross-region calls otherwise. If the BRP service is not latency sensitive, you can call CORE service or any other dependency not yet available on ZAZ/FRA with a cross region call which will add around 30ms with peaks of 65ms.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are working on a ML testing strategy to ensure that all the intents are well tested and have parity with current DUB performance before any traffic switch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Tech Strategy ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are working on a tech strategy document which will include BRP specific SOP to guide BRP service migration. We are currently reviewing the document with leadership and we will share it here when done. ETA 3/15.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Mitigation Strategies ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Risk 1: Resource and Sequencing Challenges\\\\*\\\\* BRP's Region Flexibility efforts can encounter risk due to overlapping priorities, competing initiatives, and peak workloads.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Risk 2: Data, Latency, and Model Performance Risks\\\\*\\\\* Decentralizing data and ML models across regions poses risks to fraud detection accuracy, latency, and data availability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Risk 3: External to BRP Dependency Risks\\\\*\\\\* BRP's success depends on robust mechanisms to monitor dependencies, escalate risks, and maintain alignment with teams like CARML and URES.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Key Points of Contact ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:942px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\\\\\n|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 163px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)Role Area|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 157px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)Overall BRP|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 130px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)Payment Risk|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 178px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)Account Integrity|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 127px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)Buyer Abuse|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 127px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)ML|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 119px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)CORE\\\\\\\\n|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:163px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*STL\\\\*\\\\*|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:157px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)psperez@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:130px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)psperez@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:178px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)shisrame@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)psperez@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)planfeng@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:119px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)prdeepn@\\\\\\\\n|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:163px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*Tech\\\\*\\\\*|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:157px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)gabeprz@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:130px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)ritikaj@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:178px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)bradcamp@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)torbettp@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)chienluc@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:119px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)prdeepn@\\\\\\\\n|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:163px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*Senior Leadership\\\\*\\\\*|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:157px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)ujjwalm@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:130px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)rajks@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:178px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)ajat@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)mrbohl@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)xiaohus@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:119px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)gddesai@\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Office Hours ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have weekly BRP Region Flexibility office hours with our Sr SDEs and ML PoCs.

Region flexibility is an SDO led initiative aimed at simplifying the efforts to get SDO services rapidly into new or existing AWS regions to address operational and regulatory challenges. Since 2020, SDO has been investing in components of regional flexibility by enabling technologies: Service Configuration Discovery and Routing \\\\(Axon, Almanac, Veritas, Planisphere, others\\\\), Data analysis \\\\(Metador, Andes, others\\\\) and movement \\\\(Hotwire/LMT, GlobeMaster, CDMS\\\\). While these investments allowed us to address specific pain points, Service/Application owners \\\\(Builders\\\\) are required to assemble these services to build out and execute a migration recipe that meets their need and addresses constraints. What is missing is a guided, friction-less customer experience or unified solution for Builders to orchestrate \\\\(fully/semi-automated or manual\\\\) migrations that addresses dependencies, run time latency needs, and shared data access constraints, while still keeping their business running.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAs an example, the Region Flexibility team may want to stand up \\\\(all\\\\) the necessary services for an experience in a new region, then migrate the data necessary for the experience incrementally and atomically \\\\(e.g. such that all the data for a specific customer appears in the new region together\\\\). This requires understanding the services' upstream and downstream dependencies, along with the computational views that the services consume. It also requires orchestrating data movement to aid functional debugging, validation, and auditing. Doing these migrations without coordination will be resource intensive for application owners and builders.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Our Vision ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nEnable SDO's businesses to operate outside of our existing \\\\\\\\\\\"mega-regions\\\\\\\\\\\" of IAD, DUB, and PDX; and enable the movement of traffic across AWS regions for the purposes of cost-efficiency, availability, change in legal compliance requirements etc. without effort from the service owner. The North Star for region flexibility is to centrally deploy services to new or expanding regions and move data and customer traffic between regions in a matter of months without negatively impacting service owners or customers. In short, most service owners should not need to know where their systems and data reside.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe IN Region Flexibility team's charter focuses on three core objectives: 1\\\\) Execute DARU S-Team Goal compliance and facilitate DUB exit for IES by EOY 2026; 2\\\\) Drive IES services to be 100% region flexible with optimal investments and overall org productivity enhancements; and 3\\\\) Develop robust region and data migration tooling via strategic collaboration with WW Region Flex Engineering \\\\(RFE\\\\) and Managed Migration Experience \\\\(M2X\\\\) organizations. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe IN Region Flexibility team owns UI console and Testing Framework in this initiative and is responsible for establishing new solutions and architectural patterns in these fields to help services owners get into regions more quickly, in partnership with different teams at Amazon.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Program Overview ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nhttps://w.amazon.com/bin/view/IN-Region-Flexibility/Overview/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Tenets ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\[TBD\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Architecture ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\[\\\\[image:https://maxis-file-service-prod-dub.dub.proxy.amazon.com/issues/cabe9f31-df17-4958-8ff5-d2aaa7c6e548/attachments/e693b07c32ba24ff14c5674857d1681c8cf20e973beca1924f7bc6db881c4c26\\\\_1b2ac41c-af1a-46f2-9b72-1b0990552717||width=\\\\\\\\\\\"50%\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Coordinator\\\\*\\\\* is an umbrella service which contains various different services/component. It is an orchestration service that delegates the entire migration process to various tools and components. These various tools and components will also depend on what type of migration a customer wants to perform.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*MetaDor\\\\*\\\\* is the the component that will power the discovery experience over the MetaData UI console. MetaDor will be the source of information for getting information required to enable migrations on service/dataset level. These informations will be used to prepare migration entity, MODs and MEDs.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*DRA\\\\*\\\\* is the component which will keep track of status of entities under migration and enable in routing traffic to proper region.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Data Movement Services\\\\*\\\\* is the component which will actually move the data, i.e, perform migration. It will also provide capabilities to Coordinator to start/stop/terminate migration at Dataset/service level. One of the example if this service is CDMS which is is a suite of data movement solutions for SDO data owners who need to move their data across AWS regions, partitions, accounts and storage technologies.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe detailed architecture for the entire Region Flexibility program can be found here

Flexibility refers to Amazon’s ability to run its businesses by utilizing compute capacity from a growing set of AWS regions. This gives Amazon more options to bring functionality closer to customers, leverage compute supply across wider geographies, and in certain cases like Enfield, comply with data privacy legislation. There are a growing set of important and timely reasons for SDO to be able to operate across a wider set of AWS regions than we do today. To accomplish this, SDO must be able to move data and software with much more agility across AWS regions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn 2022, Region Flexibility Program\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"--original-color:#16191f; color:#16191f\\\\\\\\\\\" textcolor=\\\\\\\\\\\"#16191f\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\) team partnered with SDO teams for a series of \\\\(%%\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*Investigations \\\\*\\\\*\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"--original-color:#16191f; color:#16191f\\\\\\\\\\\" textcolor=\\\\\\\\\\\"#16191f\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)into areas that will be important or problematic for region flexibility, but where there is no good idea of a path forward.

De-concentrate out of our primary AWS regions today - DUB, IAD, and PDX - in order to grow and scale despite challenges such as physical limitations, changes in compliance legislation, and to reduce the blast radius of outages. It's been over a decade since SDO as a whole has gotten into new regions, and we'll need to re-learn what it takes.\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Support additional latency where it's appropriate and frugal. \\\\*\\\\*Enable SDO to leverage additional availability zones \\\\(AZs\\\\) and regions that are more distant than our services expect today. We'll drive experiments to assess and moderate the impact of both intra-service and inter-service latency, and leverage in-development service and data  graphs to identify where minimal latency can be introduced into the service graph.\\\\\\\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Make multi-region marketplaces possible \\\\(splitting .com\\\\). \\\\*\\\\*Enable a single marketplace to be served across multiple regions in the steady state. We'll need this approach for our largest marketplaces, such as the US, where one region can't sustain us forever, and when smaller marketplaces pass localization legislation. By splitting use cases or customers across AWS regions, we can improve our ability to mitigate region-specific capacity constraints.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Grand Vision ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nServices and data are automatically placed in the region\\\\(s\\\\) and AZ\\\\(s\\\\) they’re needed without builder effort or awareness, and guardrails ensure all new services stay region flexible from creation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== What can I move now? ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAWS region in ZAZ is open for use in SDO.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAWS region in FRA reached the \\\\*\\\\*General Availability\\\\*\\\\* milestone as of December 30 2024.

In this future, most services are agnostic of where their business logic and data reside, and only provide constraints and scaling signals to a central placement system solving for the Amazon-wide optimal solution balancing capacity availability signals from AWS, the optimal customer experience, regulatory compliance, and cost efficiency. With greater flexibility, peak events that require scaling beyond the available capacity of a single region can be served simultaneously from multiple regions, reducing our peak-to-mean spread and reducing CAPEX. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo accomplish this, we need to intentionally iterate on architectures that abstract networking and infrastructure management \\\\(e.g., moving to higher-level abstractions\\\\), reduce the number of architectural patterns SDO teams employ to build their services, improve the abstraction of telemetry and observability capabilities, and centralize the optimization of undifferentiated decisions currently made imperfectly due to distributed ownership \\\\(e.g., placement of capacity, timeout management, data migrations\\\\). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe begin by building core components that enable and reduce the effort of our most urgent cross-region moves, while guiding individual teams to adopt solutions and foundational systems that meet them at their current architectural abstraction and maturity \\\\(e.g., provide solutions for each of Lambda, managed runtimes, and JVM-on-EC2/ECS\\\\). We then intentionally build on the learnings from cross-region migrations into these central solutions and patterns, evolving SDO services with minimum builder toil \\\\(e.g., ship features via merge-from-live\\\\). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLearn more at our \\\\[\\\\[definition of a region flexible service>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Tech\\\\_Guidance/Deep\\\\_Dives\\\\_and\\\\_Announcements/Definition\\\\_of\\\\_a\\\\_Region\\\\_Flexible\\\\_Service/\\\\]\\\\].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Tenets \\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"font-size:22px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\(//Unless you know better...\\\\)//\\\\(%%\\\\) ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n//\\\\*\\\\*Region Flexibility \\\\(Updated August, 2023\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*//\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

We own the vision for how SDO gets into new regions, and influence which regions we move into considering regulatory requirements, latency, cost efficiency, and developer experience. You can review solutions that we are developing under \\\\\\\\\\\"Accelerators\\\\\\\\\\\" section.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== How does Region Flexibility impact me as a service owner? ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nToday, most of the work to get into new regions is on service owners. While the Region Flexibility team's goal is to eventually automate this work, we have a long way to go, and we expect our first region expansion/migration programs will be the most manual. Service owners are expected to set up their services in new region and then migrate their data and traffic, potentially in coordination with other teams. Our best knowledge on what it takes to get into a new region is captured in our \\\\[\\\\[Per-Service Region Migration Guide>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Tech\\\\_Guidance/Per-Service\\\\_Region\\\\_Migration\\\\_Guide/\\\\]\\\\] and in our \\\\[\\\\[Region Flex Portal>>https://ui.rfe.amazon.dev/\\\\]\\\\].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you work through your first region expansion efforts, look for where automation could help you in the future, and either do that work now, capture it for the future, or where a solution could be widely reusable, share with the Region Flexibility team!\\\\\\\\n\\\"}\\n[1]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/\\\\\\\"\\n[2]: \\\\\\\"https://permissions.amazon.com/group.mhtml?group=region-flexibility-engineering-all&group_type=ldap\\\\\\\"\\n[3]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/XWiki/rohanso\\\\\\\"\\n[4]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/?viewer=code&showlinenumbers=1\\\\\\\"\"},{\"url\":\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Last_Mile_And_Middle_Mile/REALM/EPIC/RegionFlexibility/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Region Flexibility\",\"domain\":\"wiki\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1709232107000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":4,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n                    \\\\\\\\n      # Wiki source code of [Region Flexibility][1]\\n\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\n                        **Primary Contact **[hkhinda \\\\(user\\\\)][2]_[ How do I change this value?][3]_\\\\\\\\n                  \\\\\\\\n                                                                      \\\\\\\\n        Last modified 1 year ago by [hkhinda][4].\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n---\\n\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  [Show line numbers][5]\\\\\\\\n  {{transclude name=\\\\\\\\\\\"space:TransportationFrontline.REALM-EPIC.HeaderTemplate\\\\\\\\\\\"/}}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% class=\\\\\\\\\\\"MsoNoSpacing\\\\\\\\\\\" style=\\\\\\\\\\\"text-align:justify\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRegion Flexibility aims to make it easy to serve existing SDO \\\\(Stores, Devices, and Other\\\\) customer traffic from new AWS regions.

What is Region Flexibility?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Region Flexibility \\\\(RF\\\\) program is a multi-year initiative aimed at enabling SDO's businesses to operate outside of our existing \\\\\\\\\\\"mega-regions\\\\\\\\\\\" of IAD, DUB, and PDX. This will allow us to move traffic across AWS regions for cost-efficiency, availability, and compliance reasons without significant effort from service owners. You can find more information about the RF program on the Region Flexibility home wiki.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nB. Is there any good practices for Region Flex?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nServices should be decoupled from region-specific configurations by using full AWS region names instead of internal region names. Teams need to incorporate region flexibility considerations into their design and code review processes to identify and address region-specific dependencies. \\\\\\\\nInfrastructure efficiency should be prioritized through several measures:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpgrading capacity from Cascade Lake to Graviton\\\\\\\\nRetiring older instance series\\\\\\\\nReducing compute footprint through peak usage optimization\\\\\\\\nOptimizing database and storage resources \\\\[1\\\\] \\\\[2\\\\]\\\\\\\\nWhen implementing region flexibility, teams should:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAddress prerequisites by removing dependencies not available in new regions\\\\\\\\nSet up empty stacks in new regions with updated configurations\\\\\\\\nGradually fill stacks with data and traffic while testing\\\\\\\\nClean up old stacks after migration \\\\[1\\\\]\\\\\\\\nThe approach requires considering cross-region communication latency implications and planning accordingly. \\\\[1\\\\] \\\\[2\\\\]\\\\\\\\n Solution uniformity should be treated as a strategy rather than a goal, recognizing that customizations can be expensive long-term. \\\\[3\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n Teams should prioritize data accuracy and maintain transparency in all activities to ensure trust with partners. \\\\[3\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nC. What is the estimated migration effort?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBased on Region Flex analytics:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n80 hours for simple services, up to 230 hours for more complicated ones, a\\\\\\\\n100 hours for average services\\\\\\\\n200+ hours for more complicated ones\\\\\\\\nAssuming 50% of “effective productive time” for an SDE \\\\(discounting meetings, reviews, oncall and other sources of distraction\\\\), each service may take between 20 to 50 calendar days of effort.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nD. Which services are not available in certain regions?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nShared services - Infrastructure services to configure, launch, and operate service infrastructure, e.g., Apollo, Carnaval, Odin. The presence of shared services in new regions can be found here.\\\\\\\\nSDO infrastructure foundational services - SDO services that provide infrastructure for SDO to build their applications on top of, e.g., Datapath, Sable, G2S2, CloudAuth, and Allegiance. The presence of SDO infrastructure foundational services in new regions can be found here.\\\\\\\\nSDO foundational services - SDO services used by hundreds of teams across SDO, e.g., Datapath, Hex. Some of these services are not yet available in new regions \\\\(like ZAZ\\\\), and are in the process of being set up in the new regions. Please find their availability information here - https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Regions/Services/#HSDOInfrastructureFoundationalServices\\\\\\\\nE. Is it correct to assume a customer in marketplace X will use a service in region Y?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNo, Region Flex is also about easily enabling the service in to different regions. As commented here, Amazon wants the ability to vend traffic to customer from different regions in case of sudden ordering spikes during mid-night purchases where deals/promos/prime days are ending, optimizing cost-to-serve, availability and resilience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nF.

The Region Flexibility Engineering \\\\(RFE\\\\) organization is providing tooling and general guidance to teams to assist in the migration out of these regions and into new ones, as well as driving and coordinating campaigns to make services more region flexible. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis wiki is intended to supplement existing Region Flexibility guidance and documentation by providing SPS builders more specific resources and opinionated guidance both for short-term mitigations and for long-term flexibility.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Exiting DUB ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe capacity constraints in DUB are the most pressing. Datacenter electricity usage in Ireland \\\\[\\\\[exceeded 14% of all usage in 2022>>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61308747\\\\]\\\\] and the local utility has \\\\[\\\\[imposed a moratorium on datacenter expansion through 2028>>https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/06/17/up-to-82-data-centres-operating-in-republic\\\\]\\\\]. To ensure that SDO continues to have capacity to grow and to not impact other AWS customers in the region, SDO is now committed to fully exit DUB by the end of 2026. \\\\[\\\\[In 2025, SPS will take a 40% DUB capacity reduction goal>>SPS-RegionFlex.Yearly.2025\\\\]\\\\].\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo meet this 2025 goal, SPS will establish new regional instances of 1\\\\) services that are dependencies of retail sub-experiences \\\\(Checkout\\\\), 2\\\\) services that constitute 80% of SPS DUB IMR, and 3\\\\)  partner-facing Mons and SP-API applications. Each of these services will migrate relevant data and traffic to ZAZ, FRA, or both according to their \\\\[\\\\[routing strategy>>SPS-RegionFlex.RoutingStrategies\\\\]\\\\]. In 2026, SPS will complete our migration out of DUB by establishing remaining services in ZAZ and FRA, migrating remaining data out of DUB, and establishing at least a subset of services to HYD.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Other Initiatives ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn addition to exiting DUB, SDO will need to eventually exit IAD and PDX regions. IAD will primarily require SDO services to migrate from existing AZs to new, “Holiday” AZs that are more distant than existing AZs and have higher latency. The first “Holiday” AZs will become available in 2025 and specific fleets have been contacted to migrate. SPS teams should expect to begin migrating in 2026. Migrating to the new AZs will be significantly less effort than migrating to a new region, however there is still manual work required.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe RFE team is currently considering what regions will be made available to replace PDX. Selling Partner customers would benefit from new regions being located in southeast Asia, where the majority of Selling Partners are based. We will continue to advocate that the RFE team choose regions that offer benefit to our customers while also solving capacity constraints. We currently do not have even soft commitments on new region launches after 2025 and only know ZAZ, FRA, and IAD \\\\(Holiday\\\\) will be available long-term. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe below table is constructed using both the RFE team's roadmap for SDO foundational services \\\\(communicated in MBR\\\\) and the \\\\[\\\\[DARU program's timeline>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CloudTune/CapacityManagementPlanning/Programs/SDODiversifyAWSRegionUsage/\\\\]\\\\] for capacity reduction.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\[\\\\[image:region-guidance-table.png||width=\\\\\\\\\\\"100%\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Mental Model ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRegions mitigate a fundamental problem in computation, which is that distance generates latency. By collocating our services in regions, we can rely on a low-latency, consistent, and reliable network. Communication between regions occurs over large distances and across multiple network providers, meaning orders of magnitude higher latency, low consistency of that latency, much lower reliability, and significantly higher costs. Software that can rely on intra-region communication is simpler to develop, easier to maintain, cheaper to run, and provides a better customer experience. Services are best deployed to multiple regions and interact with other services only within the same region.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAWS currently offers 31 geographically dispersed and fault-isolated AWS regions across two AWS partitions \\\\(‘aws’ and ‘aws-cn’\\\\). However, only four of these regions have SDO-foundational software, such as CloudAuth, Allegiance, or OPF. SPS services are generally deployed into at least one of the three ‘aws’ partition  regions: IAD \\\\(NA / us-east-1\\\\), DUB \\\\(EU / eu-west-1\\\\), and PDX \\\\(FE / us-west-2\\\\). RFE identifies these three regions as mega-regions. These mega-regions are fast approaching their physical capacity limits, and simply reducing each service’s footprint is not enough to ensure we have continued capacity for growth. To permanently reduce capacity in existing regions, services must be either turned off or migrated elsewhere. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo that end, the RFE team is driving the establishment of SDO-foundational software in additional regions. \\\\*\\\\*No single new region will exceed or even match the capacity in existing mega-regions\\\\*\\\\*, so instead of doing a lift and shift migration, SDO must adopt multiple new AWS regions for each existing mega-region. If we assume that DUB, IAD and PDX will each require at least two replacement regions, then SDO will likely need to adopt at least one new AWS regions each of the next 6 years. This means we need a consistent, repeatable strategy along with automation that is integrated into our existing tooling and frameworks.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nServices at Amazon utilize a \\\\[\\\\[routing strategy>>SPS-RegionFlex.RoutingStrategies\\\\]\\\\] to determine where a request can be processed efficiently and where data is stored. Service owners may not even know which strategy they use - most services are routed implicitly by relying on utilizing services in the same region for any given request. However, the routing strategy informs a service which regions it must utilize and when, where data must be available, and how to coordinate with consumers and dependencies. It is important that services utilize a relatively small set of routing strategies to increase in-region service alignment and reduce complexity when communicating with other services. Service owners must start by identifying and formalizing their service's choice of routing strategy in order to plan migrations. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== How can I stay connected or get help? ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Watch out for emailed flashes and updates from \\\\[\\\\[wwsps-regionflexibility-core@amazon.com>>https://email-list.corp.amazon.com/email-list/expand-list/wwsps-regionflexibility-core\\\\]\\\\] \\\\(pre-subscribed\\\\)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Join the SDO-wide Region Flex Slack channel \\\\(\\\\[\\\\[#region-flex-2024>>https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C05D7C8PVDY\\\\]\\\\]\\\\)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Join the SPS-specific Region Flex Slack channel \\\\(\\\\[\\\\[#sps-region-flex>>https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C06NN8Q8V9R\\\\]\\\\]\\\\)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Contact your nearest \\\\[\\\\[SPS Region Flex SPOC>>SPS-RegionFlex.Contact.WebHome||anchor=\\\\\\\\\\\"HSPSRegionFlexSPOCs\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Contact \\\\(or join\\\\) the \\\\[\\\\[SPS Region Flex Working Group>>SPS-RegionFlex.Contact.WebHome||anchor=\\\\\\\\\\\"HSPSRegionFlexWorkingGroup\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\"}\\n[1]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/SPS-RegionFlex/\\\\\\\"\\n[2]: \\\\\\\"https://permissions.amazon.com/group.mhtml?group=wwsps-regionflexibility-wg&group_type=ldap\\\\\\\"\\n[3]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/XWiki/briahenk\\\\\\\"\\n[4]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/SPS-RegionFlex/?viewer=code&showlinenumbers=1\\\\\\\"\"},{\"url\":\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Users/saitejay/TechDocs/AWS/RegionFlexibilityOverview/\",\"displayTitle\":\"RegionFlexibilityOverview\",\"domain\":\"wiki\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1747608672000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":8,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n                    \\\\\\\\n      # Wiki source code of [RegionFlexibilityOverview][1]\\n\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\n                        **Primary Contact **[saitejay \\\\(user\\\\)][2]_[ How do I change this value?][3]_\\\\\\\\n                  \\\\\\\\n                                                                      \\\\\\\\n        Last modified 2 months ago by [saitejay][4].\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n---\\n\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  [Show line numbers][5]\\\\\\\\n  {{transclude name=\\\\\\\\\\\"awsui.beta\\\\\\\\\\\"/}}\\\\\\\\n{{toc/}}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# AWS Region Flexibility Overview\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDate: 2025-05-15\\\\\\\\nStatus: #reference\\\\\\\\nTags: #aws #region-flexibility #lra #migration\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## What is Region Flexibility?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRegion Flexibility is an AWS initiative to ensure services can operate across multiple AWS regions and migrate between regions with minimal disruption. This initiative is particularly important as AWS plans to exit certain \\\\\\\\\\\"mega-regions\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\(IAD, DUB, PDX\\\\) over the next 6 years, with some migrations beginning as early as 2024.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Key Components\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 1. Local Region Affinity \\\\(LRA\\\\)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLRA provides region-agnostic \\\\`\\\\*.lra.amazon\\\\` endpoints that resolve to regional endpoints based on the caller's region. This abstraction allows services to migrate between regions without requiring coordination with their callers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Benefits:\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\n- Decouples service location from service discovery\\\\\\\\n- Enables seamless region migrations\\\\\\\\n- Reduces cross-region traffic\\\\\\\\n- Improves latency by routing to the closest available endpoint\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Implementation:\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\n- Services register their regional endpoints with LRA\\\\\\\\n- DNS resolution maps LRA endpoints to appropriate regional endpoints\\\\\\\\n- Callers use the LRA endpoint instead of specific regional endpoints\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor detailed implementation steps, see \\\\[\\\\[LRA Implementation Guide\\\\]\\\\].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 2. Service Migration\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe process of moving a service from one AWS region to another, which includes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Infrastructure deployment in the new region\\\\\\\\n- Data migration or replication\\\\\\\\n- Traffic shifting\\\\\\\\n- Decommissioning old infrastructure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 3. Region Compatibility\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEnsuring services use AWS features and services that are available in all target regions.

For Buyer Risk Prevention \\\\(BRP\\\\), in 2025 this involves migrating critical systems across Payment Risk, Account Integrity, and Abuse Prevention from DUB to new regions: Zaragoza \\\\(ZAZ\\\\) and Frankfurt \\\\(FRA\\\\) with the goal to fully exit DUB by 2026. The goal is to improve resilience, meet evolving regulatory requirements, and enhance customer experience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Program Goals and Timelines ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Goal 1: Be prod ready for sub-experience \\\\(BRP is part of cart/checkout and identity\\\\) traffic migration\\\\*\\\\* by 7/31 \\\\(UK/SP marketplaces to ZAZ\\\\) and 8/15 \\\\(DE marketplace to FRA\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Goal 2: Achieve a 40% IMR costs Reduction in DUB\\\\*\\\\* by 10/16/2025. The bigger needle movers are the Bring Your Own Account fleets which have CORE owned service holding BRP data, we own those fleets for accounting purposes. We will also ensure that we leaving a manageable effort scope to fully exit DUB on 2026.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Migration Approach and Challenges ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRegion Flexibility team decided to perform the traffic switch in phases to reduce the complexity and risk by selecting sub-experiences \\\\(customer experience on Amazon web page that can be migrated mostly independently\\\\) and specific market places on 2025. BRP is only affected by cart/checkout and identity sub-experiences and we need to be ready for traffic switch by 7/31 \\\\(ZAZ\\\\) and 8/15 \\\\(FRA\\\\) for cart/checkout and 8/15 \\\\(ZAZ\\\\) and 8/31 \\\\(FRA\\\\) for identity. All the other marketplaces will remain in DUB until 2026, therefore this means the involved services will need to support traffic in DUB, ZAZ, and FRA during that period.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMany of our services are highly dependent on CORE team to run our fraud evaluations, we are working very closely with them to ensure their systems are ready by 6/15 \\\\(or earlier\\\\) to allow at least 6 weeks of service testing. We have agreed with CORE to replicate all the data in each region when necessary to avoid any fraud detection capabilities regression and only performing cross-region calls otherwise. If the BRP service is not latency sensitive, you can call CORE service or any other dependency not yet available on ZAZ/FRA with a cross region call which will add around 30ms with peaks of 65ms.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are working on a ML testing strategy to ensure that all the intents are well tested and have parity with current DUB performance before any traffic switch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Tech Strategy ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are working on a tech strategy document which will include BRP specific SOP to guide BRP service migration. We are currently reviewing the document with leadership and we will share it here when done. ETA 3/15.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Mitigation Strategies ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Risk 1: Resource and Sequencing Challenges\\\\*\\\\* BRP's Region Flexibility efforts can encounter risk due to overlapping priorities, competing initiatives, and peak workloads.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Risk 2: Data, Latency, and Model Performance Risks\\\\*\\\\* Decentralizing data and ML models across regions poses risks to fraud detection accuracy, latency, and data availability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Risk 3: External to BRP Dependency Risks\\\\*\\\\* BRP's success depends on robust mechanisms to monitor dependencies, escalate risks, and maintain alignment with teams like CARML and URES.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Key Points of Contact ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:942px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\\\\\n|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 163px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)Role Area|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 157px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)Overall BRP|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 130px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)Payment Risk|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 178px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)Account Integrity|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 127px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)Buyer Abuse|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 127px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)ML|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 119px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)CORE\\\\\\\\n|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:163px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*STL\\\\*\\\\*|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:157px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)psperez@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:130px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)psperez@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:178px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)shisrame@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)psperez@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)planfeng@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:119px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)prdeepn@\\\\\\\\n|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:163px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*Tech\\\\*\\\\*|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:157px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)gabeprz@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:130px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)ritikaj@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:178px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)bradcamp@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)torbettp@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)chienluc@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:119px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)prdeepn@\\\\\\\\n|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:163px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*Senior Leadership\\\\*\\\\*|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:157px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)ujjwalm@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:130px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)rajks@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:178px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)ajat@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)mrbohl@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)xiaohus@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:119px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)gddesai@\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Office Hours ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have weekly BRP Region Flexibility office hours with our Sr SDEs and ML PoCs.

Remote teams and complex distributed systems combined with the increase need for frequent releases mean an organization and its systems need to be more resilient than ever. As with security at AWS, ownership of resilience falls under a shared responsibility model: AWS is responsible for resilience of the cloud, while customers are responsible for resilience of their workloads in the cloud. Customers globally have asked AWS to help reduce the burden on them to meet their resilience in the cloud responsibilities with a standardized framework with actionable roadmaps they can phase into their unique AWS environments. We will soon launch a\\\\[\\\\[ Resilience Competency Program>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AWS/APN\\\\_Cloud\\\\_Foundations/Resilience\\\\]\\\\] \\\\(AWS internal wiki link\\\\) that will help Partners market and differentiate their business to AWS customers by showcasing their skills in this specialized area. Attaining an AWS Competency will help services path and software path Partners market and differentiate their business to AWS customers by showcasing their skills in this specialized area. Partners can apply to one or more of the following categories 1/ Highly Available and Resilient Architecture Design \\\\(Services Path\\\\), 2/ Resilient Application Design and Development \\\\(Services Path\\\\), 3/ Chaos Engineering and Resilience Testing \\\\(Software and Services Path\\\\), 4/ 24X7 Observability and Monitoring \\\\(Software and Services Path\\\\), 5/Operations and Incident management \\\\(Software and Services Path\\\\), 6/Business continuity and Disaster Recovery \\\\(Software and Services Path\\\\) and 7/ Core Resilience \\\\(Services Path\\\\). This Catalyst sprint provides an opportunity for select software and services path Partners to start/complete this designation prior to official public launch! Participation in this sprint will provide the partner with 1:1 enablement, support navigating the program, open up several GTM benefits, and set them up to be an early Resilience Competency Partner!

With a global recession looming, cost optimization is high on the agenda for the majority of our customers heading into 2023. Cost savings is more than dollars and cents. Cost optimization gives customers agility to \\\\(a\\\\) respond better to competition or disruption \\\\(e.g. an economic down turn\\\\) and can free up resources to invest back into their business to innovate faster or \\\\(b\\\\) scale fast and stay within budget on short-term projects. We are looking to Partner with motivated SI or MSP’s with existing Graviton Service Designations or those helping customers with optimization of their workloads.

Your customer could be: \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Migrating to a new instance generation \\\\(e.g. C5 → C6\\\\) or to a new architecture \\\\(e.g. x86 → Graviton-based instance\\\\) \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Migrating a mid-to-large scale workload from on-prem/another cloud provider to AWS or between regions \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Launching a new workload or expanding into a new AZ or region \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Experiencing business growth that is leading to accelerated usage and results in a new EC2 usage profile \\\\(e.g. growing from 10 instances per week to 100\\\\) \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Planning a one-time scale-up requirement \\\\(e.g. load testing, etc.\\\\)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis engagement playbook helps you help customers avoid experiencing challenges when pursuing their desired capacity. On the whole, customers will rarely experience insufficient capacity, and as you enable your customers on the following capacity and flexibility concepts, it is important to highlight to your customers that they will enhance their elasticity by tailoring their scaling strategies to their workloads. If their workload can tolerate multiple instance families across multiple AZs, only requesting one instance type or one AZ will naturally limit your customer’s maximum accessible capacity. AWS provides a ton of capacity; oftentimes the unnecessary limits of your customers’ inflexibility prematurely imposes a capacity challenge. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n=== Engagement Playbook Contents ===\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1.

Understand the customer’s workload requirements. Ask questions to understand the customer’s objectives and workload requirements. Whether a customer is planning a small or large-scale migration, it is important to understand their expectations on: instance types/sizes, quantity, preferred regions/AZs, purchasing models, usage pattern \\\\(steady-state or elastic\\\\), and timelines. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n11. Start with the Capacity Planning Qualification Guide\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n11. Here is the Accelerated Compute Qualification Guidance\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. \\\\*\\\\*Assess and educate on general EC2 capacity concepts and the Benefits of Flexibility.\\\\*\\\\* Part of the customer planning process is education. Customers do not always understand that they should consider balancing performance with availability. Though these are not mutually exclusive, there are times when pursuing the optimal instance for the workload my increase their likelihood of encountering insufficient capacity. To mitigate that risk, customers should consider how they can tap into more capacity pools while still prioritizing workload performance. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n=== EC2 Capacity Concepts ===\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*//Why do customers experience capacity challenges?//\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nCustomer’s sometimes, though rarely, experience insufficient capacity exceptions \\\\(ICE\\\\) because the demand for a given capacity pool may, albeit temporarily, exceed the available capacity in that pool. We purchase capacity based on customer demand for that capacity pool; the capacity planning team \\\\(CCX\\\\) models what they need based on historic pool utilization, and, combined with direct customer capacity signals \\\\(i.e., FOOB\\\\), procures capacity accordingly. Each capacity pool has different needs. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nDespite the low likelihood that your customers will encounter capacity difficulties, your customers need to build for resilience and elasticity. The more flexible customers are in the way they run workloads, the more likely they are to ensure application uptime and the less likely they are to encounter insufficient capacity exceptions \\\\(ICE\\\\). \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe provide the following capacity and flexibility concepts to help you understand how to equip your customers, but if I could distill capacity guidance down to a key concept, it mostly comes down to the “capacity pool”, i.e., a set of instances of a given type, within a particular region and Availability Zone. If your customer is ICE’ed, that means that one or a number of requested capacity pools did not have their desired capacity. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n==== Key EC2 capacity concepts: ====\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* \\\\*\\\\*Capacity Pool\\\\*\\\\* - a set of instances of a given type, within a particular region and Availability Zone\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\* Every instance type \\\\(e.g., r5.8xlarge, p3.2xlarge, etc.\\\\) and generation \\\\(e.g., c4 vs c5\\\\) across every AZ is its own capacity pool that is maintained independently. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\* Capacity pools fluctuate based on customer demand for that pool, and grows according to demand thresholds and forecasted organic growth. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\* Having flexibility to use multiple instance types and/or AZs expands the number of capacity pools available for your workload and improves likelihood that the customer’s capacity requirements will be consistently met.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* E.g., if an instance type is unavailable in one AZ, it could still be available in the other AZs within a given region.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* \\\\*\\\\*Capacity Management\\\\*\\\\* - For AWS, this means balancing supply and demand to ensure the optimal capacity pool usage \\\\(i.e., not overbuying or underbuying capacity for a given pool\\\\). For customers, this means efficiently adding and using EC2 capacity. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* \\\\[\\\\[\\\\(% class=\\\\\\\\\\\"wikiinternallink\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*FOOB or Assisted Capacity Reservation \\\\(ACR\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/EC2\\\\_Capacity\\\\_Planning/Customer\\\\_Planning\\\\_Group/Customer\\\\_Planning\\\\_Resources/AWS-Assisted\\\\_CR\\\\]\\\\]\\\\(%%\\\\) - FOOB stands for \\\\\\\\\\\"Future Out Of Band\\\\\\\\\\\" signal. FOOBs are used to communicate to EC2 that there is an emergent or spiky customer demand event that is not predicted by the past behavior of the customer.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* \\\\*\\\\*\\\\[\\\\[On-Demand Capacity Reservations \\\\(ODCR\\\\)>>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-reservations.html\\\\]\\\\] \\\\*\\\\*- ODCRs enable you to reserve compute capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration. Capacity Reservations mitigate against the risk of not getting On-Demand capacity in the rare chance that capacity is not available. If you have very strict capacity requirements and are running a business critical workload, either long term or short, we recommend that you create a capacity reservation to ensure you always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it, for as long as you need it.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n==== EC2 Flexibility Concepts ====\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n===== Benefits of Flexibility =====\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAs stated above, a customer is ICE’d when there is not enough capacity available in the requested capacity pool\\\\(s\\\\). The more capacity pools into which you can scale, the more likely you are to get what you request. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen booking a flight, you are less likely to get a seat if you are only willing to take 1A, or Row 1, or an exit row. Each time you widen the conditions, you expand your ability to get a seat on the plane. It’s also easier to book a flight if you’re willing to fly at lower demand dates and times. Each of these \\\\(e.g., seats, rows, dates/times, etc.\\\\) are variables you can adjust to increase your likelihood of getting a flight.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYour customers need to understand that part of building for resilience is optimizing for availability, i.e., enabling their application to use as many capacity pools as possible. This means adjusting instance type/family, AZs, and Regions \\\\(see “flexibility pyramid” below for simplicity\\\\). \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Key Benefits of having EC2 flexibility:\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Access to more capacity\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\* More instance types and more regions/AZs = more accessible capacity pools for the workload\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Better elasticity\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\* Ability to scale up and scale down without encountering insufficient capacity errors \\\\(ICEs\\\\), and improved price/performance benefits as customers more optimally manage their capacity with automated scaling functions \\\\(i.e., ASG, etc.\\\\)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Better balancing of price and performance\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\* Price benefits of On Demand \\\\(and Spot!\\\\): customers can continue to run their workloads on On Demand and even Spot as they introduce flexibility into their scaling practices. They don’t have to pay for what they don’t use by holding and/or reserving capacity to ensure they have it.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\* Reduced cost of waiting for capacity due to inflexibility\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nA simple way to identify your customers’ potential areas of improvement will be to walk them through the three principal categories of flexibility. If your customer can flex on even one of these categories they are likely to see marked improvement in their ability to obtain their needed capacity. The pyramid is not intended to be a sequential process, so much as to demonstrate three logical categories of variables customers have at their disposal to increase availability. The base of the pyramid simply shows the categories with the most variables, while the top has fewer levers to improve availability. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nKnowledge is Power!!!

You lower your risk through efficient diversification of assets. Similarly, your customers’ workloads have varying tolerance to performance/downtime on the one hand, and price on the other. Customers can reduce their price/downtime risk through diversification across instance types/family, geo, time, purchase options, reservations, etc. A lower risk workload can use EC2 Spot, for example, reducing their overall price, even as interruptions may reduce performance \\\\(i.e., lower potential uptime\\\\). Higher risk workloads, i.e., mission critical workloads, may be better served with On Demand Capacity Reservations \\\\(ODCRs\\\\), which increases the overall price to hold the instance, but reduces the risk of downtime \\\\(i.e., through ICEs\\\\). We try to detail a few common workloads you may face and provide high-level guidance on how to help customers mediate between price, performance and availability. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Spiky Workloads \\\\(Embarrassingly Parallel\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe maximum amount of time a customer can run an instance 24/7 or 100% of the time \\\\(e.g., database workloads, etc.\\\\). A spiky workload is a workload that runs for multiple time durations that do not equal 100%. A VFX firm can run render workloads or allocate workstations, or perhaps an automotive company can run nightly autonomous vehicle software regression tests, for 10hrs/weekday totalling 50hrs/week \\\\(or 30% of the time\\\\). If a customer needs capacity assurance for these workloads \\\\(i.e., they won’t get ICE’d when they need to scale\\\\), AWS suggests obtaining an ODCR. This means you pay for 24/7 use when you only have 10/7 use. Assurance increases the cost of compute.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\\\"}\\n[1]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/FlexibleCompute/EC2CapacityGuidelinesAndBestPractices/CustomerEngagementPlaybook/\\\\\\\"\\n[2]: \\\\\\\"https://permissions.amazon.com/group.mhtml?group=cmrtint-team&group_type=ldap\\\\\\\"\\n[3]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/XWiki/jossaq\\\\\\\"\\n[4]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/FlexibleCompute/EC2CapacityGuidelinesAndBestPractices/CustomerEngagementPlaybook/?viewer=code&showlinenumbers=1\\\\\\\"\"},{\"url\":\"https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/844627?query=Region+Flexibility+benefits+cost+optimization+resilience+scaling&focus=title&match=Region+Flexibility%3A+Why%2C+when%2C+and+what+it+means+for+2024%2C+The+Edge%2C+ep+145\",\"displayTitle\":\"Region Flexibility: Why, when, and what it means for 2024, The Edge, ep 145\",\"domain\":\"broadcast\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1736981513000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":4,\"categoryList\":[\"The Edge\",\"Region Flexibility\"],\"body\":\"s some of the top asks that our engineers have about region flex, Lisa Tread. Thank you\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"for joining me today, Lisa. Why don't we start with an introduction about yourself? Sure. Uh My name\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"is Lisa. I am a principal engineer on region flexibility. I've been on the project about two years\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"and been at Amazon 11. Awesome and Reed, Dave Treadwell. I run the e-commerce Foundation team, ECF\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"team here at Amazon. I've been here about 6.5 years and have been working closely in the vicinity of\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"region flexibility for most of that time. Excellent. So to get started, Lisa, I'd love to hear\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"what's region flex all about. Why are we here? Region is all about how do we get Amazon to easily\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"move into new regions? Um Ideally, with minimal effort from service owners, we love to get to the\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"point where service owners don't even have to know what regions they're in, but that's a little ways\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"away. Um Right now, most teams outside of Aws are in 3 to 4 regions. And there's a lot of challenges\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"to getting into more easily, things like people managing their infrastructure by hand or their\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"configuration assuming. Well, this marketplace will always run here. So there's a lot of work we\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"have to do and capabilities we have to build. And that's kind of where the region flexibility team\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"comes in of how do we build the tools to make this easier for all of the teams across Amazon? That\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"does sound really awesome for our architecture. Uh But Tred, maybe you could talk about why is\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"region flex important for our customers and how come now? Sure, happy to do it. So region\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"flexibility is not a new concept for us. It's been with us for many years and what's happening is\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"that we are growing our retail business faster than any individual Aws region is growing. So it's\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"really important that to continue scaling our retail business at the pace, our customers are\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"demanding that we be able to take advantage of many different Aws regions that they're building\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"around the world, not just the three mega regions that we take advantage of today, but be able to\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"use more regions over time. In particular, we also expect to get some nice customer benefits. Things\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"like by running our services physically closer to customers, we should be able to improve the\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"customer latency in our shop app on the phone, on the desktop web experience, they should be able to\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"get a lot better by being closer to customers. I think we also have benefits in terms of\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"availability. If there was one Aws region, having problems being much more region flexible, we could\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"keep running the site at high availability. In spite of that kind of issue. Also, we last month had\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"prime day and as part of prime day, one of things we always face is at the end of each day, at\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"midnight. In their local time, customers order a ton of products. That's a huge order spike. And so\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"we have to provision each region they need for each marketplace to handle that massive spike. Well,\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"in the long run, I hope and expect that we can flexibly use our regions even within a day, such as\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"that huge order spike, we can actually spread across a bunch of different AWS regions which will\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"reduce our cost to serve. It will improve our resilience, improve our availability, ultimately\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"improve the customer experience. There's a whole lot of really good reasons why we need to be region\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"flexible. Well, I'd certainly love to stop worrying about that end of day or a spike at midnight on\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"those calls. Um Now you did mention the three mega regions that we're in. Does that mean that our\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"work is done after we're out of these mega regions or do we have more to go. No, we're in three mega\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"regions today. Dub I AD PDX. We've committed to get out of dub by end of 2026 and to get out of I AD\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"and PDX by end of 2029. But I expect that this need to be region flexible is going to be with us\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"forever. It's, it's a core capability that we're going to need. I expect we're going to be using it\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"over and over as Aws grows new regions, as customer demand moves into different places. So we really\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"need to build this capability such that our services can easily move between regions both in the\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"macro sense over the course of months as I talked about earlier, even within an individual day, I\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"want our services to be very flexible across the Aws regions that they're in. So we've got to have\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"this capability. Don't view the Dublin 2026 thing as a one time event, view it as we need to build\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"this capability. We're going to use a lot in the future. Got it. The other aspect there is actually\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"it's not just a lift and shift, we're not taking everything that's in dub and moving it somewhere\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"else. We actually have to get really smart about this that we're like. All right. Well, you know,\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"this part of our traffic goes to this region, this part goes to a different region. So we have to be\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"able to more flexibly use the regions, even with what we have today, I found that really helpful\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"when talking to developers in terms of reframing, this isn't lift and shift, this is split and get\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"smart about it. And this sounds pretty important. So how are you planning to set up the organization\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"for success here? Yeah, one step I took recently is to ask Rob Hansen who's been leading the team\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"for consumer resilience for several years very successfully. I asked him to become single threaded\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"specifically on the problem of region flexibility. And that's a statement of how important it is\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"that we're taking a very strong leader having focused just on this problem space. Additionally,\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"Chris, so one of our most tenured distinguished engineers at Amazon, I've asked him to become single\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"threaded focusing again just on this problem of region flexibility. So we've really tried to set up\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"the organization to have this focus. A team that's really in charge of helping other teams become\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"region flexible more easily. So lots of teams will need to do effort for it. But we've got this one,\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"single threaded team leaders focused on region flexibility. Awesome. Well, sounds like they have\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"their work cut out for them, but I'm sure they'll have a lot of fun if we seen over the last recent\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"years, what's come out of crete? So pivoting a little bit, there have been a few top questions on\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"engineers minds.

The company needed a solution for their Java and .Net applications that use various database engines running on Amazon EC2 instances.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\The company's requirements included implementing a Pilot Light or Warm/Standby scenario, keeping costs low, allowing for manual failover, and maintaining a Recovery Time Objective \\\\(RTO\\\\) and Recovery Point Objective \\\\(RPO\\\\) under 15 minutes. They also needed to avoid using public resources.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\To meet these requirements, the company designed a solution encompassing both failover and failback scenarios. The failover process uses AWS services like EventBridge, Lambda functions, and Jenkins pipelines to detect issues and initiate the failover. It includes manual approval steps and uses Route53 for traffic redirection. The failback process, which returns operations to the primary region, is initiated manually by an operator. It involves database synchronization, manual approval steps, and a careful process to switch back to the primary region.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\The company's approach demonstrates their commitment to business continuity and resilience. By tailoring the architecture to their specific needs, they've created a solution that not only meets their technical requirements but also aligns with their internal processes and operating model. This solution offers several benefits, including customizability, standardization across different technologies, achievement of the desired RPO and RTO, and cost optimization through the use of cloud-native services.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\[\\\\[Read the full article>>url:https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/how-an-insurance-company-implements-disaster-recovery-of-3-tier-applications/\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== TMEGS Customers Case Study ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n=== Sportradar delivers cloud-native OTT \\\\(over-the-top\\\\) on AWS ===\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\[\\\\[image:1732295849030-241.png||height=\\\\\\\\\\\"100\\\\\\\\\\\" width=\\\\\\\\\\\"600\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSportradar, a global sports technology company, has successfully transitioned its over-the-top \\\\(OTT\\\\) streaming service to a cloud-native architecture on Amazon Web Services \\\\(AWS\\\\). This transformation was driven by the need to meet growing demand for low-latency global streaming capabilities, high availability, scalability and resiliency needs of their customers.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Key points:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Sportradar's migration to AWS occurred in two phases: first to a hybrid on-premises/AWS setup, then to a fully cloud-native AWS infrastructure. The move resulted in a 30% reduction in costs and improved availability through multi-availability zone redundancy.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Sportradar adopted a serverless cloud computing environment using services like AWS CloudFormation, Amazon ECS with AWS Fargate, and Amazon S3. Benefits of the cloud-native architecture include high scalability, flexibility to handle sudden traffic spikes, and improved performance.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Monitoring and observability were enhanced using Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon OpenSearch Service.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. The new setup allows Sportradar to stream both sporting events and non-sporting events like concerts with high quality and reliability.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. The migration has enabled Sportradar to meet the high availability, scalability, and resiliency needs of their customers in the fast-growing OTT services industry.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis case study demonstrates how AWS can help media companies modernize their streaming infrastructure to meet increasing demands in the OTT market.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[\\\\[Read the full case study>>url:https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/media/sportradar-delivers-cloud-native-ott-on-aws/\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Recent Resilience Blog Posts ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n=== Strengthen application resilience with myApplications and AWS Resilience Hub ===\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\[\\\\[image:1732295850535-558.png||height=\\\\\\\\\\\"720\\\\\\\\\\\" width=\\\\\\\\\\\"1280\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis blog post introduces the integration of AWS Resilience Hub with the myApplications feature in the AWS Management Console, offering a streamlined approach to managing and enhancing application resilience.

Remote teams and complex distributed systems combined with the increase need for frequent releases mean an organization and its systems need to be more resilient than ever. As with security at AWS, ownership of resilience falls under a shared responsibility model: AWS is responsible for resilience of the cloud, while customers are responsible for resilience of their workloads in the cloud. Customers globally have asked AWS to help reduce the burden on them to meet their resilience in the cloud responsibilities with a standardized framework with actionable roadmaps they can phase into their unique AWS environments.

Your customer could be: \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Migrating to a new instance generation \\\\(e.g. C5 → C6\\\\) or to a new architecture \\\\(e.g. x86 → Graviton-based instance\\\\) \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Migrating a mid-to-large scale workload from on-prem/another cloud provider to AWS or between regions \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Launching a new workload or expanding into a new AZ or region \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Experiencing business growth that is leading to accelerated usage and results in a new EC2 usage profile \\\\(e.g. growing from 10 instances per week to 100\\\\) \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Planning a one-time scale-up requirement \\\\(e.g. load testing, etc.\\\\)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis engagement playbook helps you help customers avoid experiencing challenges when pursuing their desired capacity. On the whole, customers will rarely experience insufficient capacity, and as you enable your customers on the following capacity and flexibility concepts, it is important to highlight to your customers that they will enhance their elasticity by tailoring their scaling strategies to their workloads. If their workload can tolerate multiple instance families across multiple AZs, only requesting one instance type or one AZ will naturally limit your customer’s maximum accessible capacity. AWS provides a ton of capacity; oftentimes the unnecessary limits of your customers’ inflexibility prematurely imposes a capacity challenge. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n=== Engagement Playbook Contents ===\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1.

Understand the customer’s workload requirements. Ask questions to understand the customer’s objectives and workload requirements. Whether a customer is planning a small or large-scale migration, it is important to understand their expectations on: instance types/sizes, quantity, preferred regions/AZs, purchasing models, usage pattern \\\\(steady-state or elastic\\\\), and timelines. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n11. Start with the Capacity Planning Qualification Guide\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n11. Here is the Accelerated Compute Qualification Guidance\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. \\\\*\\\\*Assess and educate on general EC2 capacity concepts and the Benefits of Flexibility.\\\\*\\\\* Part of the customer planning process is education. Customers do not always understand that they should consider balancing performance with availability. Though these are not mutually exclusive, there are times when pursuing the optimal instance for the workload my increase their likelihood of encountering insufficient capacity. To mitigate that risk, customers should consider how they can tap into more capacity pools while still prioritizing workload performance. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n=== EC2 Capacity Concepts ===\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*//Why do customers experience capacity challenges?//\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nCustomer’s sometimes, though rarely, experience insufficient capacity exceptions \\\\(ICE\\\\) because the demand for a given capacity pool may, albeit temporarily, exceed the available capacity in that pool. We purchase capacity based on customer demand for that capacity pool; the capacity planning team \\\\(CCX\\\\) models what they need based on historic pool utilization, and, combined with direct customer capacity signals \\\\(i.e., FOOB\\\\), procures capacity accordingly. Each capacity pool has different needs. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nDespite the low likelihood that your customers will encounter capacity difficulties, your customers need to build for resilience and elasticity. The more flexible customers are in the way they run workloads, the more likely they are to ensure application uptime and the less likely they are to encounter insufficient capacity exceptions \\\\(ICE\\\\). \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe provide the following capacity and flexibility concepts to help you understand how to equip your customers, but if I could distill capacity guidance down to a key concept, it mostly comes down to the “capacity pool”, i.e., a set of instances of a given type, within a particular region and Availability Zone. If your customer is ICE’ed, that means that one or a number of requested capacity pools did not have their desired capacity. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n==== Key EC2 capacity concepts: ====\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* \\\\*\\\\*Capacity Pool\\\\*\\\\* - a set of instances of a given type, within a particular region and Availability Zone\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\* Every instance type \\\\(e.g., r5.8xlarge, p3.2xlarge, etc.\\\\) and generation \\\\(e.g., c4 vs c5\\\\) across every AZ is its own capacity pool that is maintained independently. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\* Capacity pools fluctuate based on customer demand for that pool, and grows according to demand thresholds and forecasted organic growth. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\* Having flexibility to use multiple instance types and/or AZs expands the number of capacity pools available for your workload and improves likelihood that the customer’s capacity requirements will be consistently met.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* E.g., if an instance type is unavailable in one AZ, it could still be available in the other AZs within a given region.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* \\\\*\\\\*Capacity Management\\\\*\\\\* - For AWS, this means balancing supply and demand to ensure the optimal capacity pool usage \\\\(i.e., not overbuying or underbuying capacity for a given pool\\\\). For customers, this means efficiently adding and using EC2 capacity. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* \\\\[\\\\[\\\\(% class=\\\\\\\\\\\"wikiinternallink\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*FOOB or Assisted Capacity Reservation \\\\(ACR\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/EC2\\\\_Capacity\\\\_Planning/Customer\\\\_Planning\\\\_Group/Customer\\\\_Planning\\\\_Resources/AWS-Assisted\\\\_CR\\\\]\\\\]\\\\(%%\\\\) - FOOB stands for \\\\\\\\\\\"Future Out Of Band\\\\\\\\\\\" signal. FOOBs are used to communicate to EC2 that there is an emergent or spiky customer demand event that is not predicted by the past behavior of the customer.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* \\\\*\\\\*\\\\[\\\\[On-Demand Capacity Reservations \\\\(ODCR\\\\)>>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-reservations.html\\\\]\\\\] \\\\*\\\\*- ODCRs enable you to reserve compute capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration. Capacity Reservations mitigate against the risk of not getting On-Demand capacity in the rare chance that capacity is not available. If you have very strict capacity requirements and are running a business critical workload, either long term or short, we recommend that you create a capacity reservation to ensure you always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it, for as long as you need it.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n==== EC2 Flexibility Concepts ====\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n===== Benefits of Flexibility =====\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAs stated above, a customer is ICE’d when there is not enough capacity available in the requested capacity pool\\\\(s\\\\). The more capacity pools into which you can scale, the more likely you are to get what you request. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen booking a flight, you are less likely to get a seat if you are only willing to take 1A, or Row 1, or an exit row. Each time you widen the conditions, you expand your ability to get a seat on the plane. It’s also easier to book a flight if you’re willing to fly at lower demand dates and times. Each of these \\\\(e.g., seats, rows, dates/times, etc.\\\\) are variables you can adjust to increase your likelihood of getting a flight.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYour customers need to understand that part of building for resilience is optimizing for availability, i.e., enabling their application to use as many capacity pools as possible. This means adjusting instance type/family, AZs, and Regions \\\\(see “flexibility pyramid” below for simplicity\\\\). \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Key Benefits of having EC2 flexibility:\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Access to more capacity\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\* More instance types and more regions/AZs = more accessible capacity pools for the workload\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Better elasticity\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\* Ability to scale up and scale down without encountering insufficient capacity errors \\\\(ICEs\\\\), and improved price/performance benefits as customers more optimally manage their capacity with automated scaling functions \\\\(i.e., ASG, etc.\\\\)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Better balancing of price and performance\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\* Price benefits of On Demand \\\\(and Spot!\\\\): customers can continue to run their workloads on On Demand and even Spot as they introduce flexibility into their scaling practices. They don’t have to pay for what they don’t use by holding and/or reserving capacity to ensure they have it.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\* Reduced cost of waiting for capacity due to inflexibility\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nA simple way to identify your customers’ potential areas of improvement will be to walk them through the three principal categories of flexibility. If your customer can flex on even one of these categories they are likely to see marked improvement in their ability to obtain their needed capacity. The pyramid is not intended to be a sequential process, so much as to demonstrate three logical categories of variables customers have at their disposal to increase availability. The base of the pyramid simply shows the categories with the most variables, while the top has fewer levers to improve availability. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nKnowledge is Power!!!

You lower your risk through efficient diversification of assets. Similarly, your customers’ workloads have varying tolerance to performance/downtime on the one hand, and price on the other. Customers can reduce their price/downtime risk through diversification across instance types/family, geo, time, purchase options, reservations, etc. A lower risk workload can use EC2 Spot, for example, reducing their overall price, even as interruptions may reduce performance \\\\(i.e., lower potential uptime\\\\). Higher risk workloads, i.e., mission critical workloads, may be better served with On Demand Capacity Reservations \\\\(ODCRs\\\\), which increases the overall price to hold the instance, but reduces the risk of downtime \\\\(i.e., through ICEs\\\\). We try to detail a few common workloads you may face and provide high-level guidance on how to help customers mediate between price, performance and availability. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Spiky Workloads \\\\(Embarrassingly Parallel\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe maximum amount of time a customer can run an instance 24/7 or 100% of the time \\\\(e.g., database workloads, etc.\\\\). A spiky workload is a workload that runs for multiple time durations that do not equal 100%. A VFX firm can run render workloads or allocate workstations, or perhaps an automotive company can run nightly autonomous vehicle software regression tests, for 10hrs/weekday totalling 50hrs/week \\\\(or 30% of the time\\\\). If a customer needs capacity assurance for these workloads \\\\(i.e., they won’t get ICE’d when they need to scale\\\\), AWS suggests obtaining an ODCR. This means you pay for 24/7 use when you only have 10/7 use. Assurance increases the cost of compute.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\\\"}\\n[1]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/FlexibleCompute/EC2CapacityGuidelinesAndBestPractices/CustomerEngagementPlaybook/\\\\\\\"\\n[2]: \\\\\\\"https://permissions.amazon.com/group.mhtml?group=cmrtint-team&group_type=ldap\\\\\\\"\\n[3]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/XWiki/jossaq\\\\\\\"\\n[4]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/FlexibleCompute/EC2CapacityGuidelinesAndBestPractices/CustomerEngagementPlaybook/?viewer=code&showlinenumbers=1\\\\\\\"\"},{\"url\":\"https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/844627?query=Region+Flexibility+benefits+cost+optimization+resilience+scaling&focus=title&match=Region+Flexibility%3A+Why%2C+when%2C+and+what+it+means+for+2024%2C+The+Edge%2C+ep+145\",\"displayTitle\":\"Region Flexibility: Why, when, and what it means for 2024, The Edge, ep 145\",\"domain\":\"broadcast\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1736981513000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":4,\"categoryList\":[\"The Edge\",\"Region Flexibility\"],\"body\":\"s some of the top asks that our engineers have about region flex, Lisa Tread. Thank you\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"for joining me today, Lisa. Why don't we start with an introduction about yourself? Sure. Uh My name\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"is Lisa. I am a principal engineer on region flexibility. I've been on the project about two years\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"and been at Amazon 11. Awesome and Reed, Dave Treadwell. I run the e-commerce Foundation team, ECF\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"team here at Amazon. I've been here about 6.5 years and have been working closely in the vicinity of\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"region flexibility for most of that time. Excellent. So to get started, Lisa, I'd love to hear\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"what's region flex all about. Why are we here? Region is all about how do we get Amazon to easily\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"move into new regions? Um Ideally, with minimal effort from service owners, we love to get to the\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"point where service owners don't even have to know what regions they're in, but that's a little ways\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"away. Um Right now, most teams outside of Aws are in 3 to 4 regions. And there's a lot of challenges\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"to getting into more easily, things like people managing their infrastructure by hand or their\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"configuration assuming. Well, this marketplace will always run here. So there's a lot of work we\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"have to do and capabilities we have to build. And that's kind of where the region flexibility team\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"comes in of how do we build the tools to make this easier for all of the teams across Amazon? That\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"does sound really awesome for our architecture. Uh But Tred, maybe you could talk about why is\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"region flex important for our customers and how come now? Sure, happy to do it. So region\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"flexibility is not a new concept for us. It's been with us for many years and what's happening is\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"that we are growing our retail business faster than any individual Aws region is growing. So it's\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"really important that to continue scaling our retail business at the pace, our customers are\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"demanding that we be able to take advantage of many different Aws regions that they're building\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"around the world, not just the three mega regions that we take advantage of today, but be able to\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"use more regions over time. In particular, we also expect to get some nice customer benefits. Things\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"like by running our services physically closer to customers, we should be able to improve the\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"customer latency in our shop app on the phone, on the desktop web experience, they should be able to\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"get a lot better by being closer to customers. I think we also have benefits in terms of\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"availability. If there was one Aws region, having problems being much more region flexible, we could\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"keep running the site at high availability. In spite of that kind of issue. Also, we last month had\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"prime day and as part of prime day, one of things we always face is at the end of each day, at\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"midnight. In their local time, customers order a ton of products. That's a huge order spike. And so\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"we have to provision each region they need for each marketplace to handle that massive spike. Well,\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"in the long run, I hope and expect that we can flexibly use our regions even within a day, such as\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"that huge order spike, we can actually spread across a bunch of different AWS regions which will\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"reduce our cost to serve. It will improve our resilience, improve our availability, ultimately\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"improve the customer experience. There's a whole lot of really good reasons why we need to be region\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"flexible. Well, I'd certainly love to stop worrying about that end of day or a spike at midnight on\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"those calls. Um Now you did mention the three mega regions that we're in. Does that mean that our\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"work is done after we're out of these mega regions or do we have more to go. No, we're in three mega\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"regions today. Dub I AD PDX. We've committed to get out of dub by end of 2026 and to get out of I AD\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"and PDX by end of 2029. But I expect that this need to be region flexible is going to be with us\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"forever. It's, it's a core capability that we're going to need. I expect we're going to be using it\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"over and over as Aws grows new regions, as customer demand moves into different places. So we really\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"need to build this capability such that our services can easily move between regions both in the\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"macro sense over the course of months as I talked about earlier, even within an individual day, I\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"want our services to be very flexible across the Aws regions that they're in. So we've got to have\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"this capability. Don't view the Dublin 2026 thing as a one time event, view it as we need to build\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"this capability. We're going to use a lot in the future. Got it. The other aspect there is actually\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"it's not just a lift and shift, we're not taking everything that's in dub and moving it somewhere\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"else. We actually have to get really smart about this that we're like. All right. Well, you know,\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"this part of our traffic goes to this region, this part goes to a different region. So we have to be\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"able to more flexibly use the regions, even with what we have today, I found that really helpful\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"when talking to developers in terms of reframing, this isn't lift and shift, this is split and get\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"smart about it. And this sounds pretty important. So how are you planning to set up the organization\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"for success here? Yeah, one step I took recently is to ask Rob Hansen who's been leading the team\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"for consumer resilience for several years very successfully. I asked him to become single threaded\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"specifically on the problem of region flexibility. And that's a statement of how important it is\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"that we're taking a very strong leader having focused just on this problem space. Additionally,\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"Chris, so one of our most tenured distinguished engineers at Amazon, I've asked him to become single\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"threaded focusing again just on this problem of region flexibility. So we've really tried to set up\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"the organization to have this focus. A team that's really in charge of helping other teams become\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"region flexible more easily. So lots of teams will need to do effort for it. But we've got this one,\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"single threaded team leaders focused on region flexibility. Awesome. Well, sounds like they have\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"their work cut out for them, but I'm sure they'll have a lot of fun if we seen over the last recent\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"years, what's come out of crete? So pivoting a little bit, there have been a few top questions on\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"engineers minds. One of them is, hey, what do I need to move in 2024 or even 2023. So, Lisa, maybe\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"you could talk about that a little bit. Yeah, we do actually have some teams moving right now.

The company needed a solution for their Java and .Net applications that use various database engines running on Amazon EC2 instances.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\The company's requirements included implementing a Pilot Light or Warm/Standby scenario, keeping costs low, allowing for manual failover, and maintaining a Recovery Time Objective \\\\(RTO\\\\) and Recovery Point Objective \\\\(RPO\\\\) under 15 minutes. They also needed to avoid using public resources.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\To meet these requirements, the company designed a solution encompassing both failover and failback scenarios. The failover process uses AWS services like EventBridge, Lambda functions, and Jenkins pipelines to detect issues and initiate the failover. It includes manual approval steps and uses Route53 for traffic redirection. The failback process, which returns operations to the primary region, is initiated manually by an operator. It involves database synchronization, manual approval steps, and a careful process to switch back to the primary region.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\The company's approach demonstrates their commitment to business continuity and resilience. By tailoring the architecture to their specific needs, they've created a solution that not only meets their technical requirements but also aligns with their internal processes and operating model. This solution offers several benefits, including customizability, standardization across different technologies, achievement of the desired RPO and RTO, and cost optimization through the use of cloud-native services.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\[\\\\[Read the full article>>url:https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/how-an-insurance-company-implements-disaster-recovery-of-3-tier-applications/\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== TMEGS Customers Case Study ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n=== Sportradar delivers cloud-native OTT \\\\(over-the-top\\\\) on AWS ===\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\[\\\\[image:1732295849030-241.png||height=\\\\\\\\\\\"100\\\\\\\\\\\" width=\\\\\\\\\\\"600\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSportradar, a global sports technology company, has successfully transitioned its over-the-top \\\\(OTT\\\\) streaming service to a cloud-native architecture on Amazon Web Services \\\\(AWS\\\\). This transformation was driven by the need to meet growing demand for low-latency global streaming capabilities, high availability, scalability and resiliency needs of their customers.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Key points:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Sportradar's migration to AWS occurred in two phases: first to a hybrid on-premises/AWS setup, then to a fully cloud-native AWS infrastructure. The move resulted in a 30% reduction in costs and improved availability through multi-availability zone redundancy.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Sportradar adopted a serverless cloud computing environment using services like AWS CloudFormation, Amazon ECS with AWS Fargate, and Amazon S3. Benefits of the cloud-native architecture include high scalability, flexibility to handle sudden traffic spikes, and improved performance.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Monitoring and observability were enhanced using Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon OpenSearch Service.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. The new setup allows Sportradar to stream both sporting events and non-sporting events like concerts with high quality and reliability.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. The migration has enabled Sportradar to meet the high availability, scalability, and resiliency needs of their customers in the fast-growing OTT services industry.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis case study demonstrates how AWS can help media companies modernize their streaming infrastructure to meet increasing demands in the OTT market.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[\\\\[Read the full case study>>url:https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/media/sportradar-delivers-cloud-native-ott-on-aws/\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Recent Resilience Blog Posts ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n=== Strengthen application resilience with myApplications and AWS Resilience Hub ===\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\[\\\\[image:1732295850535-558.png||height=\\\\\\\\\\\"720\\\\\\\\\\\" width=\\\\\\\\\\\"1280\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis blog post introduces the integration of AWS Resilience Hub with the myApplications feature in the AWS Management Console, offering a streamlined approach to managing and enhancing application resilience.

SDO’s growth in these regions has reached a point where we can no longer assume unconstrained growth in future years. Not addressing these constraints will result in business and customer impact for SDO such as pausing marketplace expansions, eliminating peak deal events, and hinder ability to execute emergent scaling due to unanticipated customer behavior. Based on the S-team alignment from Q4’23, SDO is now committed to fully exit DUB by the end of 2026 and PDX by the end of 2029, with per-year capacity reductions that meet AWS’ supportable footprint targets in these regions. This CCI is focused on leading SDO’s effort to fully Exit DUB. IAD and PDX capacity assurance efforts do not require CCI currently, but this stance will be evaluated on a yearly basis. In 2025, SDO aims to reduce its forecasted peak footprint in DUB by 40% through migrations and deprecations, including reductions in EC2 and non-EC2 capacity. All SDO services hosted in DUB must complete mandatory architecture upgrades that unblock and reduce effort of region migrations. Teams should also complete recommended architectural upgrades to improve its services region flexibility.

For Buyer Risk Prevention \\\\(BRP\\\\), in 2025 this involves migrating critical systems across Payment Risk, Account Integrity, and Abuse Prevention from DUB to new regions: Zaragoza \\\\(ZAZ\\\\) and Frankfurt \\\\(FRA\\\\) with the goal to fully exit DUB by 2026. The goal is to improve resilience, meet evolving regulatory requirements, and enhance customer experience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Program Goals and Timelines ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Goal 1: Be prod ready for sub-experience \\\\(BRP is part of cart/checkout and identity\\\\) traffic migration\\\\*\\\\* by 7/31 \\\\(UK/SP marketplaces to ZAZ\\\\) and 8/15 \\\\(DE marketplace to FRA\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Goal 2: Achieve a 40% IMR costs Reduction in DUB\\\\*\\\\* by 10/16/2025. The bigger needle movers are the Bring Your Own Account fleets which have CORE owned service holding BRP data, we own those fleets for accounting purposes. We will also ensure that we leaving a manageable effort scope to fully exit DUB on 2026.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Migration Approach and Challenges ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRegion Flexibility team decided to perform the traffic switch in phases to reduce the complexity and risk by selecting sub-experiences \\\\(customer experience on Amazon web page that can be migrated mostly independently\\\\) and specific market places on 2025. BRP is only affected by cart/checkout and identity sub-experiences and we need to be ready for traffic switch by 7/31 \\\\(ZAZ\\\\) and 8/15 \\\\(FRA\\\\) for cart/checkout and 8/15 \\\\(ZAZ\\\\) and 8/31 \\\\(FRA\\\\) for identity. All the other marketplaces will remain in DUB until 2026, therefore this means the involved services will need to support traffic in DUB, ZAZ, and FRA during that period.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMany of our services are highly dependent on CORE team to run our fraud evaluations, we are working very closely with them to ensure their systems are ready by 6/15 \\\\(or earlier\\\\) to allow at least 6 weeks of service testing. We have agreed with CORE to replicate all the data in each region when necessary to avoid any fraud detection capabilities regression and only performing cross-region calls otherwise. If the BRP service is not latency sensitive, you can call CORE service or any other dependency not yet available on ZAZ/FRA with a cross region call which will add around 30ms with peaks of 65ms.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are working on a ML testing strategy to ensure that all the intents are well tested and have parity with current DUB performance before any traffic switch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Tech Strategy ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are working on a tech strategy document which will include BRP specific SOP to guide BRP service migration. We are currently reviewing the document with leadership and we will share it here when done. ETA 3/15.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Mitigation Strategies ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Risk 1: Resource and Sequencing Challenges\\\\*\\\\* BRP's Region Flexibility efforts can encounter risk due to overlapping priorities, competing initiatives, and peak workloads.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Risk 2: Data, Latency, and Model Performance Risks\\\\*\\\\* Decentralizing data and ML models across regions poses risks to fraud detection accuracy, latency, and data availability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Risk 3: External to BRP Dependency Risks\\\\*\\\\* BRP's success depends on robust mechanisms to monitor dependencies, escalate risks, and maintain alignment with teams like CARML and URES.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Key Points of Contact ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:942px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\\\\\n|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 163px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)Role Area|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 157px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)Overall BRP|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 130px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)Payment Risk|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 178px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)Account Integrity|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 127px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)Buyer Abuse|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 127px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)ML|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 119px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)CORE\\\\\\\\n|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:163px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*STL\\\\*\\\\*|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:157px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)psperez@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:130px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)psperez@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:178px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)shisrame@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)psperez@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)planfeng@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:119px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)prdeepn@\\\\\\\\n|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:163px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*Tech\\\\*\\\\*|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:157px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)gabeprz@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:130px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)ritikaj@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:178px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)bradcamp@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)torbettp@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)chienluc@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:119px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)prdeepn@\\\\\\\\n|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:163px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*Senior Leadership\\\\*\\\\*|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:157px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)ujjwalm@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:130px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)rajks@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:178px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)ajat@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)mrbohl@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)xiaohus@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:119px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)gddesai@\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Office Hours ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have weekly BRP Region Flexibility office hours with our Sr SDEs and ML PoCs.

\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n [Show line numbers][5]\\\\\\\\n == Summary ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAmazon’s SDO \\\\(Stores, Devices, and Other\\\\) Organization is running programs like \\\\[\\\\[Regional Flexibility>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility\\\\]\\\\], and \\\\[\\\\[Diversify AWS Region Usage \\\\(DARU\\\\)>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CloudTune/CapacityManagementPlanning/Programs/SDODiversifyAWSRegionUsage/\\\\]\\\\] to enable SDO’s business to operate outside of our existing Retail “mega-regions” of IAD, DUB and PDX. It will enable the movement of traffic across AWS regions for the purposes of cost-efficiency, availability, change in legal compliance requirements, etc. SDO has committed to moving 100% of capacity usage out of DUB \\\\(eu-west-1\\\\) by the end of 2026 in order to support AWS strategic goals outlined in the DARU program.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Amazon Payments provides the services and integrations points for payment experiences across SDO, AWS, and subsidiaries. These experiences include calls where transactional data correctness and latency are required to support our clients customer experience.\\\\\\\\nThis document provides strategies that are specific to the challenges AP faces when migrating regions or operating concurrently across regions, and referencing centrally provided guidance from RFE.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Program Goal ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy 10/31/2025, Payments have reduced server usage in DUB by 40% from the baseline established by RFE. There are 2 sub-goals \\\\(1\\\\) For services supporting checkout use-cases, be production ready in ZAZ by 6/30 and FRA by 8/30 \\\\(2\\\\) Services moving from DUB to ZAZ are migrated by 10/30/2025.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis goal is complete when:\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Measure 1: \\\\*\\\\*Specific critical calling paths required to support the migrated Checkout marketplaces have minimum TM99 latency regression \\\\(we will work with Checkout to define the acceptable latency regression\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Measure 2:\\\\*\\\\* Server usage in DUB is reduced by 40% as measured against forecast footprint published by RFE.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Tenets ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\* \\\\*\\\\*Embrace Architectural Flexibility:\\\\*\\\\* We design our systems to easily adapt and scale across new regions, eliminating rigid patterns or concepts that hinder agile expansion.\\\\\\\\n\\\\* \\\\*\\\\*Minimize Client Disruption:\\\\*\\\\* We strive to avoid requiring clients to update beyond merging from the live environment, ensuring seamless transitions. We will not be changing of the payments transactional data consistency model as a primary mechanism of achieving the migration and mitigating latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\* \\\\*\\\\*Optimize for Low Latency:\\\\*\\\\* We prioritize delivering exceptional customer experiences by architecting our solutions to minimize latency. We accept that some latency increase will occur, but customer perceived latency is our primary metric in measuring the impact.

The Region Flexibility Engineering \\\\(RFE\\\\) organization is providing tooling and general guidance to teams to assist in the migration out of these regions and into new ones, as well as driving and coordinating campaigns to make services more region flexible. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis wiki is intended to supplement existing Region Flexibility guidance and documentation by providing SPS builders more specific resources and opinionated guidance both for short-term mitigations and for long-term flexibility.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Exiting DUB ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe capacity constraints in DUB are the most pressing. Datacenter electricity usage in Ireland \\\\[\\\\[exceeded 14% of all usage in 2022>>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61308747\\\\]\\\\] and the local utility has \\\\[\\\\[imposed a moratorium on datacenter expansion through 2028>>https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/06/17/up-to-82-data-centres-operating-in-republic\\\\]\\\\]. To ensure that SDO continues to have capacity to grow and to not impact other AWS customers in the region, SDO is now committed to fully exit DUB by the end of 2026. \\\\[\\\\[In 2025, SPS will take a 40% DUB capacity reduction goal>>SPS-RegionFlex.Yearly.2025\\\\]\\\\].\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo meet this 2025 goal, SPS will establish new regional instances of 1\\\\) services that are dependencies of retail sub-experiences \\\\(Checkout\\\\), 2\\\\) services that constitute 80% of SPS DUB IMR, and 3\\\\)  partner-facing Mons and SP-API applications. Each of these services will migrate relevant data and traffic to ZAZ, FRA, or both according to their \\\\[\\\\[routing strategy>>SPS-RegionFlex.RoutingStrategies\\\\]\\\\]. In 2026, SPS will complete our migration out of DUB by establishing remaining services in ZAZ and FRA, migrating remaining data out of DUB, and establishing at least a subset of services to HYD.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Other Initiatives ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn addition to exiting DUB, SDO will need to eventually exit IAD and PDX regions. IAD will primarily require SDO services to migrate from existing AZs to new, “Holiday” AZs that are more distant than existing AZs and have higher latency. The first “Holiday” AZs will become available in 2025 and specific fleets have been contacted to migrate. SPS teams should expect to begin migrating in 2026. Migrating to the new AZs will be significantly less effort than migrating to a new region, however there is still manual work required.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe RFE team is currently considering what regions will be made available to replace PDX. Selling Partner customers would benefit from new regions being located in southeast Asia, where the majority of Selling Partners are based. We will continue to advocate that the RFE team choose regions that offer benefit to our customers while also solving capacity constraints. We currently do not have even soft commitments on new region launches after 2025 and only know ZAZ, FRA, and IAD \\\\(Holiday\\\\) will be available long-term. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe below table is constructed using both the RFE team's roadmap for SDO foundational services \\\\(communicated in MBR\\\\) and the \\\\[\\\\[DARU program's timeline>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CloudTune/CapacityManagementPlanning/Programs/SDODiversifyAWSRegionUsage/\\\\]\\\\] for capacity reduction.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\[\\\\[image:region-guidance-table.png||width=\\\\\\\\\\\"100%\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Mental Model ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRegions mitigate a fundamental problem in computation, which is that distance generates latency. By collocating our services in regions, we can rely on a low-latency, consistent, and reliable network. Communication between regions occurs over large distances and across multiple network providers, meaning orders of magnitude higher latency, low consistency of that latency, much lower reliability, and significantly higher costs. Software that can rely on intra-region communication is simpler to develop, easier to maintain, cheaper to run, and provides a better customer experience. Services are best deployed to multiple regions and interact with other services only within the same region.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAWS currently offers 31 geographically dispersed and fault-isolated AWS regions across two AWS partitions \\\\(‘aws’ and ‘aws-cn’\\\\). However, only four of these regions have SDO-foundational software, such as CloudAuth, Allegiance, or OPF. SPS services are generally deployed into at least one of the three ‘aws’ partition  regions: IAD \\\\(NA / us-east-1\\\\), DUB \\\\(EU / eu-west-1\\\\), and PDX \\\\(FE / us-west-2\\\\). RFE identifies these three regions as mega-regions. These mega-regions are fast approaching their physical capacity limits, and simply reducing each service’s footprint is not enough to ensure we have continued capacity for growth. To permanently reduce capacity in existing regions, services must be either turned off or migrated elsewhere. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo that end, the RFE team is driving the establishment of SDO-foundational software in additional regions. \\\\*\\\\*No single new region will exceed or even match the capacity in existing mega-regions\\\\*\\\\*, so instead of doing a lift and shift migration, SDO must adopt multiple new AWS regions for each existing mega-region. If we assume that DUB, IAD and PDX will each require at least two replacement regions, then SDO will likely need to adopt at least one new AWS regions each of the next 6 years. This means we need a consistent, repeatable strategy along with automation that is integrated into our existing tooling and frameworks.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nServices at Amazon utilize a \\\\[\\\\[routing strategy>>SPS-RegionFlex.RoutingStrategies\\\\]\\\\] to determine where a request can be processed efficiently and where data is stored. Service owners may not even know which strategy they use - most services are routed implicitly by relying on utilizing services in the same region for any given request. However, the routing strategy informs a service which regions it must utilize and when, where data must be available, and how to coordinate with consumers and dependencies. It is important that services utilize a relatively small set of routing strategies to increase in-region service alignment and reduce complexity when communicating with other services. Service owners must start by identifying and formalizing their service's choice of routing strategy in order to plan migrations. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== How can I stay connected or get help? ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Watch out for emailed flashes and updates from \\\\[\\\\[wwsps-regionflexibility-core@amazon.com>>https://email-list.corp.amazon.com/email-list/expand-list/wwsps-regionflexibility-core\\\\]\\\\] \\\\(pre-subscribed\\\\)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Join the SDO-wide Region Flex Slack channel \\\\(\\\\[\\\\[#region-flex-2024>>https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C05D7C8PVDY\\\\]\\\\]\\\\)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Join the SPS-specific Region Flex Slack channel \\\\(\\\\[\\\\[#sps-region-flex>>https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C06NN8Q8V9R\\\\]\\\\]\\\\)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Contact your nearest \\\\[\\\\[SPS Region Flex SPOC>>SPS-RegionFlex.Contact.WebHome||anchor=\\\\\\\\\\\"HSPSRegionFlexSPOCs\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Contact \\\\(or join\\\\) the \\\\[\\\\[SPS Region Flex Working Group>>SPS-RegionFlex.Contact.WebHome||anchor=\\\\\\\\\\\"HSPSRegionFlexWorkingGroup\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\"}\\n[1]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/SPS-RegionFlex/\\\\\\\"\\n[2]: \\\\\\\"https://permissions.amazon.com/group.mhtml?group=wwsps-regionflexibility-wg&group_type=ldap\\\\\\\"\\n[3]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/XWiki/briahenk\\\\\\\"\\n[4]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/SPS-RegionFlex/?viewer=code&showlinenumbers=1\\\\\\\"\"},{\"url\":\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Campaigns/search_all_robot_traffic_es_uk_zaz/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Search Region Flex Exit-DUB Policy Engine Campaign\",\"domain\":\"wiki\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1736382135000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":6,\"categoryList\":[\"Quip2Wiki\",\"Quip2Wiki:xhtml\"],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n                    \\\\\\\\n      # Wiki source code of [Search Region Flex Exit-DUB Policy Engine Campaign][1]\\n\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\n              **Primary Owner **[ region-flexibility-engineering-all \\\\(LDAP\\\\) ][2]\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\n                                                                      \\\\\\\\n        Last modified 7 months ago by [jiayaj][3].\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n---\\n\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  [Show line numbers][4]\\\\\\\\n  <!-- \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    DO NOT change the content of this Wiki\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    The content of this Wiki page was generated by Quip2Wiki tool from a Quip document, so any change using Wiki editor can be lost when new updates from Quip2Wiki are submitted.\\\\\\\\n    Please consider changing the original Quip document at https://quip-amazon.com/IpcbAJ91T4lg\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n -->\\\\\\\\n<html>\\\\\\\\n<body>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<div class='hidden-print'>\\\\\\\\n<p><i style='color:#888888; font-size:small;'>This page was created by <a href=\\\\\\\\\\\"/bin/view/Quip2Wiki\\\\\\\\\\\">Quip2Wiki</a> from a Quip document \\\\(<a href=\\\\\\\\\\\"https://quip-amazon.com/IpcbAJ91T4lg\\\\\\\\\\\">See original</a>\\\\) at 'Thu, 09 Jan 2025 00:22:14 GMT'</i></p>\\\\\\\\n<hr/>\\\\\\\\n</div>\\\\\\\\n<h2><b>Intro</b></h2>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>SDO must fully exit the DUB region by end of 2026, and in support of this requirement Amazon Search is migrating its workload serving retail search pages for the UK, ES and IN marketplaces from DUB to ZAZ region, and the DE marketplace from DUB to FRA region in 2025. </p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>Your service has been identified as a critical dependency of Search systems covered by these migrations.

SDO’s growth in these regions has reached a point where we can no longer assume unconstrained growth in future years. Capacity constraints began to impact SDO’s ability to increase capacity demand in 2023, with anticipated shortfalls through 2030. </p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>SDO is committed to fully exiting from DUB by the end of 2026, and targets to achieve a 40% server count reduction in DUB by October 1, 2025. In 2025, SDO will migrate customer-facing experiences and marketplaces from DUB to the target AWS regions including ZAZ \\\\(eu-south-2/Zaragoza\\\\) and FRA \\\\(eu-central-1/Frankfurt\\\\). Aligned with SDO's strategy to exit DUB, Search will fully migrate UK/ES/IN marketplaces from DUB to ZAZ and DE marketplace to FRA.</p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>To scale this migration effort, RFE is leveraging Policy Engine \\\\(PE\\\\) campaigns to proactively notify teams that their pipelines have been identified as dependencies for specific sub-experience migration plans.

It attempts to address common questions and presents high level migration strategy for migrating the services out of DUB. Objective of the document is to a\\\\) socialize the DARU goal and RFE guidance for 2025, b\\\\) review and guide the IESP Teams to meet their DUB reduction targets at L7 orgs. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== What is DARU 2025 goal? Why is this goal important? ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn 2025, DARU has set 2025 goal to reduce Q4'25 forecasted SDO footprint by 40% through service migrations and deprecations out of DUB region. This corresponds to IESP responsibility of 544 server migrations out of DUB region in 2025.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNot addressing the capacity constraints will result in business and customer impact for SDO such as pausing marketplace expansions, eliminating peak deal events, and hinder ability to execute emergent scaling due to unanticipated customer behaviour. Improving architecture flexibility and migrating to non-concentrated AWS regions results in benefits such as: \\\\(1\\\\) Reduced IMR - IMR for foundational services in destination regions is ~~30-35% cheaper compared to DUB; \\\\(2\\\\) Improving latency for end-users by moving workloads closer to where customers are located; \\\\(3\\\\) Minimized impact of capacity constraints; \\\\(4\\\\) Faster response to data compliance regulation.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== What is the execution strategy to meet 2025 goal for IESP? ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, we plan to start by moving the systems that can move relatively independently - things like ML training, async services, internal tooling, non-EC2 instances or small clusters of services connected to each other but minimally connected back to the “big ball of services”. Wherever we can, we'll find groups of systems that can be moved to a new region independently. Teams can help by identifying parts that have low latency requirements \\\\(high timeouts or async\\\\). Cross-region traffic in the steady-state will be monitored, managed, and optimized to ensure the impact to our customers are well understood. Wherever possible, we prefer services that have large footprints that meet this criteria.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe recommend migrating to ZAZ unless there are specific reasons \\\\(like Compliance, cross-region latency impact etc.\\\\) not to do so. BOM or HYD migrations would require PE review \\\\(\\\\[\\\\[Jenny Shah>>https://phonetool.amazon.com/users/jennysha\\\\]\\\\]\\\\). Since Checkout migration as a sub-experience is planned in 2026 for IN traffic, the teams are requested to defer the migration of all the Retail Checkout-related latency sensitive services to 2026. Non-Retail Checkout service migrations can continue as per plan. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Details of migration tools ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% cellspacing=\\\\\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\\\\\" class=\\\\\\\\\\\"MsoTable15Grid1LightAccent1\\\\\\\\\\\" style=\\\\\\\\\\\"border-collapse:collapse; border:none\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\\\\\n|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"background-color:black; background:black; border-style:solid; border-width:1.0pt; width:117.0pt\\\\\\\\\\\" width=\\\\\\\\\\\"156\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\(\\\\(\\\\(\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"margin-bottom:0in; padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"background-color:black; color:#ffffff; font-size:8pt; line-height:normal\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*Tool Name\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\n\\\\)\\\\)\\\\)|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"background-color:black; background:black; border-left:none; border-style:solid; border-width:1.0pt; width:117.0pt\\\\\\\\\\\" width=\\\\\\\\\\\"156\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\(\\\\(\\\\(\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"margin-bottom:0in; padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"background-color:black; color:white; font-size:8pt; line-height:normal\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*Tool Description\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\n\\\\)\\\\)\\\\)|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"background-color:black; background:black; border-left:none; border-style:solid; border-width:1.0pt; width:117.0pt\\\\\\\\\\\" width=\\\\\\\\\\\"156\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\(\\\\(\\\\(\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"margin-bottom:0in; padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"background-color:black; color:white; font-size:8pt; line-height:normal\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*Tool link\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\n\\\\)\\\\)\\\\)|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"background-color:black; background:black; border-left:none; border-style:solid; border-width:1.0pt; width:117.0pt\\\\\\\\\\\" width=\\\\\\\\\\\"156\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\(\\\\(\\\\(\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"margin-bottom:0in; padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"background-color:black; color:white; font-size:8pt; line-height:normal\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*Comment\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\n\\\\)\\\\)\\\\)\\\\\\\\n|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"border-style:solid; border-top:none; border-width:1.0pt; width:117.0pt\\\\\\\\\\\" width=\\\\\\\\\\\"1\"},{\"url\":\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/IN-Region-Flexibility/\",\"displayTitle\":\"IN Region Flexibility\",\"domain\":\"wiki\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1740419757000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":8,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n                    \\\\\\\\n      # Wiki source code of [IN Region Flexibility][1]\\n\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\n              **Primary Owner **[ in-region-flexibility \\\\(LDAP\\\\) ][2]\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\n                                                                      \\\\\\\\n        Last modified 5 months ago by [paparaoc][3].\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n---\\n\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  [Show line numbers][4]\\\\\\\\n  {{transclude name=\\\\\\\\\\\"INRegionFlexibility\\\\\\\\\\\"/}}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n{{comment}}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  The template for the IN Regional Flexibility wiki can be found at https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Templates/INRegionFlexibility/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n{{/comment}}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n{{container cssClass=\\\\\\\\\\\"floatinginfobox\\\\\\\\\\\"}}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% border=\\\\\\\\\\\"1\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"border-right:2.5px solid #00004d; border-left:2.5px solid #00004d; padding-right:25px; padding-left:25px; width:30%\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\(\\\\(\\\\(\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n{{toc/}}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Problem Scope ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOver the next 18-24 months the Stores, Devices, and Other \\\\(SDO\\\\) organization will move 25%+ of our OLTP data across AWS regions to provide operational flexibility and overcome scaling constraints for our existing and new marketplace expansion. Region flexibility is an SDO led initiative aimed at simplifying the efforts to get SDO services rapidly into new or existing AWS regions to address operational and regulatory challenges. Since 2020, SDO has been investing in components of regional flexibility by enabling technologies: Service Configuration Discovery and Routing \\\\(Axon, Almanac, Veritas, Planisphere, others\\\\), Data analysis \\\\(Metador, Andes, others\\\\) and movement \\\\(Hotwire/LMT, GlobeMaster, CDMS\\\\). While these investments allowed us to address specific pain points, Service/Application owners \\\\(Builders\\\\) are required to assemble these services to build out and execute a migration recipe that meets their need and addresses constraints. What is missing is a guided, friction-less customer experience or unified solution for Builders to orchestrate \\\\(fully/semi-automated or manual\\\\) migrations that addresses dependencies, run time latency needs, and shared data access constraints, while still keeping their business running.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAs an example, the Region Flexibility team may want to stand up \\\\(all\\\\) the necessary services for an experience in a new region, then migrate the data necessary for the experience incrementally and atomically \\\\(e.g. such that all the data for a specific customer appears in the new region together\\\\). This requires understanding the services' upstream and downstream dependencies, along with the computational views that the services consume. It also requires orchestrating data movement to aid functional debugging, validation, and auditing. Doing these migrations without coordination will be resource intensive for application owners and builders.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Our Vision ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nEnable SDO's businesses to operate outside of our existing \\\\\\\\\\\"mega-regions\\\\\\\\\\\" of IAD, DUB, and PDX; and enable the movement of traffic across AWS regions for the purposes of cost-efficiency, availability, change in legal compliance requirements etc. without effort from the service owner. The North Star for region flexibility is to centrally deploy services to new or expanding regions and move data and customer traffic between regions in a matter of months without negatively impacting service owners or customers. In short, most service owners should not need to know where their systems and data reside.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe IN Region Flexibility team's charter focuses on three core objectives: 1\\\\) Execute DARU S-Team Goal compliance and facilitate DUB exit for IES by EOY 2026; 2\\\\) Drive IES services to be 100% region flexible with optimal investments and overall org productivity enhancements; and 3\\\\) Develop robust region and data migration tooling via strategic collaboration with WW Region Flex Engineering \\\\(RFE\\\\) and Managed Migration Experience \\\\(M2X\\\\) organizations. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe IN Region Flexibility team owns UI console and Testing Framework in this initiative and is responsible for establishing new solutions and architectural patterns in these fields to help services owners get into regions more quickly, in partnership with different teams at Amazon.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Program Overview ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nhttps://w.amazon.com/bin/view/IN-Region-Flexibility/Overview/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Tenets ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\[TBD\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Architecture ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\[\\\\[image:https://maxis-file-service-prod-dub.dub.proxy.amazon.com/issues/cabe9f31-df17-4958-8ff5-d2aaa7c6e548/attachments/e693b07c32ba24ff14c5674857d1681c8cf20e973beca1924f7bc6db881c4c26\\\\_1b2ac41c-af1a-46f2-9b72-1b0990552717||width=\\\\\\\\\\\"50%\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Coordinator\\\\*\\\\* is an umbrella service which contains various different services/component. It is an orchestration service that delegates the entire migration process to various tools and components. These various tools and components will also depend on what type of migration a customer wants to perform.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*MetaDor\\\\*\\\\* is the the component that will power the discovery experience over the MetaData UI console. MetaDor will be the source of information for getting information required to enable migrations on service/dataset level. These informations will be used to prepare migration entity, MODs and MEDs.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*DRA\\\\*\\\\* is the component which will keep track of status of entities under migration and enable in routing traffic to proper region.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Data Movement Services\\\\*\\\\* is the component which will actually move the data, i.e, perform migration. It will also provide capabilities to Coordinator to start/stop/terminate migration at Dataset/service level. One of the example if this service is CDMS which is is a suite of data movement solutions for SDO data owners who need to move their data across AWS regions, partitions, accounts and storage technologies.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe detailed architecture for the entire Region Flexibility program can be found here

changes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCurrent State\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBelow is world map showing the distribution of current HBA stack software and countries/businesses supported:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe HBA full stack is made up of over 45 services, including candidate-facing websites, recruiter and other operational/admin portals, as well as backend systems like data sources and orchestrators. The HBA-Core is a minimalistic version of the full HBA stack, running a subset of just under 7 services:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCareerSite website \\\\(country-specific, can be in marketplace or isolated hiring mode\\\\)\\\\\\\\nJobContainer sourcing Salesforce jobs\\\\\\\\nCDS hosting candidate data\\\\\\\\nPACE website and checklist service augmenting the Salesforce hiring experience\\\\\\\\nCandidate Dashboard website\\\\\\\\nAuthPortal as a web portal and a backend Cognito-based service\\\\\\\\nGlobal contact us page and BFF\\\\\\\\nTo transition the HBA-Core stack to the full HBA stack, additional services \\\\(±30, excluding global services like RAMP and ROMP\\\\) would need to be added, such as:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAES and HFS orchestrators\\\\\\\\nCandidate-facing systems like PHO, Badge Photo, AVA\\\\\\\\nBackend services like ADS, HDE, JMS, JVS, CCS, Knowledge Base Store, Contact Channels, and Amazon Connect instance\\\\\\\\nRecruiter-facing systems like Template Management, URI and Hubble reporting, LOMP, Control Center, JMP, Appointment Portal, CAMP, Admin Portal, Agent Desktop, and Bulk Ops\\\\\\\\nThe current HBA-Core infrastructure for India is deployed in the ap-south-2 AWS region.\\\\\\\\nProposal\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOption 1: Expand existing FRA \\\\(eu-central-1\\\\) HBA-Core into a full stack and migrate data from HYD/BOM\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith this option, we would use the India CS expansion as an opportunity to make the CS stack compliant with the DARU region flexibility goals. This would involve extending the existing HBA-Core services deployed in the eu-central-1 \\\\(FRA\\\\) region into a full HBA stack.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis requires deploying the remaining ~30 services that are currently missing from the HBA-Core stack, such as the AES and HFS orchestrators, candidate-facing systems, backend services, and recruiter-facing portals. Additionally, we would need to migrate the existing data that is currently stored in the CDS and AuthPortal components of the India HBA-Core stack deployed in ap-south-1 \\\\(BOM\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOverall, this option prioritizes compliance with the DARU goals, even if it means taking on more dev effort \\\\(±50 weeks of stack setup + 20 weeks for data migration\\\\) compared to other options. However, this does not mean HBA will be overal compliant with DARU guidance as it’s currently hosting 2 other stacks in eu-west-1 \\\\(1 full HBA running UK and India WFS hiring; 1 HBA-Core running UK and Ireland CS hiring\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that it’s easier to do a 1-time migration for all customers in DUB vs. doing it gradually per customer, with blast radius mitigated by the migration strategy adopted. More on this HVH Exit DUB Initiative \\\\(RFE/DARU\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPros:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAligns with the DARU region flexibility goals by not expanding the current volume of usage of DUB stack.\\\\\\\\nIncreases the operational overhead, as we would now have a full HBA stack running in the eu-central-1 region, in addition to the other HBA stacks running in different regions.\\\\\\\\nCons:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRequires additional development effort to deploy the new services and migrate the existing data.\\\\\\\\nRough estimate: 250 pipelines, 1 days of effort for each, ±50 additional weeks.\\\\\\\\nMigrating the Cognito-based AuthPortal may require users to reset their passwords, which needs to be aligned on with the business, or mitigated with extra dev effort on AuthPortal side to do Just-In-Time Migration of users. https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/approaches-for-migrating-users-to-amazon-cognito-user-pools/\\\\\\\\nDeploying India CS and India FC on different physical stacks creates data isolation, preventing a unified recruiter experience. This implementation would force recruiters to switch physical regions when managing different India lines of business, requiring context switching between two EU regions. Virtual regions concept cannot currently span countries or lines of business across different physical stacks, fragmenting the overall experience.\\\\\\\\nRequires additional effort to rebuild the SF-to-CDS sync on the FRA stack, currently established between SF and BOM region.\\\\\\\\nOption 2 \\\\[Preferred\\\\]: Migrate existing HYD/BOM HBA-Core to existing HBA full stack in DUB \\\\(eu-west-1\\\\)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith this option, we would reuse an existing DUB stack which is already proven to run multiple countries and modes of hiring \\\\(Isolated Agency Hiring and Marketplace Hiring\\\\). We would treat CS as another Isolated Hiring \\\\(ISO\\\\) running in parallel with Workforce Staffing \\\\(WFS\\\\) in the marketplace mode.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis option requires migrating the data from the CDS and AuthPortal components of the existing HBA-Core stack in BOM \\\\(ap-south-1\\\\) to the DUB \\\\(eu-west-1\\\\) stack. This means the business would need to weigh in on the impact to customers who may need to reset their passwords, as Cognito logins would need to be migrated, or accept additional dev effort and tech complexity to mitigate \\\\(more details below\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor the CareerSite, we could either keep the current websites in HYD or reconfigure the domain names to point to the CS in DUB. This decision is not a game-changer and can be finalized in the CS design doc. However, the CS BFF \\\\(Backend for Frontend\\\\) would need to point to the DUB stack.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPros:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLowest development effort, as it only involves the data migration, no new stack setup. Total effort estimated at 20 weeks.\\\\\\\\nAllows deprecation of existing HBA-Core India stack resulting in reduced operational burden for teams.\\\\\\\\nCons:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExpands the usage footprint of servers in DUB, which conflicts with the DARU initiative to exit the region by 2026. However, adding India CS to the existing DUB stack involves minimal migration effort, as the data resides in the same databases and uses existing compute infrastructure. The 2023-2025 hiring volumes \\\\(21,332 in 2023, 19,100 in 2024, ~7,000 in 2025\\\\) represent a manageable growth that marginally impacts server infrastructure or migration complexity.\\\\\\\\nIf we migrate and backfill candidate logins in Cognito, customers may have to reset their passwords. This needs discussion with the business. Can be mitigated with extra dev effort on AuthPortal side to do Just-In-Time Migration of users. https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/approaches-for-migrating-users-to-amazon-cognito-user-pools/. Same con with Option 1 above.\\\\\\\\nAn alternative approach to this problem is to keep the current Cognito stack for India CS candidates in the BOM \\\\(ap-south-2\\\\) stack, and make the AuthPortal service in DUB call the BOM Cognito, avoiding the need for data backfill and any impact on customer login experience. However this will introdcue more complexity in the application layer, and CDS and Auth will no longer maintain a 1:1 stack mapping. This solution while possible, is not recommended.\\\\\\\\nMigrating candidates from CDS BOM to DUB req\"},{\"url\":\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Users/yngluo/Quip/WikiPageDraft-2025GroceryExperienceExitDUBMigrationplan/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Wiki Page Draft - 2025 Grocery Experience Exit DUB Migration plan\",\"domain\":\"wiki\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1731977809000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":10,\"categoryList\":[\"Quip2Wiki\",\"Quip2Wiki:xhtml\"],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n                    \\\\\\\\n      # Wiki source code of [Wiki Page Draft - 2025 Grocery Experience Exit DUB Migration plan][1]\\n\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\n                        **Primary Contact **[yngluo \\\\(user\\\\)][2]_[ How do I change this value?][3]_\\\\\\\\n                  \\\\\\\\n                                                                      \\\\\\\\n        Last modified 8 months ago by [yngluo][4].\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n---\\n\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  [Show line numbers][5]\\\\\\\\n  <!-- \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    DO NOT change the content of this Wiki\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    The content of this Wiki page was generated by Quip2Wiki tool from a Quip document, so any change using Wiki editor can be lost when new updates from Quip2Wiki are submitted.\\\\\\\\n    Please consider changing the original Quip document at https://quip-amazon.com/yT5cA6uXLDV7\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n -->\\\\\\\\n<html>\\\\\\\\n<body>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<div class='hidden-print'>\\\\\\\\n<p><i style='color:#888888; font-size:small;'>This page was created by <a href=\\\\\\\\\\\"/bin/view/Quip2Wiki\\\\\\\\\\\">Quip2Wiki</a> from a Quip document \\\\(<a href=\\\\\\\\\\\"https://quip-amazon.com/yT5cA6uXLDV7\\\\\\\\\\\">See original</a>\\\\) at 'Tue, 19 Nov 2024 00:56:48 GMT'</i></p>\\\\\\\\n<hr/>\\\\\\\\n</div>\\\\\\\\n<h2><b>Summary</b></h2>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>Amazon’s SDO \\\\(Stores, Devices, and Other\\\\) Organization is running programs like <a href=\\\\\\\\\\\"/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility\\\\\\\\\\\">Regional Flexibility</a>, and <a href=\\\\\\\\\\\"/bin/view/CloudTune/CapacityManagementPlanning/Programs/SDODiversifyAWSRegionUsage/\\\\\\\\\\\">Diversify AWS Region Usage \\\\(DARU\\\\)</a> to enable SDO’s business to operate outside of our existing Retail “mega-regions” of IAD, DUB and PDX.

Migration Strategy </h2>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>We can satisfy 2025 requirements entirely through sub-experience migrations \\\\(i.e. migrating pipelines supporting experiences that are not used by external Amazon customers\\\\). While the breakdown is not going to necessarily by 40% across all leaders for 2025, leaders should know that migrations should be completed by the end of 2026. This means that extra effort for one leader’s org in 2025 means less effort in 2026, and vice versa.</p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>Sub-experiences should be assessed by service owners to validate whether or not they are sensitive to additional latency. For example, if a particular service is particularly chatty on the network, it likely should migrate with its up- or down-streams in order to prevent significant degradation in performance and IMR. To help assess this, the <a href=\\\\\\\\\\\"https://axon.ops.amazon.dev/service-graph\\\\\\\\\\\">Axon team has provided a service graph analysis</a>, including upstream and downstream traffic metrics for each service over a requested period. </p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>Ideally, we can choose in-scope services by ranking services by the highest Server Count and the lowest in/out call counts in order to satisfy the 2025 requirement to cut 40% of server utilization as this is a good proxy for effort ROI assuming 10 SDE weeks of effort per pipeline. However, service owners should assess whether or not their actual service will take more or less than the “average” 10 SDE-week effort.</p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<ul><li value='1'><span><b>Migration Process Risks</b></span>\\\\\\\\n<ul><li><span>What mechanisms the sub-experience will use to identify timeline risks and ensure <a href=\\\\\\\\\\\"https://wiki.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Tech\\\\_Guidance/Deep\\\\_Dives\\\\_and\\\\_Announcements/Announcements/Exit\\\\_DUB\\\\_Strategy#HWhatarethecurrentidentifiedSDOsub-experiences3F\\\\\\\\\\\">timelines for Experience migrations</a> are met.</span></li>\\\\\\\\n<li><span><a href=\\\\\\\\\\\"https://axon.ops.amazon.dev/service-graph\\\\\\\\\\\">Identify dependency graphs of pipelines/services</a> to find “groups” of services that should be migrated together to reduce latency impacts across service groups.</span></li>\\\\\\\\n<li><span>Throw-away work if services are later marked for deprecation as part of core convergence roadmaps. To mitigate this, services that are “hotly-debated” for deprecation as part of core convergence should be excluded from services for 2025 migration as they may be deprecated by the end of 2026.</span></li>\\\\\\\\n</ul></li><li><span><b>Latency Impacts</b></span>\\\\\\\\n<ul><li><span><a href=\\\\\\\\\\\"/bin/view/Latency/Projects/Exemption\\\\_and\\\\_CommitmentTracker/User\\\\_Guide/\\\\\\\\\\\">Manage Latency Commitments</a>. Services particularly sensitive to latency are tracked in the latency portal. In 2025 we will focus on sub-experience migration that have the lowest latency impacts to the services listed on the portal \\\\(please see the <a href=\\\\\\\\\\\"https://axon.ops.amazon.dev/service-graph\\\\\\\\\\\">Service Graph</a> to help assess this\\\\). Extra care should be taken to identify services that support Product Search, Cart, or Product Detail Core Experiences \\\\(e.g. services that expose data to DataPath for use in AAPI\\\\).</span></li>\\\\\\\\n<li><span>It is estimated that cross-region calls add an additional latency of 30-35ms in the best case, and up to 65 ms in the worst case. If the migrating service is part of the service graph of a core experience in a way that may cause a latency commitment breach, the migrating team should identify ways to reduce latency within the application by the same amount \\\\(~65ms\\\\) in order to provide a net-zero impact to latency post-migration.</span></li>\\\\\\\\n<li><span>Notification plan. If a Grocery sub-experience is identified as a root-cause for latency degradation of a core experience, the service owners will be notified.</span></li>\\\\\\\\n<li><span>Rollback plan.

SDO’s growth in these regions has reached a point where we can no longer assume unconstrained growth in future years.

Based on the S-team alignment from Q4’23, SDO is now committed to fully exit DUB by the end of 2026 and PDX by the end of 2029, with per-year capacity reductions that meet AWS’ supportable footprint targets in these regions. This CCI is focused on leading SDO’s effort to fully Exit DUB. IAD and PDX capacity assurance efforts do not require CCI currently, but this stance will be evaluated on a yearly basis. In 2025, SDO aims to reduce its forecasted peak footprint in DUB by 40% through migrations and deprecations, including reductions in EC2 and non-EC2 capacity. All SDO services hosted in DUB must complete mandatory architecture upgrades that unblock and reduce effort of region migrations. Teams should also complete recommended architectural upgrades to improve its services region flexibility.

For Buyer Risk Prevention \\\\(BRP\\\\), in 2025 this involves migrating critical systems across Payment Risk, Account Integrity, and Abuse Prevention from DUB to new regions: Zaragoza \\\\(ZAZ\\\\) and Frankfurt \\\\(FRA\\\\) with the goal to fully exit DUB by 2026. The goal is to improve resilience, meet evolving regulatory requirements, and enhance customer experience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Program Goals and Timelines ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Goal 1: Be prod ready for sub-experience \\\\(BRP is part of cart/checkout and identity\\\\) traffic migration\\\\*\\\\* by 7/31 \\\\(UK/SP marketplaces to ZAZ\\\\) and 8/15 \\\\(DE marketplace to FRA\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Goal 2: Achieve a 40% IMR costs Reduction in DUB\\\\*\\\\* by 10/16/2025. The bigger needle movers are the Bring Your Own Account fleets which have CORE owned service holding BRP data, we own those fleets for accounting purposes. We will also ensure that we leaving a manageable effort scope to fully exit DUB on 2026.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Migration Approach and Challenges ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRegion Flexibility team decided to perform the traffic switch in phases to reduce the complexity and risk by selecting sub-experiences \\\\(customer experience on Amazon web page that can be migrated mostly independently\\\\) and specific market places on 2025. BRP is only affected by cart/checkout and identity sub-experiences and we need to be ready for traffic switch by 7/31 \\\\(ZAZ\\\\) and 8/15 \\\\(FRA\\\\) for cart/checkout and 8/15 \\\\(ZAZ\\\\) and 8/31 \\\\(FRA\\\\) for identity. All the other marketplaces will remain in DUB until 2026, therefore this means the involved services will need to support traffic in DUB, ZAZ, and FRA during that period.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMany of our services are highly dependent on CORE team to run our fraud evaluations, we are working very closely with them to ensure their systems are ready by 6/15 \\\\(or earlier\\\\) to allow at least 6 weeks of service testing. We have agreed with CORE to replicate all the data in each region when necessary to avoid any fraud detection capabilities regression and only performing cross-region calls otherwise. If the BRP service is not latency sensitive, you can call CORE service or any other dependency not yet available on ZAZ/FRA with a cross region call which will add around 30ms with peaks of 65ms.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are working on a ML testing strategy to ensure that all the intents are well tested and have parity with current DUB performance before any traffic switch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Tech Strategy ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are working on a tech strategy document which will include BRP specific SOP to guide BRP service migration. We are currently reviewing the document with leadership and we will share it here when done. ETA 3/15.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Mitigation Strategies ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Risk 1: Resource and Sequencing Challenges\\\\*\\\\* BRP's Region Flexibility efforts can encounter risk due to overlapping priorities, competing initiatives, and peak workloads.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Risk 2: Data, Latency, and Model Performance Risks\\\\*\\\\* Decentralizing data and ML models across regions poses risks to fraud detection accuracy, latency, and data availability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Risk 3: External to BRP Dependency Risks\\\\*\\\\* BRP's success depends on robust mechanisms to monitor dependencies, escalate risks, and maintain alignment with teams like CARML and URES.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Key Points of Contact ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:942px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\\\\\n|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 163px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)Role Area|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 157px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)Overall BRP|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 130px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)Payment Risk|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 178px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)Account Integrity|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 127px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)Buyer Abuse|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 127px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)ML|=\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width: 119px;\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)CORE\\\\\\\\n|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:163px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*STL\\\\*\\\\*|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:157px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)psperez@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:130px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)psperez@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:178px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)shisrame@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)psperez@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)planfeng@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:119px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)prdeepn@\\\\\\\\n|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:163px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*Tech\\\\*\\\\*|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:157px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)gabeprz@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:130px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)ritikaj@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:178px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)bradcamp@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)torbettp@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)chienluc@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:119px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)prdeepn@\\\\\\\\n|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:163px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*Senior Leadership\\\\*\\\\*|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:157px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)ujjwalm@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:130px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)rajks@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:178px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)ajat@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)mrbohl@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:127px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)xiaohus@|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"width:119px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)gddesai@\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Office Hours ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have weekly BRP Region Flexibility office hours with our Sr SDEs and ML PoCs.

The Region Flexibility Engineering \\\\(RFE\\\\) organization is providing tooling and general guidance to teams to assist in the migration out of these regions and into new ones, as well as driving and coordinating campaigns to make services more region flexible. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis wiki is intended to supplement existing Region Flexibility guidance and documentation by providing SPS builders more specific resources and opinionated guidance both for short-term mitigations and for long-term flexibility.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Exiting DUB ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe capacity constraints in DUB are the most pressing. Datacenter electricity usage in Ireland \\\\[\\\\[exceeded 14% of all usage in 2022>>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61308747\\\\]\\\\] and the local utility has \\\\[\\\\[imposed a moratorium on datacenter expansion through 2028>>https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/06/17/up-to-82-data-centres-operating-in-republic\\\\]\\\\]. To ensure that SDO continues to have capacity to grow and to not impact other AWS customers in the region, SDO is now committed to fully exit DUB by the end of 2026. \\\\[\\\\[In 2025, SPS will take a 40% DUB capacity reduction goal>>SPS-RegionFlex.Yearly.2025\\\\]\\\\].\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo meet this 2025 goal, SPS will establish new regional instances of 1\\\\) services that are dependencies of retail sub-experiences \\\\(Checkout\\\\), 2\\\\) services that constitute 80% of SPS DUB IMR, and 3\\\\)  partner-facing Mons and SP-API applications. Each of these services will migrate relevant data and traffic to ZAZ, FRA, or both according to their \\\\[\\\\[routing strategy>>SPS-RegionFlex.RoutingStrategies\\\\]\\\\]. In 2026, SPS will complete our migration out of DUB by establishing remaining services in ZAZ and FRA, migrating remaining data out of DUB, and establishing at least a subset of services to HYD.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Other Initiatives ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn addition to exiting DUB, SDO will need to eventually exit IAD and PDX regions. IAD will primarily require SDO services to migrate from existing AZs to new, “Holiday” AZs that are more distant than existing AZs and have higher latency. The first “Holiday” AZs will become available in 2025 and specific fleets have been contacted to migrate. SPS teams should expect to begin migrating in 2026. Migrating to the new AZs will be significantly less effort than migrating to a new region, however there is still manual work required.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe RFE team is currently considering what regions will be made available to replace PDX. Selling Partner customers would benefit from new regions being located in southeast Asia, where the majority of Selling Partners are based. We will continue to advocate that the RFE team choose regions that offer benefit to our customers while also solving capacity constraints. We currently do not have even soft commitments on new region launches after 2025 and only know ZAZ, FRA, and IAD \\\\(Holiday\\\\) will be available long-term. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe below table is constructed using both the RFE team's roadmap for SDO foundational services \\\\(communicated in MBR\\\\) and the \\\\[\\\\[DARU program's timeline>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CloudTune/CapacityManagementPlanning/Programs/SDODiversifyAWSRegionUsage/\\\\]\\\\] for capacity reduction.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\[\\\\[image:region-guidance-table.png||width=\\\\\\\\\\\"100%\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Mental Model ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRegions mitigate a fundamental problem in computation, which is that distance generates latency. By collocating our services in regions, we can rely on a low-latency, consistent, and reliable network. Communication between regions occurs over large distances and across multiple network providers, meaning orders of magnitude higher latency, low consistency of that latency, much lower reliability, and significantly higher costs. Software that can rely on intra-region communication is simpler to develop, easier to maintain, cheaper to run, and provides a better customer experience. Services are best deployed to multiple regions and interact with other services only within the same region.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAWS currently offers 31 geographically dispersed and fault-isolated AWS regions across two AWS partitions \\\\(‘aws’ and ‘aws-cn’\\\\). However, only four of these regions have SDO-foundational software, such as CloudAuth, Allegiance, or OPF. SPS services are generally deployed into at least one of the three ‘aws’ partition  regions: IAD \\\\(NA / us-east-1\\\\), DUB \\\\(EU / eu-west-1\\\\), and PDX \\\\(FE / us-west-2\\\\). RFE identifies these three regions as mega-regions. These mega-regions are fast approaching their physical capacity limits, and simply reducing each service’s footprint is not enough to ensure we have continued capacity for growth. To permanently reduce capacity in existing regions, services must be either turned off or migrated elsewhere. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo that end, the RFE team is driving the establishment of SDO-foundational software in additional regions. \\\\*\\\\*No single new region will exceed or even match the capacity in existing mega-regions\\\\*\\\\*, so instead of doing a lift and shift migration, SDO must adopt multiple new AWS regions for each existing mega-region. If we assume that DUB, IAD and PDX will each require at least two replacement regions, then SDO will likely need to adopt at least one new AWS regions each of the next 6 years. This means we need a consistent, repeatable strategy along with automation that is integrated into our existing tooling and frameworks.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nServices at Amazon utilize a \\\\[\\\\[routing strategy>>SPS-RegionFlex.RoutingStrategies\\\\]\\\\] to determine where a request can be processed efficiently and where data is stored. Service owners may not even know which strategy they use - most services are routed implicitly by relying on utilizing services in the same region for any given request. However, the routing strategy informs a service which regions it must utilize and when, where data must be available, and how to coordinate with consumers and dependencies. It is important that services utilize a relatively small set of routing strategies to increase in-region service alignment and reduce complexity when communicating with other services. Service owners must start by identifying and formalizing their service's choice of routing strategy in order to plan migrations. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== How can I stay connected or get help? ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Watch out for emailed flashes and updates from \\\\[\\\\[wwsps-regionflexibility-core@amazon.com>>https://email-list.corp.amazon.com/email-list/expand-list/wwsps-regionflexibility-core\\\\]\\\\] \\\\(pre-subscribed\\\\)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Join the SDO-wide Region Flex Slack channel \\\\(\\\\[\\\\[#region-flex-2024>>https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C05D7C8PVDY\\\\]\\\\]\\\\)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Join the SPS-specific Region Flex Slack channel \\\\(\\\\[\\\\[#sps-region-flex>>https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C06NN8Q8V9R\\\\]\\\\]\\\\)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Contact your nearest \\\\[\\\\[SPS Region Flex SPOC>>SPS-RegionFlex.Contact.WebHome||anchor=\\\\\\\\\\\"HSPSRegionFlexSPOCs\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Contact \\\\(or join\\\\) the \\\\[\\\\[SPS Region Flex Working Group>>SPS-RegionFlex.Contact.WebHome||anchor=\\\\\\\\\\\"HSPSRegionFlexWorkingGroup\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\"}\\n[1]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/SPS-RegionFlex/\\\\\\\"\\n[2]: \\\\\\\"https://permissions.amazon.com/group.mhtml?group=wwsps-regionflexibility-wg&group_type=ldap\\\\\\\"\\n[3]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/XWiki/briahenk\\\\\\\"\\n[4]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/SPS-RegionFlex/?viewer=code&showlinenumbers=1\\\\\\\"\"},{\"url\":\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Region_Flexibility/Campaigns/search_all_robot_traffic_es_uk_zaz/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Search Region Flex Exit-DUB Policy Engine Campaign\",\"domain\":\"wiki\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1736382135000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":6,\"categoryList\":[\"Quip2Wiki\",\"Quip2Wiki:xhtml\"],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n                    \\\\\\\\n      # Wiki source code of [Search Region Flex Exit-DUB Policy Engine Campaign][1]\\n\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\n              **Primary Owner **[ region-flexibility-engineering-all \\\\(LDAP\\\\) ][2]\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\n                                                                      \\\\\\\\n        Last modified 7 months ago by [jiayaj][3].\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n---\\n\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  [Show line numbers][4]\\\\\\\\n  <!-- \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    DO NOT change the content of this Wiki\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    The content of this Wiki page was generated by Quip2Wiki tool from a Quip document, so any change using Wiki editor can be lost when new updates from Quip2Wiki are submitted.\\\\\\\\n    Please consider changing the original Quip document at https://quip-amazon.com/IpcbAJ91T4lg\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n -->\\\\\\\\n<html>\\\\\\\\n<body>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<div class='hidden-print'>\\\\\\\\n<p><i style='color:#888888; font-size:small;'>This page was created by <a href=\\\\\\\\\\\"/bin/view/Quip2Wiki\\\\\\\\\\\">Quip2Wiki</a> from a Quip document \\\\(<a href=\\\\\\\\\\\"https://quip-amazon.com/IpcbAJ91T4lg\\\\\\\\\\\">See original</a>\\\\) at 'Thu, 09 Jan 2025 00:22:14 GMT'</i></p>\\\\\\\\n<hr/>\\\\\\\\n</div>\\\\\\\\n<h2><b>Intro</b></h2>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>SDO must fully exit the DUB region by end of 2026, and in support of this requirement Amazon Search is migrating its workload serving retail search pages for the UK, ES and IN marketplaces from DUB to ZAZ region, and the DE marketplace from DUB to FRA region in 2025. </p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>Your service has been identified as a critical dependency of Search systems covered by these migrations.

SDO’s growth in these regions has reached a point where we can no longer assume unconstrained growth in future years. Capacity constraints began to impact SDO’s ability to increase capacity demand in 2023, with anticipated shortfalls through 2030. </p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>SDO is committed to fully exiting from DUB by the end of 2026, and targets to achieve a 40% server count reduction in DUB by October 1, 2025. In 2025, SDO will migrate customer-facing experiences and marketplaces from DUB to the target AWS regions including ZAZ \\\\(eu-south-2/Zaragoza\\\\) and FRA \\\\(eu-central-1/Frankfurt\\\\). Aligned with SDO's strategy to exit DUB, Search will fully migrate UK/ES/IN marketplaces from DUB to ZAZ and DE marketplace to FRA.</p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>To scale this migration effort, RFE is leveraging Policy Engine \\\\(PE\\\\) campaigns to proactively notify teams that their pipelines have been identified as dependencies for specific sub-experience migration plans. This allows RFE to align teams on the need to migrate and the associated timeline, before the migration work begins in earnest.</p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>Key dates for Search experience migration are highlighted below:</p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<div data-section-style='13'><table title='Sheet1' style='width: 53.2684em' border='1px' borderColor='#c7cbd1'><thead><tr style='background-color:#E1E1E1;'><th style='text-align: left;'><b><span>Milestone</span></b>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n</th><th style='text-align: center;'><b><span>ZAZ Date</span></b>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n</th><th style='text-align: center;'><b><span>FRA Date</span></b>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span>Infrastructure pre-requisite and dependency setup</span>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n</td><td style='text-align: center;'><span>3/28/2025</span>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n</td><td style='text-align: center;'><span>5/30/2025</span>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n</td></tr><tr><td><i><span><b>Search Robot Traffic sub-experience migration \\\\(ES+UK+IN / DE\\\\)</b></span></i>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span>Robotic traffic dialing up</span>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n</td><td style='text-align: center;'><span>4/15/2025</span>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n</td><td style='text-align: center;'><span>6/16/2025</span>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n</td></tr><tr><td><i><span><b>Search All Traffic sub-experience migration \\\\(ES+UK+IN / DE\\\\)</b></span></i>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span>All traffic dialing up</span>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n</td><td style='text-align: center;'><span>5/15/2025</span>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n</td><td style='text-align: center;'><span>8/1/2025</span>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n</td></tr><tr><td><span>UK/ES/IN and DE serving DUB capacity return</span>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n</td><td style='text-align: center;'><span>9/30/2025</span>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n</td><td style='text-align: center;'><span>9/30/2025</span>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n</td></tr><tr><td><i><span><b>Search Offline systems sub-experience migration</b></span></i>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span>Offline systems migration completed</span>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n</td><td style='text-align: center;'><span>8/29/2025</span>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n</td><td style='text-align: center;'><span>N/A</span>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>For more information about how experience migrations are being planned, please refer to <a href=\\\\\\\\\\\"/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Coordinating\\\\_Migrations/\\\\\\\\\\\">Region Flexibility Coordinating Migrations</a>. </p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>For more information about Search’s 2025 migration plan, please refer to <a href=\\\\\\\\\\\"https://amazon.awsapps.com/workdocs-amazon/index.html#/document/83f7e0a10629a7ee9bbdda45c7c51b3be231b2b35917992328e6ff7866c092f9\\\\\\\\\\\">2025 Search Exit DUB Migration Strategy</a>.</p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<h2><b><b>How we detected this</b></b></h2>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>The Search team, in collaboration with Region Flexibly Engineering \\\\(RFE\\\\) and its analytics team, has complied a list of high-confidence pipelines, that are dependencies for the Search sub-experiences migration.

It attempts to address common questions and presents high level migration strategy for migrating the services out of DUB. Objective of the document is to a\\\\) socialize the DARU goal and RFE guidance for 2025, b\\\\) review and guide the IESP Teams to meet their DUB reduction targets at L7 orgs. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== What is DARU 2025 goal? Why is this goal important? ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn 2025, DARU has set 2025 goal to reduce Q4'25 forecasted SDO footprint by 40% through service migrations and deprecations out of DUB region. This corresponds to IESP responsibility of 544 server migrations out of DUB region in 2025.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNot addressing the capacity constraints will result in business and customer impact for SDO such as pausing marketplace expansions, eliminating peak deal events, and hinder ability to execute emergent scaling due to unanticipated customer behaviour. Improving architecture flexibility and migrating to non-concentrated AWS regions results in benefits such as: \\\\(1\\\\) Reduced IMR - IMR for foundational services in destination regions is ~~30-35% cheaper compared to DUB; \\\\(2\\\\) Improving latency for end-users by moving workloads closer to where customers are located; \\\\(3\\\\) Minimized impact of capacity constraints; \\\\(4\\\\) Faster response to data compliance regulation.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== What is the execution strategy to meet 2025 goal for IESP? ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, we plan to start by moving the systems that can move relatively independently - things like ML training, async services, internal tooling, non-EC2 instances or small clusters of services connected to each other but minimally connected back to the “big ball of services”. Wherever we can, we'll find groups of systems that can be moved to a new region independently. Teams can help by identifying parts that have low latency requirements \\\\(high timeouts or async\\\\). Cross-region traffic in the steady-state will be monitored, managed, and optimized to ensure the impact to our customers are well understood. Wherever possible, we prefer services that have large footprints that meet this criteria.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe recommend migrating to ZAZ unless there are specific reasons \\\\(like Compliance, cross-region latency impact etc.\\\\) not to do so. BOM or HYD migrations would require PE review \\\\(\\\\[\\\\[Jenny Shah>>https://phonetool.amazon.com/users/jennysha\\\\]\\\\]\\\\). Since Checkout migration as a sub-experience is planned in 2026 for IN traffic, the teams are requested to defer the migration of all the Retail Checkout-related latency sensitive services to 2026. Non-Retail Checkout service migrations can continue as per plan. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n== Details of migration tools ==\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% cellspacing=\\\\\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\\\\\" class=\\\\\\\\\\\"MsoTable15Grid1LightAccent1\\\\\\\\\\\" style=\\\\\\\\\\\"border-collapse:collapse; border:none\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\\\\\n|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"background-color:black; background:black; border-style:solid; border-width:1.0pt; width:117.0pt\\\\\\\\\\\" width=\\\\\\\\\\\"156\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\(\\\\(\\\\(\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"margin-bottom:0in; padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"background-color:black; color:#ffffff; font-size:8pt; line-height:normal\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*Tool Name\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\n\\\\)\\\\)\\\\)|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"background-color:black; background:black; border-left:none; border-style:solid; border-width:1.0pt; width:117.0pt\\\\\\\\\\\" width=\\\\\\\\\\\"156\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\(\\\\(\\\\(\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"margin-bottom:0in; padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"background-color:black; color:white; font-size:8pt; line-height:normal\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*Tool Description\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\n\\\\)\\\\)\\\\)|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"background-color:black; background:black; border-left:none; border-style:solid; border-width:1.0pt; width:117.0pt\\\\\\\\\\\" width=\\\\\\\\\\\"156\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\(\\\\(\\\\(\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"margin-bottom:0in; padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"background-color:black; color:white; font-size:8pt; line-height:normal\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*Tool link\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\n\\\\)\\\\)\\\\)|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"background-color:black; background:black; border-left:none; border-style:solid; border-width:1.0pt; width:117.0pt\\\\\\\\\\\" width=\\\\\\\\\\\"156\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\(\\\\(\\\\(\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"margin-bottom:0in; padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"background-color:black; color:white; font-size:8pt; line-height:normal\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*Comment\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\n\\\\)\\\\)\\\\)\\\\\\\\n|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"border-style:solid; border-top:none; border-width:1.0pt; width:117.0pt\\\\\\\\\\\" width=\\\\\\\\\\\"1\"},{\"url\":\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/IN-Region-Flexibility/\",\"displayTitle\":\"IN Region Flexibility\",\"domain\":\"wiki\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1740419757000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":8,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n                    \\\\\\\\n      # Wiki source code of [IN Region Flexibility][1]\\n\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\n              **Primary Owner **[ in-region-flexibility \\\\(LDAP\\\\) ][2]\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\n                                                                      \\\\\\\\n        Last modified 5 months ago by [paparaoc][3].\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n---\\n\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  [Show line numbers][4]\\\\\\\\n  {{transclude name=\\\\\\\\\\\"INRegionFlexibility\\\\\\\\\\\"/}}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n{{comment}}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  The template for the IN Regional Flexibility wiki can be found at https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Templates/INRegionFlexibility/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n{{/comment}}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n{{container cssClass=\\\\\\\\\\\"floatinginfobox\\\\\\\\\\\"}}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% border=\\\\\\\\\\\"1\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n|\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"border-right:2.5px solid #00004d; border-left:2.5px solid #00004d; padding-right:25px; padding-left:25px; width:30%\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\(\\\\(\\\\(\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n{{toc/}}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Problem Scope ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOver the next 18-24 months the Stores, Devices, and Other \\\\(SDO\\\\) organization will move 25%+ of our OLTP data across AWS regions to provide operational flexibility and overcome scaling constraints for our existing and new marketplace expansion. Region flexibility is an SDO led initiative aimed at simplifying the efforts to get SDO services rapidly into new or existing AWS regions to address operational and regulatory challenges. Since 2020, SDO has been investing in components of regional flexibility by enabling technologies: Service Configuration Discovery and Routing \\\\(Axon, Almanac, Veritas, Planisphere, others\\\\), Data analysis \\\\(Metador, Andes, others\\\\) and movement \\\\(Hotwire/LMT, GlobeMaster, CDMS\\\\). While these investments allowed us to address specific pain points, Service/Application owners \\\\(Builders\\\\) are required to assemble these services to build out and execute a migration recipe that meets their need and addresses constraints. What is missing is a guided, friction-less customer experience or unified solution for Builders to orchestrate \\\\(fully/semi-automated or manual\\\\) migrations that addresses dependencies, run time latency needs, and shared data access constraints, while still keeping their business running.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAs an example, the Region Flexibility team may want to stand up \\\\(all\\\\) the necessary services for an experience in a new region, then migrate the data necessary for the experience incrementally and atomically \\\\(e.g. such that all the data for a specific customer appears in the new region together\\\\). This requires understanding the services' upstream and downstream dependencies, along with the computational views that the services consume. It also requires orchestrating data movement to aid functional debugging, validation, and auditing. Doing these migrations without coordination will be resource intensive for application owners and builders.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Our Vision ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nEnable SDO's businesses to operate outside of our existing \\\\\\\\\\\"mega-regions\\\\\\\\\\\" of IAD, DUB, and PDX; and enable the movement of traffic across AWS regions for the purposes of cost-efficiency, availability, change in legal compliance requirements etc. without effort from the service owner. The North Star for region flexibility is to centrally deploy services to new or expanding regions and move data and customer traffic between regions in a matter of months without negatively impacting service owners or customers. In short, most service owners should not need to know where their systems and data reside.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe IN Region Flexibility team's charter focuses on three core objectives: 1\\\\) Execute DARU S-Team Goal compliance and facilitate DUB exit for IES by EOY 2026; 2\\\\) Drive IES services to be 100% region flexible with optimal investments and overall org productivity enhancements; and 3\\\\) Develop robust region and data migration tooling via strategic collaboration with WW Region Flex Engineering \\\\(RFE\\\\) and Managed Migration Experience \\\\(M2X\\\\) organizations. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe IN Region Flexibility team owns UI console and Testing Framework in this initiative and is responsible for establishing new solutions and architectural patterns in these fields to help services owners get into regions more quickly, in partnership with different teams at Amazon.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Program Overview ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nhttps://w.amazon.com/bin/view/IN-Region-Flexibility/Overview/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Tenets ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\[TBD\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n== Architecture ==\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\[\\\\[image:https://maxis-file-service-prod-dub.dub.proxy.amazon.com/issues/cabe9f31-df17-4958-8ff5-d2aaa7c6e548/attachments/e693b07c32ba24ff14c5674857d1681c8cf20e973beca1924f7bc6db881c4c26\\\\_1b2ac41c-af1a-46f2-9b72-1b0990552717||width=\\\\\\\\\\\"50%\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Coordinator\\\\*\\\\* is an umbrella service which contains various different services/component. It is an orchestration service that delegates the entire migration process to various tools and components. These various tools and components will also depend on what type of migration a customer wants to perform.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*MetaDor\\\\*\\\\* is the the component that will power the discovery experience over the MetaData UI console. MetaDor will be the source of information for getting information required to enable migrations on service/dataset level. These informations will be used to prepare migration entity, MODs and MEDs.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*DRA\\\\*\\\\* is the component which will keep track of status of entities under migration and enable in routing traffic to proper region.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Data Movement Services\\\\*\\\\* is the component which will actually move the data, i.e, perform migration. It will also provide capabilities to Coordinator to start/stop/terminate migration at Dataset/service level. One of the example if this service is CDMS which is is a suite of data movement solutions for SDO data owners who need to move their data across AWS regions, partitions, accounts and storage technologies.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe detailed architecture for the entire Region Flexibility program can be found here

changes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCurrent State\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBelow is world map showing the distribution of current HBA stack software and countries/businesses supported:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe HBA full stack is made up of over 45 services, including candidate-facing websites, recruiter and other operational/admin portals, as well as backend systems like data sources and orchestrators. The HBA-Core is a minimalistic version of the full HBA stack, running a subset of just under 7 services:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCareerSite website \\\\(country-specific, can be in marketplace or isolated hiring mode\\\\)\\\\\\\\nJobContainer sourcing Salesforce jobs\\\\\\\\nCDS hosting candidate data\\\\\\\\nPACE website and checklist service augmenting the Salesforce hiring experience\\\\\\\\nCandidate Dashboard website\\\\\\\\nAuthPortal as a web portal and a backend Cognito-based service\\\\\\\\nGlobal contact us page and BFF\\\\\\\\nTo transition the HBA-Core stack to the full HBA stack, additional services \\\\(±30, excluding global services like RAMP and ROMP\\\\) would need to be added, such as:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAES and HFS orchestrators\\\\\\\\nCandidate-facing systems like PHO, Badge Photo, AVA\\\\\\\\nBackend services like ADS, HDE, JMS, JVS, CCS, Knowledge Base Store, Contact Channels, and Amazon Connect instance\\\\\\\\nRecruiter-facing systems like Template Management, URI and Hubble reporting, LOMP, Control Center, JMP, Appointment Portal, CAMP, Admin Portal, Agent Desktop, and Bulk Ops\\\\\\\\nThe current HBA-Core infrastructure for India is deployed in the ap-south-2 AWS region.\\\\\\\\nProposal\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOption 1: Expand existing FRA \\\\(eu-central-1\\\\) HBA-Core into a full stack and migrate data from HYD/BOM\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith this option, we would use the India CS expansion as an opportunity to make the CS stack compliant with the DARU region flexibility goals. This would involve extending the existing HBA-Core services deployed in the eu-central-1 \\\\(FRA\\\\) region into a full HBA stack.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis requires deploying the remaining ~30 services that are currently missing from the HBA-Core stack, such as the AES and HFS orchestrators, candidate-facing systems, backend services, and recruiter-facing portals. Additionally, we would need to migrate the existing data that is currently stored in the CDS and AuthPortal components of the India HBA-Core stack deployed in ap-south-1 \\\\(BOM\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOverall, this option prioritizes compliance with the DARU goals, even if it means taking on more dev effort \\\\(±50 weeks of stack setup + 20 weeks for data migration\\\\) compared to other options. However, this does not mean HBA will be overal compliant with DARU guidance as it’s currently hosting 2 other stacks in eu-west-1 \\\\(1 full HBA running UK and India WFS hiring; 1 HBA-Core running UK and Ireland CS hiring\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that it’s easier to do a 1-time migration for all customers in DUB vs. doing it gradually per customer, with blast radius mitigated by the migration strategy adopted. More on this HVH Exit DUB Initiative \\\\(RFE/DARU\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPros:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAligns with the DARU region flexibility goals by not expanding the current volume of usage of DUB stack.\\\\\\\\nIncreases the operational overhead, as we would now have a full HBA stack running in the eu-central-1 region, in addition to the other HBA stacks running in different regions.\\\\\\\\nCons:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRequires additional development effort to deploy the new services and migrate the existing data.\\\\\\\\nRough estimate: 250 pipelines, 1 days of effort for each, ±50 additional weeks.\\\\\\\\nMigrating the Cognito-based AuthPortal may require users to reset their passwords, which needs to be aligned on with the business, or mitigated with extra dev effort on AuthPortal side to do Just-In-Time Migration of users. https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/approaches-for-migrating-users-to-amazon-cognito-user-pools/\\\\\\\\nDeploying India CS and India FC on different physical stacks creates data isolation, preventing a unified recruiter experience. This implementation would force recruiters to switch physical regions when managing different India lines of business, requiring context switching between two EU regions. Virtual regions concept cannot currently span countries or lines of business across different physical stacks, fragmenting the overall experience.\\\\\\\\nRequires additional effort to rebuild the SF-to-CDS sync on the FRA stack, currently established between SF and BOM region.\\\\\\\\nOption 2 \\\\[Preferred\\\\]: Migrate existing HYD/BOM HBA-Core to existing HBA full stack in DUB \\\\(eu-west-1\\\\)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith this option, we would reuse an existing DUB stack which is already proven to run multiple countries and modes of hiring \\\\(Isolated Agency Hiring and Marketplace Hiring\\\\). We would treat CS as another Isolated Hiring \\\\(ISO\\\\) running in parallel with Workforce Staffing \\\\(WFS\\\\) in the marketplace mode.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis option requires migrating the data from the CDS and AuthPortal components of the existing HBA-Core stack in BOM \\\\(ap-south-1\\\\) to the DUB \\\\(eu-west-1\\\\) stack. This means the business would need to weigh in on the impact to customers who may need to reset their passwords, as Cognito logins would need to be migrated, or accept additional dev effort and tech complexity to mitigate \\\\(more details below\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor the CareerSite, we could either keep the current websites in HYD or reconfigure the domain names to point to the CS in DUB. This decision is not a game-changer and can be finalized in the CS design doc. However, the CS BFF \\\\(Backend for Frontend\\\\) would need to point to the DUB stack.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPros:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLowest development effort, as it only involves the data migration, no new stack setup. Total effort estimated at 20 weeks.\\\\\\\\nAllows deprecation of existing HBA-Core India stack resulting in reduced operational burden for teams.\\\\\\\\nCons:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExpands the usage footprint of servers in DUB, which conflicts with the DARU initiative to exit the region by 2026. However, adding India CS to the existing DUB stack involves minimal migration effort, as the data resides in the same databases and uses existing compute infrastructure. The 2023-2025 hiring volumes \\\\(21,332 in 2023, 19,100 in 2024, ~7,000 in 2025\\\\) represent a manageable growth that marginally impacts server infrastructure or migration complexity.\\\\\\\\nIf we migrate and backfill candidate logins in Cognito, customers may have to reset their passwords. This needs discussion with the business. Can be mitigated with extra dev effort on AuthPortal side to do Just-In-Time Migration of users. https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/approaches-for-migrating-users-to-amazon-cognito-user-pools/. Same con with Option 1 above.\\\\\\\\nAn alternative approach to this problem is to keep the current Cognito stack for India CS candidates in the BOM \\\\(ap-south-2\\\\) stack, and make the AuthPortal service in DUB call the BOM Cognito, avoiding the need for data backfill and any impact on customer login experience. However this will introdcue more complexity in the application layer, and CDS and Auth will no longer maintain a 1:1 stack mapping. This solution while possible, is not recommended.\\\\\\\\nMigrating candidates from CDS BOM to DUB req\"},{\"url\":\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Users/yngluo/Quip/WikiPageDraft-2025GroceryExperienceExitDUBMigrationplan/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Wiki Page Draft - 2025 Grocery Experience Exit DUB Migration plan\",\"domain\":\"wiki\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1731977809000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":10,\"categoryList\":[\"Quip2Wiki\",\"Quip2Wiki:xhtml\"],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n                    \\\\\\\\n      # Wiki source code of [Wiki Page Draft - 2025 Grocery Experience Exit DUB Migration plan][1]\\n\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\n                        **Primary Contact **[yngluo \\\\(user\\\\)][2]_[ How do I change this value?][3]_\\\\\\\\n                  \\\\\\\\n                                                                      \\\\\\\\n        Last modified 8 months ago by [yngluo][4].\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n---\\n\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  [Show line numbers][5]\\\\\\\\n  <!-- \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    DO NOT change the content of this Wiki\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    The content of this Wiki page was generated by Quip2Wiki tool from a Quip document, so any change using Wiki editor can be lost when new updates from Quip2Wiki are submitted.\\\\\\\\n    Please consider changing the original Quip document at https://quip-amazon.com/yT5cA6uXLDV7\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n -->\\\\\\\\n<html>\\\\\\\\n<body>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<div class='hidden-print'>\\\\\\\\n<p><i style='color:#888888; font-size:small;'>This page was created by <a href=\\\\\\\\\\\"/bin/view/Quip2Wiki\\\\\\\\\\\">Quip2Wiki</a> from a Quip document \\\\(<a href=\\\\\\\\\\\"https://quip-amazon.com/yT5cA6uXLDV7\\\\\\\\\\\">See original</a>\\\\) at 'Tue, 19 Nov 2024 00:56:48 GMT'</i></p>\\\\\\\\n<hr/>\\\\\\\\n</div>\\\\\\\\n<h2><b>Summary</b></h2>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>Amazon’s SDO \\\\(Stores, Devices, and Other\\\\) Organization is running programs like <a href=\\\\\\\\\\\"/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility\\\\\\\\\\\">Regional Flexibility</a>, and <a href=\\\\\\\\\\\"/bin/view/CloudTune/CapacityManagementPlanning/Programs/SDODiversifyAWSRegionUsage/\\\\\\\\\\\">Diversify AWS Region Usage \\\\(DARU\\\\)</a> to enable SDO’s business to operate outside of our existing Retail “mega-regions” of IAD, DUB and PDX.

Migration Strategy </h2>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>We can satisfy 2025 requirements entirely through sub-experience migrations \\\\(i.e. migrating pipelines supporting experiences that are not used by external Amazon customers\\\\). While the breakdown is not going to necessarily by 40% across all leaders for 2025, leaders should know that migrations should be completed by the end of 2026. This means that extra effort for one leader’s org in 2025 means less effort in 2026, and vice versa.</p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>Sub-experiences should be assessed by service owners to validate whether or not they are sensitive to additional latency. For example, if a particular service is particularly chatty on the network, it likely should migrate with its up- or down-streams in order to prevent significant degradation in performance and IMR. To help assess this, the <a href=\\\\\\\\\\\"https://axon.ops.amazon.dev/service-graph\\\\\\\\\\\">Axon team has provided a service graph analysis</a>, including upstream and downstream traffic metrics for each service over a requested period. </p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>Ideally, we can choose in-scope services by ranking services by the highest Server Count and the lowest in/out call counts in order to satisfy the 2025 requirement to cut 40% of server utilization as this is a good proxy for effort ROI assuming 10 SDE weeks of effort per pipeline. However, service owners should assess whether or not their actual service will take more or less than the “average” 10 SDE-week effort.</p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<ul><li value='1'><span><b>Migration Process Risks</b></span>\\\\\\\\n<ul><li><span>What mechanisms the sub-experience will use to identify timeline risks and ensure <a href=\\\\\\\\\\\"https://wiki.amazon.com/bin/view/Region\\\\_Flexibility/Tech\\\\_Guidance/Deep\\\\_Dives\\\\_and\\\\_Announcements/Announcements/Exit\\\\_DUB\\\\_Strategy#HWhatarethecurrentidentifiedSDOsub-experiences3F\\\\\\\\\\\">timelines for Experience migrations</a> are met.</span></li>\\\\\\\\n<li><span><a href=\\\\\\\\\\\"https://axon.ops.amazon.dev/service-graph\\\\\\\\\\\">Identify dependency graphs of pipelines/services</a> to find “groups” of services that should be migrated together to reduce latency impacts across service groups.</span></li>\\\\\\\\n<li><span>Throw-away work if services are later marked for deprecation as part of core convergence roadmaps.

And believe me, I know great deals when I see them.\n\n**THE ART OF THE REGION FLEX DEAL**\n\nHere's what Region Flexibility is doing - and folks, this is HUGE - we're taking Amazon's entire infrastructure out of those overcrowded mega-regions (DUB, IAD, PDX) and spreading it across the globe. Why? Because we're SMART BUSINESS PEOPLE!\n\n**THE WINNING NUMBERS** 💰\n- 40% cost reduction when you move to ZAZ instead of staying in DUB - that's MASSIVE savings!\n- 30-35% cheaper IMR rates in the new regions - we're talking BILLIONS in savings\n- Exit DUB by 2026 - because Ireland's power grid literally can't handle us anymore (14% of ALL their electricity!)\n\n**WHY THIS IS THE BEST DEAL EVER:**\n\n1. **CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE WINS BIGLY** 🚀\n   - Services physically closer to customers = FASTER response times\n   - No more midnight order spikes crashing single regions\n   - Better availability when regions have issues\n\n2. **OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN** 💪\n   - Multiple regions = multiple options\n   - Never get stuck with capacity constraints again\n   - Scale anywhere, anytime - TOTAL FREEDOM\n\n3. **COST OPTIMIZATION THAT'S INCREDIBLE** 💵\n   - New regions are 30-42% cheaper than DUB\n   - Spread peak loads across regions = less infrastructure needed\n   - IMR efficiency through the ROOF\n\n4. **RESILIENCE & RELIABILITY - THE BEST** 🛡️\n   - No single point of failure\n   - Automatic failover capabilities\n   - Business continuity GUARANTEED\n\n**THE TRUMP BOTTOM LINE:**\n\nThis isn't just moving servers around - this is about WINNING in the global marketplace. We're talking about saving HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS annually while delivering BETTER service to customers worldwide. \n\nThe mega-regions are DONE, folks. They're at capacity. But with Region Flex, we have UNLIMITED GROWTH potential. We can handle Prime Day spikes, Diwali rushes, Black Friday - EVERYTHING - without breaking a sweat.\n\nAnd here's the BEST part - we're not asking, we're DOING IT. 40% reduction in DUB by 2025, completely out by 2026. This is MANDATORY because we're serious about WINNING.\n\nRegion Flexibility isn't just smart - it's GENIUS. Lower costs, better performance, infinite scalability - it's everything a world-class business needs. And we're making it happen NOW!\n\nThis is how you run a REAL infrastructure strategy - not small thinking, but BIG, BOLD moves that transform everything. Region Flex is making Amazon infrastructure GREAT!\n\n**#RegionFlex #WinningStrategy #MakeInfrastructureGreat**"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":35691,"cache_read_input_tokens":109260,"output_tokens":695}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"5d912d72-4ff7-434b-84f5-5666c7012d42","timestamp":"2025-08-15T22:09:22.795Z"}

The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nLooking at the conversation chronologically:\n\n1. Initial Request: User ran `/model` command setting model to claude-opus-4-1-20250805-v1:0, then asked me to assume the role of trump_marketing_agent.md and sell them on Region Flexibility, with instruction to search internally with builder-mcp for more information.\n\n2. My Response: I searched for \"Region Flexibility AWS\" and found extensive information about Amazon's Region Flexibility initiative. I then created a Trump-style sales pitch about Region Flexibility, highlighting cost savings (40% reduction), customer experience benefits, operational flexibility, and resilience.\n\n3. User Feedback: User ran `/agents` command which created an agent called \"trump-style-sales-expert\". They then instructed me to \"Perform research to review statements made by Donald Trump. Now maintain that style and put it into the .claude/agents/trump-style-sales-expert.md file. Make sure to include hand emojis\"\n\n4. My Actions: \n   - Used Task subagent to research Trump's communication style (couldn't access web, used knowledge base)\n   - Attempted to write comprehensive agent file but got error (file not read first)\n   - Read the existing agent file\n   - Successfully edited the agent file with extensive Trump style guidelines including hand emoji usage\n\n5. Final Request: User asked me to assume the role of trump-style-sales-expert and sell them on Region Flexibility, searching internally with builder-mcp for more information. They also requested a detailed summary of the conversation.\n\nKey technical work involved:\n- Using builder-mcp InternalSearch to find Region Flexibility information\n- Reading and editing the agent configuration file at /Volumes/workplace/GenAIPlayground/AgentCreation/Trump/.claude/agents/trump-style-sales-expert.md\n- Creating comprehensive Trump communication style guidelines with strategic hand emoji placement\n\nSummary:\n1.

Key Technical Concepts:\n   - Region Flexibility (RF) / Diversify AWS Region Usage (DARU) - Amazon's initiative to exit mega-regions (DUB, IAD, PDX)\n   - AWS region migration strategies and capacity management\n   - Cost optimization through regional diversification (30-42% savings)\n   - Trump communication patterns: superlatives, repetition, hand gestures, binary positioning\n   - Agent configuration in Claude system (.claude/agents/ directory)\n   - MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for internal search\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - /Volumes/workplace/GenAIPlayground/AgentCreation/Trump/.claude/agents/trump-style-sales-expert.md\n      - Agent configuration file for Trump-style sales expert\n      - Contains name, description, examples, model settings, and detailed prompt instructions\n      - Edited to include comprehensive Trump style guidelines based on research\n      - Key additions:\n        ```markdown\n        ### Hand Gesture Emojis - Strategic Placement \n        - 👐 **Open hands** - Use when emphasizing honesty or big statements\n        - ☝️ **Pointing up** - Making a critical point or number one claim  \n        - 👌 **OK sign** - Precision, perfection, or when describing quality\n        - 👍 **Thumbs up** - Approval, success stories, positive outcomes\n        - ✋ **Raised hand** - Stop/attention or dismissing competition\n        - 🤝 **Handshake** - Deals, agreements, partnerships\n        - 💪 **Flexed bicep** - Strength, power, dominance\n        - 🙌 **Raised hands** - Victory, celebration, incredible outcomes\n        - 🤚 **Back of hand** - Dismissive gestures toward competition\n        ```\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - Error: \"File has not been read yet. Read it first before writing to it.\"\n      - Fix: Used Read function to read the file before attempting to edit it\n      - Successfully used Edit function after reading the file\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Successfully researched Region Flexibility initiative through internal search\n   - Created authentic Trump-style sales pitch with specific data points\n   - Researched Trump's communication patterns when web access failed, used knowledge base\n   - Updated agent file with comprehensive style guidelines including 9 types of hand emojis\n\n6.

So you don't need to cover all your instances\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"with the savings plan. It's the best practice to allow some running to on demand. Ok, nice. Let me\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"actually move on to reserve instances. So let's talk about reserved instances. Uh What is a reserved\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"instance? Uh a reserved instance is a payment subscription that lowers your costs. Uh This is not a\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"physical instance, but it is a billing discount that it is applied to the use of fund demand\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"instances in your account in an hourly basis. These on-demand attributes, uh these on-demand\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"instances match, match the certain attributes or such as the instance type, the region, um the\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"operating system and the tendency for example, in order to benefit from the billing discount. Uh So\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"it's not an actual aws resource. It requires additional management comparing to savings plans. And\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"also it is fixed the specific um uh set of configurations that I mentioned before. Um It does not\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"reserve actual capacity except only for the case that you have is to reserve instances with the\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"zonal scope. Uh and like like savings plans, the following offering exists. So one or three year\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"commitment and three payment options all upfront, partial upfront or upfront. Uh And let's see\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"actually for which services you can deliver us. Uh the reserved instances. So uh they are available\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"for several services for two. There are two types of reserved instances. It is the standard reserve\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"instance which provide the most significant discount um up to 72% versus on demand. And these are\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"best suited for steady state users. However, no change is possible during the commitment term except\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"for some attributes like the size within the same instance family and only for specific for the\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"Linux platform, uh the other type is convertible rice. Um They actually provide the discount up to\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"54%. Uh And the the ability actually to change some attributes as long as the the conversion\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"actually results to the creation of another reserved instances which has equal or greater value. So\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"for example, your target reserve instance can either cost the same or be more expensive. Um A\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"modification of the convertible array uh can be done uh only within the same region. So they are so\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"they are more flexible than the standard reserve instances. Um And they have the ability to change\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"configuration but not the region during the the term. So as we saw earlier, savings plans offer\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"significant savings um over on demand just like the easy to reserve instances, but savings plans\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"have additional flexibility. So in general, for easy to, we encourage you to consider savings plans\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"uh for other services like R DS, red shift elastica and Opener Aws also offers reservations models.\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"So they are specific configuration commitments and they cannot be modified. Um Only reserved\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"instances are available from the specific services and you need to be certain about what uh what you\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"commit for those ones. Um And similar to the AC two, what happens is that the system checks the\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"running instances or nodes you have its hour and it matches them to your act preservations and\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"applies the discount. Um Let me, I have more information. About that. But I can also pause if there\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"are any questions, nothing in the chat, but maybe someone has a question on the spot. Oh, yes, it's\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"a lot. Ok. All right. Uh, let's explore more how the reserve instances work. So, um, the reserve\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"instance benefit applies automatically to the matching users within an account. We have a scenario\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"here. So let's say you have a running on the instance for T three in your account for which you are\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"currently paying on demand pages. If you purchase a reserve instance that matches the specific\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"attributes of your running instance, and then the billing benefit is immediately applied. So next,\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"um you purchase a reserve instance for c for instance, if you do not have the running uh instances\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"in your account that match these attributes, but when you launch an instance that matches the\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"attributes of the C four reserve instance, then the billing benefit is immediately applied. Um As we\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"saw earlier, you can commit again to either one or three years. Um And you will be required to pay\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"for the, the term of the commitment, the term of the reserved instance, even if you stop using it\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"and even if it doesn't apply to a running instance anymore, so it's also important to make sure that\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"you are uh sure about these commitments. Uh Then um earlier, we mentioned that um about some size\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"flexibility actually for easy to arise, there are some, there is size flexibility. And let's see how\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"it actually works uh for uh regional reserve instances that have a third tendancy and that are have\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"a Linux platform, they are also size flexible. And what does it mean? So for example, if you have a\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"one M five extra large result instance, the billing discount can apply it to two M five large\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"running instances and it can also work the other way around. So it can apply to half of the M 52\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"extra large running instance. Just to give you an idea of how flexibility, size, flexibility work.\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"And what about I have both reserved instances. I have easy two savings plans and I have computer\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"savings plans. So I have everything which one applies first. So here's the order actually in which\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"the easy two reserves and savings will apply start if you have at the same time starting from the\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"bottom of the graph. So first the A W uh uh uh a specific ar I apply. So availability zone uh then\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"the regional non size flexible V I apply, then size flexible ones, then the easy two instance\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"savings plan applies and then the compute saving plan applies. Any remaining users will be charged\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"transcript\\\":\\\"on demand. And N now actually that this is covering the EC2 uh reserve instances.

The program focuses on migrating workloads from three AWS mega-regions: IAD \\\\(Americas\\\\), DUB \\\\(Europe & India\\\\), and PDX \\\\(eastern Asia & Australia\\\\).\\\\\\\\n 5: The scope of this program encompasses all AWS services within SDO fleets, including MAWS VPC EC2, Public EC2, Hailstone, Legacy, EBS, S3, Redshift, RDS, DynamoDB, Elasticsearch Service, Lambda, CloudFront, and others deployed in mega regions.\\\\\\\\n 6: The execution strategy involves: 1\\\\) Capacity Type Upgrades - Cascade Lake to Graviton 3, Graviton 2 to Graviton 3, and Mature Gen to Current Gen. 2\\\\) Service Migrations from DUB to ZAZ. 3\\\\) Software Efficiency improvements from JDK 17 Upgrade and Verified Profiler.\\\\\\\\n 7: The program's primary objective is to reduce server utilization in DUB by up to 37% by the end of 2024 through hardware efficiency improvements and migration to alternative regions.\\\\\\\\n 8: AWS has identified specific alternative regions for migration, with ZAZ \\\\(Spain\\\\) and FRA being designated as optimal migration destinations from DUB.\\\\\\\\n 9: These alternative regions offer advantages such as suitable supply runway, secure power outlook, and enhanced customer support capabilities.\\\\\\\\n10: The program is being driven by CloudTune in partnership with Region Flexibility Engineering \\\\(RFE\\\\), with RFE focusing on building foundational solutions, facilitating regional migrations, and making SDO's architecture more flexible for customers and developers.\\\\\\\\n11: The initiative is also an S-Team goal that aims to enable the movement of traffic across AWS regions for purposes of cost-efficiency, availability, and compliance with changing legal requirements.\\\\\\\\n12: For teams participating in the DARU program, there are rate discounts of 30-35% available in new regions like ZAZ compared to existing mega-regions.\\\\\\\\n13: The migration timeline extends to 2029, with the first priority being migration off DUB by Q2'2026.\\\\\\\\n14: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\*SDO Migration Asks from AWS POR \\\\(as of 2/7/24\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\n15: \\\\[\\\\[image:1740376273170-849.png||height=\\\\\\\\\\\"328\\\\\\\\\\\" width=\\\\\\\\\\\"1618\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\n16: \\\\\\\\n17: === \\\\*\\\\*2024 S-Team Goal \\\\(\\\\[\\\\[\\\\(% class=\\\\\\\\\\\"wikiinternallink wikiinternallink\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\*\\\\*733388\\\\*\\\\*>>url:https://kingpin.amazon.com/#/items/733388\\\\]\\\\]\\\\(%%\\\\)\\\\)\\\\*\\\\* ===\\\\\\\\n18: \\\\\\\\n19: \\\\*\\\\*Goal: \\\\*\\\\*Achieve a supportable SDO's Q4’24 peak footprint of 131K servers in Dublin \\\\(eu-west-1/Ireland\\\\)\\\\\\\\n20: \\\\*\\\\*Addition Details? \\\\*\\\\*SDO hosts its technology services via AWS in a handful AWS “mega” regions: Ireland \\\\(eu-west-1/DUB\\\\), Virginia \\\\(us-east-1/IAD\\\\), and Oregon \\\\(us-west-2/PDX\\\\). Today, we are faced with a long-term availability risk to the data center capacity SDO leverages for these services due to concentration in these regions. Concentration in mega regions began to impact SDO’s ability to increase capacity-demand in 2023 and is projected to continue through 2030. Amazon's business will be constrained if SDO does not reduce and eventually exit mega regions by migrating services out between 2024 and 2029. This challenge is motivated by constraints that have been previously shared with leadership. The execution strategy involves: 1\\\\) Capacity Type Upgrades - Cascade Lake to Graviton 3, Graviton 2 to Graviton 3, and Mature Gen to Current Gen. 2\\\\) Service Migrations from DUB to ZAZ. 3\\\\) Software Efficiency improvements from JDK 17 Upgrade and Verified Profiler.\\\\\\\\n21: \\\\*\\\\*Why is this important?\\\\*\\\\* For SDO, the impact of not addressing this challenge results in customer-facing impact that we consider unacceptable: Turning off stores, eliminating peak deal events that excite our customers and grow small-and-medium businesses, hindering emergent scaling due to unanticipated customer behavior, and impeding our ability to meet regulatory Personal Data Protection \\\\(PDP\\\\) policies. Lastly, SDO needs to exit out of DUB by EOY 2026.\\\\\\\\n22: \\\\*\\\\*Success Criteria: \\\\*\\\\*Measurement is based on Q4'24 forecast trajectory. If it's less than or equal to 131K servers, it's GREEN. YELLOW status occurs if the difference between the Q4'24 forecast trajectory and 'committed' reductions is also less than or equal to 131K servers. Exceeding 131K servers makes the goal RED. By EOY 2024, DARU/RF will secure commitments to move 100K servers out of DUB in 2025.\\\\\\\\n23:  \\\\\\\\n24: \\\\\\\\n25: == DARU Program in Fintech ==\\\\\\\\n26: \\\\\\\\n27: For Amazon Payments \\\\(AP\\\\), the DARU program aims to reduce footprint by 31 servers through DUB to ZAZ migration and achieve efficiency of 56 servers through Graviton migration, descaling and deprecation in 2024.\\\\\\\\n28: \\\\[\\\\[https:~~/~~/w.amazon.com/bin/view/Amazon\\\\_Payments/CrossCuttingInitiatives/Infrastructure/DARU>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Amazon\\\\_Payments/CrossCuttingInitiatives/Infrastructure/DARU\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\n29: AP Program Tracker: \\\\[\\\\[https:~~/~~/quip-amazon.com/VwNFAu2aSC0G#temp:C:MYP93049a2de98c4b1ab8ccce1c1>>url:https://quip-amazon.com/VwNFAu2aSC0G#temp:C:MYP93049a2de98c4b1ab8ccce1c1\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\n30: Using a forward-looking multiplier of 1.68, this translates to 62 server migrations to ZAZ and 94 server reductions through efficiencies, targeting a total reduction of 158 servers by January 2025.\\\\\\\\n31: The program is tracked through multiple communication channels:\\\\\\\\n32: \\\\\\\\n33: \\\\* A dedicated Slack channel \\\\(#daru-goal-ap-primary-poc-group-2024\\\\)\\\\\\\\n34: \\\\* Email group: \\\\[\\\\[daru-ap-pocs@amazon.com>>path:mailto:daru-ap-pocs@amazon.com\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\n35: \\\\* Regular office hours sessions\\\\\\\\n36: \\\\\\\\n37: The core group contacts for the program include Ben Mountjoy as Track Sponsor and Swetank Sisodia as Initiative Driver.

Additionally, EDAMS offers an Edge Device Console, a web-based user interface for monitoring and managing all edge compute devices. Another key function of EDAMS is the management of the Certificate Manager Infrastructure, which handles the distribution and rotation of end entity certificates for thin clients \\\\(like HP T640\\\\), tablets \\\\(like Pinnacle+\\\\), and handheld scanners \\\\(like MC33, TC57, PM85, PM560\\\\).

Today, we are faced with a long-term availability risk to the data center capacity SDO leverages for these services due to concentration in these regions. Concentration in mega regions began to impact SDO’s ability to increase capacity-demand in 2023 and is projected to continue through 2030. Amazon's business will be constrained if SDO does not reduce and eventually exit mega regions by migrating services out between 2024 and 2029. This challenge is motivated by constraints that have been previously shared with leadership. The execution strategy involves: 1\\\\) Capacity Type Upgrades - Cascade Lake to Graviton 3, Graviton 2 to Graviton 3, and Mature Gen to Current Gen. 2\\\\) Service Migrations from DUB to ZAZ. 3\\\\) Software Efficiency improvements from JDK 17 Upgrade and Verified Profiler.\\\\\\\\n21: \\\\*\\\\*Why is this important?\\\\*\\\\* For SDO, the impact of not addressing this challenge results in customer-facing impact that we consider unacceptable: Turning off stores, eliminating peak deal events that excite our customers and grow small-and-medium businesses, hindering emergent scaling due to unanticipated customer behavior, and impeding our ability to meet regulatory Personal Data Protection \\\\(PDP\\\\) policies. Lastly, SDO needs to exit out of DUB by EOY 2026.\\\\\\\\n22: \\\\*\\\\*Success Criteria: \\\\*\\\\*Measurement is based on Q4'24 forecast trajectory. If it's less than or equal to 131K servers, it's GREEN. YELLOW status occurs if the difference between the Q4'24 forecast trajectory and 'committed' reductions is also less than or equal to 131K servers. Exceeding 131K servers makes the goal RED.

DARU serves as the overarching umbrella program aimed at addressing SDO’s multi-year capacity assurance risks. The DARU program has key dependencies on the RFE program. RFE focuses on building foundational solutions, facilitating regional migrations, enabling/accelerating migrations to address technological challenges, and making SDO's architecture more flexible for customers and developers. The DARU program is designed to implement a multi-year migration strategy that aligns with AWS's requirements.\\\\\\\\n28: \\\\\\\\n29: \\\\\\\\n30: RFE aims to make it easy to serve existing SDO \\\\(Stores, Devices, and Other\\\\) customer traffic from new AWS regions. The Region Flexibility team is responsible for establishing new solutions and architectural patterns to help services owners get into regions more quickly, in partnership with experts at Amazon working in domains like data and configuration.

EDAMS provides CDK pipelines to orchestrate the deployment of custom software, on edge compute devices. Additionally, EDAMS offers an Edge Device Console, a web-based user interface for monitoring and managing all edge compute devices. Another key function of EDAMS is the management of the Certificate Manager Infrastructure, which handles the distribution and rotation of end entity certificates for thin clients \\\\(like HP T640\\\\), tablets \\\\(like Pinnacle+\\\\), and handheld scanners \\\\(like MC33, TC57, PM85, PM560\\\\). EDAMS currently relies heavily on AWS IoT and Greengrass V1 for edge device management and communication.

The \\\\*\\\\*second group\\\\*\\\\* comprises regional services \\\\(Skumaster, labor planning, etc.\\\\), which do not have a specific warehouse identifier associated with them and asynchronous services \\\\(SNS, SQS, etc.\\\\). The regional services will either continue to operate from DUB, and serve clients in both the DUB and ZAZ regions or create a new stack is created in ZAZ, and ensure data consistency between the DUB and ZAZ stacks to maintain seamless service delivery to clients in their respective regions.
