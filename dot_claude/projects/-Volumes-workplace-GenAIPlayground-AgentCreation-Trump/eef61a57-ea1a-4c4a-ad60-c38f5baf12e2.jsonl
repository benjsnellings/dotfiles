CloudAuth allows clients to securely request resources from services across the Prod/Corp and Public AWS fabrics.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Why would I use CloudAuth? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nIf clients and services are running in different environments (Prod/Corp, Public AWS) or both client and services are in Public AWS and you need Authentication and Authorization support then CloudAuth is for you.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== When will CloudAuth be available in Public AWS/Prod/Corp? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth was released for General Availability on 2018-03-30 including support for Highly Confidential and Critical data services. To track continuing improvements support for new frameworks and new environments check the[[ UnifiedAuth Roadmap>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/Roadmap]].\\r\\n\\r\\n== CloudAuth Fundamentals ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What is a //resource server//? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nThe service hosting the protected resources, capable of and responding to resource requests from clients using access tokens.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What is the CloudAuth //auth server//? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nThe server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating all parties involved and obtaining authorization from AAA relationship data.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== How does CloudAuth work? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth follows the [[OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant flow>>https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4]].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic flow is as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The Client requests credentials for a specific resource, presenting it's credentials to the Auth Server\\r\\n1. The Auth Server authenticates the Client, determines permissions, and if they are granted issues the Client credentials in the form of a token\\r\\n1. The Client requests a resource from the Resource Server, presenting the token provided by the Auth Server\\r\\n1. The Resource Server requests that the Auth Server introspect the token, providing information about the validity of the token\\r\\n1. The Auth Server provides information about the token's validity, and the permissions it grants\\r\\n1. The Resource Server determines if the Client is authorized, and if so provides the resource\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce a Client has received a token, the token should be cached so the Client can continue to use the token for access until the token expires, or is rejected by the Resource Server. In the same way the Resource Server can cache the introspection response for a token, allowing the Resource Server to make authorization decisions when that token is presented again. This reduces the standard resource access flow to:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The Client requests resource, providing a token that grants access from it's cache\\r\\n1. The Resource Server makes an authorization decision based on cached introspection information, and provides the resource if the Client is authorized\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Does CloudAuth use standard OAuth2? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes.\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth passes some additional parameters as is allowed by the spec. These extra parameters have been written into a spec currently [[working towards approval by the OAuth 2.0 Working Group>>https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hardt-oauth-distributed-00]].\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What network fabrics does CloudAuth work in? Can I connect from Prod to Prod? Public AWS to public AWS? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth supports connectivity between any Amazon network fabrics.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Resource Server that accepts CloudAuth traffic can accept requests from //any CloudAuth client that can establish network connectivity// and meet two requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\n1. The request must be sent over a secure connection [[from end to end>>https://skb.highcastle.a2z.com/guides/128]]\\r\\n1. The client must have a valid AAA relationship for that connection (with appropriate cross security domain and [[cross region considerations>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AAA/Guide/Manage/Client/Request_Cross_Region_Exception]])\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes this mean CORP to PROD is supported? Yes\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes this mean PROD to public AWS is supported? Yes\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes this mean ~_~_~_~_~_~_~_~_ to ~_~_~_~_~_~_~_~_ is supported? Yes\\r\\n\\r\\n=== How do cross region calls work in CloudAuth? Do the client and resource server need to call CloudAuth in the same region? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth fully supports cross region calls. \\r\\n\\r\\nClients and resource servers do not need to call CloudAuth in the same region to make cross region calls. CloudAuth's auth servers recognize and validate CloudAuth tokens created in any region. Clients can request tokens from CloudAuth in one region (say us-west-2) and make calls to a resource server in another region (say us-east-1) who can introspect those tokens at CloudAuth in their local region (us-east-1).\\r\\n\\r\\n{{plantUML}}\\r\\n@startuml\\r\\nautonumber\\r\\ntitle Cross region calls with CloudAuth\\r\\n\\r\\nbox \\\"us-west-2\\\"\\r\\n participant \\\"Client in\\\\nus-west-2\\\\n(example)\\\" as c\\r\\n participant \\\"CloudAuth in\\\\nus-west-2\\\" as caw\\r\\nend box\\r\\nbox \\\"us-east-1\\\"\\r\\n participant \\\"Resource Server in\\\\nus-east-1\\\\n(example)\\\" as rs\\r\\n participant \\\"CloudAuth in\\\\nus-east-1\\\" as cae\\r\\nend box\\r\\n\\r\\nc -> rs: \\\\\\r\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t request <resource>\\r\\nc <- rs: \\\\\\r\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t401 UNAUTHORIZED\\\\n\\\\\\r\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t<CloudAuth challenge>\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\r\\nc -> caw: \\\\\\r\\n/token <CloudAuth challenge>\\r\\nc <- caw: \\\\\\r\\n<access token for resource server>\\r\\nc -> rs: \\\\\\r\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\trequest <resource>\\\\n\\\\\\r\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t<access token for resource server>\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\r\\nrs -> cae: \\\\\\r\\n/introspect\\\\n\\\\\\r\\n<access token for resource server>\\r\\nrs <- cae: \\\\\\r\\n<validated token claims>\\r\\nrs -> rs: \\\\\\r\\nauthorize client\\r\\nc <- rs: \\\\\\r\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t<resource>\\r\\n\\r\\n@enduml\\r\\n{{/plantUML}}\\r\\n\\r\\nCross region calls using CloudAuth are dependent on the permissions set for the resource at the resource server. When using AAA permissions cross region calls are enabled by default for all regions, excluding calls between China and other regions which [[require a cross region exception>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AAA/Guide/Manage/Client/Request_Cross_Region_Exception/]].\\r\\n\\r\\n== Alternatives to CloudAuth ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can I use AWS Auth instead even if I am not an AWS Service? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nAWS Auth is an internal service providing authentication and authorization services for AWS services. It can (and MUST) be used for any public AWS Service and can also be used for internal AWS Services (e.g. for service to service communications between different service components).\\r\\n\\r\\nAWS Auth is usable by teams outside of AWS in a limited capacity. Because AWS Auth is really only available to AWS teams a service wanting to use AWS Auth must use an AWS service like Api Gateway or ALB to perform per request auth. Services going this route [[should re-establish TLS>>https://skb.highcastle.a2z.com/guides/128]] between the load balancer (Api Gateway or ALB) and their backend hosts.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore detail [[here - Can I use AWS Auth if I am not an AWS Service?>>https://w.amazon.com/index.php/AWSAuth/FAQ#Can_I_use_AWS_Auth_if_I_am_not_an_AWS_Service.3F]].\\r\\n\\r\\n=== AWS IAM Service to Service Authentication migration to CloudAuth FAQs ===\\r\\n\\r\\n**~1. My application already use AWS IAM with API Gateway for Service to Service to Authentication, why should I migrate to CloudAuth?**\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth is the approved paved path solution for all Ring 0 and 1 SDO teams as per Security Expectations 3. AWSAuth (through API Gateway and STS) is not approved because of the following security benefits from CloudAuth. Non-Ring 0 and 1 applications are good to use AWSAuth (through API Gateway and STS).\\r\\n\\r\\n* CloudAuth is built on AAA control plane which helps manage relationships to multiple clients\\r\\n* CloudAuth provides differentiated features like integration with transitive auth (TA token propagation) and will provide differentiated features in the future, such as transitive auth token issuance (TA-STS), delegated auth, and pluggable authorization (See Roadmap for more details). These features are not available with SIGv4.\\r\\n* Infosec is building tooling to leverage CloudAuth and AAA logs to increase security across SDO.\\r\\n* Consistency across SDO applications\\r\\n* Integrated with Amazon's frameworks (Coral, ARest, BSF, Horizonte), libraries (Gizmo throttling, metrics)\\r\\n* Highly performant\\r\\n* Supports multiple client authentication types (IAM, AAA TLS, with Midway/Federate coming soon)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Below are some trade-offs to consider while using CloudAuth:**\\r\\n\\r\\n* Latency at startup\\r\\n* Applications with high service call volumes should plan for increased availability requirements and costs due to Lambda invocations from unauthenticated callers that were previously managed by API Gateway (this also applies to other computing options such as ECS).\\r\\n* CloudAuth is in limited regions (see here for a list of current regions supported; see the roadmap for upcoming regions)\\r\\n* Community supported in most languages\\r\\n\\r\\n**Trade-offs of choosing AWS Auth:**\\r\\n\\r\\n* incur the cost of APIGateway (expensive and latent)\\r\\n* incur the additional client cost of signing every transaction\\r\\n* limited to no visibility into authN/authZ errors\\r\\n* no integration support for transitive auth\\r\\n* manually manage changing policies for new clients and existing clients\\r\\n** manage the lifecycle and permissions of the clients and service (who does this account belong to? how do I page them?)\\r\\n** handle the distribution of consumer API keys for throttling as part of onboarding\\r\\n** handle the distribution of policy API keys that are used as ‘roles’ as part of onboarding\\r\\n** handle the tracking/rotation/revocation of the above keys or build a self-service UI that wraps AWS to do this on your behalf, in which case, you now build and manage your own mini-AAA\\r\\n* go through a security review, this is highly confidential data when in bulk\\r\\n* create the audit logs and provide them to InfoSec if required\\r\\n* create the logging and metrics for the above\\r\\n\\r\\n**2. Does migrating from AWS IAM to CloudAuth increase DDoS risks?**\\r\\n\\r\\nThis migration approach does not introduce additional DDoS risks, as confirmed by CloudAuth through validation with API Gateway and Lambda service teams.\\r\\n\\r\\n==== Other Benefits of CloudAuth ====\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Enable fine grained access control (FGAC). TransitiveAuth (TA) adoption is critical to enable FGAC across SDO data custodian services. By EOY 2025, we will have TA coverage across all existing CloudAuth services, however there is still a large gap (~~20k) of services remaining across SDO that are not in the CloudAuth \\\"fabric\\\" and therefore not on TransitiveAuth. This poses a Security / FGAC risk as requests originating from these non-CloudAuth services are not initiating TA tokens, therefore the TA token that is eventually generated downstream does not contain the \\\"true initiator identity\\\" for the data custodians / data stewards to base their FGAC policy decision upon. Driving CA adoption across all remaining services in 2026 will ensure the \\\"true initiator\\\" services are initiating the TA tokens. The CloudAuth team is also investing in FGAC pre-compute capabilities to further simplify FGAC onboarding and enforcement. UnifiedAuth plans to precompute certain fine-grained access control (FGAC) permissions for a given call graph with specified mission and context. Precomputed permission will be minted in TA tokens which will reduce call chain failures at data custodians and surface issues at initiator level.\\r\\n1. **Region Flex (RFE) Enablement: **\\r\\n\\\\\\\\2.1) Region-flexibility for NAWS services: NAWS API gateway services use sigv4 for IAM auth. Sigv4 include a single region in the signing, which means a request signed for a region can only process in that region. This breaks RFE initiatives such as LRA which are removing dependency on specific region. RFE’s preferred and long-term approach is using CloudAuth for NAWS services [while we are looking at short-term workarounds such as sigv4a].\\r\\n\\\\\\\\2.2) SDO service graph: RFE’s rub-experience and region migration guidance relies on discovery dependencies. Today we have limited coverage, especially on NAWS. CloudAuth everywhere combined with CloudAuth usage metrics and Axon integration increases the coverage.\\r\\n\\\\\\\\2.3) Resource relationship and discovery: For resource discovery RFE starts with pipelines and “infers” relationships and resources. The inference introduces inaccuracies. For example, to identify a service’s FQDN, the current path is pipeline → [infer AAA application] → Endpoints. With CloudAuth everywhere, we can use AAA IDs as the starting point removing the inference step.\\r\\n\\\\\\\\2.4) Runtime “who am I” across SDO: For use-case such as traffic shifting, customers are asking for a context that allows them to move traffic from certain callers before others.\\r\\n\\\\\\\\2.5) Less variety: With initiative like RFE one of the major challenges is the variety across SDO. We often are forced to provide accelerators and solutions that have limited coverage. Using CloudAuth everywhere for service↔service AuthNZ allows us to reach more with doing less. For example, LRA and TSA’s are not available for endpoints that are not registered with UnifiedAuth.\\r\\n1. Improve SDO business outcomes leveraging Agentic AI: The Applied AI group is working with UnifiedAuth (owners of CloudAuth CA & TransitiveAuth TA) as the AuthN and AuthZ service to secure interactions between AI agent applications and Amazon internal webtools (e.g., Harmony, Purchase Order Portal, etc.). CA & TA will validate service-to-service communications, ensuring only authorized AI agents can access protected resources. While existing midway support for human AuthN and AuthZ will remain unchanged, our mental model conceptualizes AI Agent access to WebTools as service to service interactions, distinct from human-to-service interactions. A critical component of this architecture is TA token support across SDO and AWS, which enables agentic AI identity & security context propagation across SDO & AWS call graphs - essential for auditing and fine-grained access control decisions. As SDO evolves to incorporate Agentic AI, where AI bots act on behalf of employees or customers across browsers and web portals, the security context propagation requirements become more complex. Beyond traditional actor identity and attributes, it becomes crucial to propagate and maintain context about both the AI bot and the principal (human) on whose behalf it's acting. This dual-context propagation is essential for data custodians to perform fine-grained authorization decisions and maintain comprehensive audit trails. When investigating data access patterns or security incidents, organizations must be able to distinguish whether actions were initiated directly by humans or by AI agents. This requirement adds a new dimension to the existing TA token structure, potentially necessitating additional context attributes to capture the AI agent's identity, permissions scope, and delegation chain. Such context becomes particularly critical in scenarios involving sensitive operations or when complying with regulations that may have specific requirements for automated processing of customer data.\\r\\n1. Compliance and Business Opportunity: There are a variety of existing and upcoming regulatory and compliance requirements that require security context propagation (via TransitiveAuth), as well as FGAC enforcement (via UAAL pluggable auth solutions). As noted above, services on CloudAuth get TA & Pluggable AuthN / AuthZ by default, which negates the need for undifferentiated service owner effort to onboard to each of these solutions (e.g. TA, Helis, Bindles) separately. Examples of Regulations Requiring FGAC Enforcement: DMA, Quebec Privacy Law, GDPR, etc. Examples of Certifications Requiring FGAC Enforcement: SOC 2 Type 2 (Supply Chain by Amazon, Santos targeting to achieve this to unblock large enterprise customers).\\r\\n1. UnifiedAuth Abstraction Layer (UAAL): UAAL is an abstraction layer provided by CloudAuth. It provides a standardized set of interfaces for interacting with SDO's auth landscape for Access Control. UAAL allows for service owners across SDO to make and enforce authorization decisions at runtime. With UAAL, CloudAuth acts as an orchestrator across SDOs identity, context and policy providers. UAAL allows SDO service owners to apply Company, Organization and Team wide Access Control policies. Policies are prioritized, Company > Organization > Time wide Access Control policies. UAAL leverages the “pluggable authN/Z” capabilitiy from UnifiedAuth, abstracting away service owner custom integration with solutions like Midway, Federate, Helis, Bindles, etc.\\r\\n1. Automated Audit Trail: CloudAuth has integrated with SEL, enabling 0 effort SEL onboarding for any service on CloudAuth.\\r\\n1. Prod / Non Prod: CloudAuth-based solution that allows security teams to build detection of unapproved calls from non-production environments to production services. We will then extend CloudAuth’s service-to-service policy definition and enforcement mechanisms to allow service owners to prevent calls to production services from non-production environments unless explicitly approved via policy exceptions (and vice versa).\\r\\n1. Axon integration w/ CloudAuth - planning on building this in 2025.Observability: CloudAuth's strategic position in the infrastructure provides unique opportunities for comprehensive observability. Being present at every service-to-service intersection and serving 35K services (growing 25% YoY), CloudAuth can collect and process an impressive 1 billion data points every 5 minutes. This massive data collection, combined with AI-powered analytics, can transform raw telemetry into actionable insights, enabling real-time monitoring, automated root cause analysis, streamlined compliance reporting, and detailed usage pattern tracking. This improved observability creates a powerful flywheel effect: better telemetry leads to richer insights, enabling more automation, which reduces builder effort and encourages broader adoption, ultimately generating even more comprehensive telemetry data.\\r\\n1. CloudAuth enables per-client throttling\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Is AWSAuth a valid alternative (to CloudAuth)? ===\\r\\n\\r\\n[[CloudAuth is recommended solution for SDO teams>>https://skb.highcastle.a2z.com/recommendations/22]], however AWSAuth is a valid alternative (through API Gateway and STS).

CloudAuth is still authentication and authorization. Unlike AAA,-Symmetric/AAA-TLS it is based on the public OAuth 2.0 standard, as well as TLS.\\r\\nImplementation-wise, CloudAuth uses AAA relationships. Client identities are all specified within AAA, so when a client (resource servers are still clients of CloudAuth) assert (prove) their identities, it is mapped to a AAA Application. This is either done using AAA-TLS certificates when in the Prod network or IAM role credentials when in Prod/AWS.\\r\\n1. This is beneficial in that it is a well known and audited protocol. There are also publicly-maintained clients that we can take advantage of (with some modification as we also use [[Distributed OAuth>>url:https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hardt-oauth-distributed-00]]).\\r\\n1. It **requires** TLS end-to-end support. Without TLS E-E, you are not allowed to use CloudAuth (that is, all resource servers and auth servers **must** deny access if the connection isn't secure). AAA-Symmetric only encrypts the payload, not the headers.—The reason is historical; Netscalar load balancers actually proxy connections, so load balancers can see the contents of any SSL VIP connection; so encrypting the payload separately makes AAA-Symmetric connections secure from load balancers.—But OAuth passes credentials (tokens) through headers.

A service that only supports CloudAuth doesn't need to run the AAASecurityDaemon daemon or take any code dependencies AAA-Symmetric/AAA-TLS libraries.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmazon services and their clients may authenticate using one of two methods, [[SigV4 signature generated using IAM Role credentials>>Coral.Manual.CloudAuth||anchor=\\\"HCodetosetupyourCloudAuthcredentials\\\"]] or [[AAA mutual TLS>>Coral.Manual.CloudAuth||anchor=\\\"HCreatewithAAA-TLS\\\"]].\\r\\n\\r\\nFor clients running in public AWS, especially in dynamic runtimes like ECS or Lambda, IAM Role credentials are recommended.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor clients running MAWS either authentication method can be used, IAM credentials are probably easiest unless your service already has AAA TLS credentials (i.e. is running the AAA Security Daemon).\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can I support AAA-Symmetric/AAA-TLS and CloudAuth traffic on the same service? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes. This is well supported in Coral, ARest, and BSF.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe service will need a TLS endpoint, on host if it's in PROD, to support CloudAuth traffic.\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth and AAA-Symmetric/AAA-TLS should be run as independent authorizers, each rendering their own authorization decision. \\r\\n\\r\\nExample implementation can be found here: [[https:~~/~~/code.amazon.com/packages/HowToUseCloudAuthWithCoral/blobs/2530dc083ddea30046a76b897dfc554620cf3ace/~~-~~-/src/com/amazon/HowToUseCloudAuthWithCoral/modules/CloudAuthWithAAAModule.java#L19>>url:https://code.amazon.com/packages/HowToUseCloudAuthWithCoral/blobs/2530dc083ddea30046a76b897dfc554620cf3ace/--/src/com/amazon/HowToUseCloudAuthWithCoral/modules/CloudAuthWithAAAModule.java#L19]]\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can I use CloudAuth to call an AAA-Symmetric/AAA-TLS protected service? Can I use AAA-Symmetric/AAA-TLS to call a CloudAuth protected service? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. \\r\\n\\r\\nAAA-Symmetric/AAA-TLS and CloudAuth are independent protocols, so credentials from one protocol cannot be used to access resources from another.\\r\\n\\r\\nA resource (service) can be protected with both protocols, accepting calls from clients using either.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can a service protected by AAA-Symmetric/AAA-TLS make calls to a service protected by CloudAuth? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe AAA service will be acting as a client of the CloudAuth protected service, so the AAA protected service will have to create CloudAuth credentials for authenticating. the AAA service won't need to complete CloudAuth onboarding as a resource server, but will need to complete the [[client onboarding>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/Onboarding/OnboardingClients]]. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe authorization system/protocol a service uses to protect its resources is independent of the authorization it uses to make calls, as a client, to other services. CloudAuth protected services can make calls to services protected by AAA, and AAA protected services can make calls to services protected by CloudAuth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe protocols are independent and cover a single link in the graph.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Does CloudAuth support AAA-Symmetric passthrough mode? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CloudAuth protocol doesn't support an idea of Passthrough mode, but does work with services using AAA-Symmetric for Passthrough mode.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to a bug in the Authorization handler used by our frameworks unauthenticated requests to a service protected with CloudAuth and AAA with operations in Passthrough Mode will be rejected with a 401 http status code. As a result, existing clients not making AAA enabled requests will be rejected. The fix for this bug [[is on a branch>>https://code.amazon.com/packages/CoralAAAAuthorizer/logs/heads/passthrough]] and will be pushed to live once better tested. \\r\\n\\r\\n(% style=\\\"font-size:16px\\\" %)**Disclaimer**\\r\\n\\r\\nOperations in AAA Passthrough Mode approve all requests. In Coral and ARest an approve from any authorizer in the chain is treated as authoritative. This means the AAA Authorizer's decision to approve requests to passthrough operations supersedes any other decision, approving the request. Clients attempting to use CloudAuth will be approved, as will existing clients using AAA, as will any calling client. \\r\\n\\r\\nPassthrough was created for services adopting AAA as a way to allow them to onboard clients without interrupting service. Once all clients were AAA enabled a service was supposed to migrate to enforcement mode. The persistence of passthrough mode indicates that this approach wasn't successful. CloudAuth chose not to recreate it.\\r\\n\\r\\n(% style=\\\"font-size:16px\\\" %)**Coral 1.1**\\r\\n\\r\\nCoral 1.1 has a branch to support services protected with CloudAuth and AAA with operations in Passthrough Mode. To use this branch, build the \\\"passthrough\\\" branch into your version set. \\r\\n\\r\\n[[https:~~/~~/code.amazon.com/packages/CoralAAAAuthorizer/logs/heads/passthrough>>url:https://code.amazon.com/packages/CoralAAAAuthorizer/logs/heads/passthrough]]\\r\\n\\r\\n(% style=\\\"font-size:16px\\\" %)**ARest**\\r\\n\\r\\nARest support is currently being designed. \\r\\n\\r\\n(% style=\\\"font-size:16px\\\" %)**BSF C++**\\r\\n\\r\\nBSF C++ officially supports services protected with CloudAuth and AAA with operations in Passthrough Mode.\\r\\n\\r\\n(% style=\\\"font-size:16px\\\" %)**BSF Java**\\r\\n\\r\\nSee [[BSF allow listing>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BSF/CloudAuth/#Hallowlisting]]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can CloudAuth and AAA-Symmetric be used together in the same service? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, assuming your service is already using AAA-Symmetric (if not see our question on supporting AAA-Symmetric in new services).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a service receives a request that's been signed and encrypted with AAA-Symmetric, it verifies authorization using the AAA Security Daemon. When a request is received over HTTPS that includes a CloudAuth token, it is verified using the CloudAuth //auth server//. When a request is received over HTTPS that does not include a CloudAuth token, the response is a CloudAuth challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== After my service onboards with CloudAuth, can I drop AAA-Symmetric protocol support? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYour current clients authenticate to your services using AAA and they will continue to do so unless they migrate to CloudAuth. As long as you have heterogeneous client base, you should continue to support AAA (for existing clients) and CloudAuth (for new clients) in parallel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you 'drop' AAA-Symmetric protocol support, you no longer allow clients to use AAA-signed requests to access your service. Any clients that have continued to use AAA will retrieve either 403 errors (if using HTTP) or 401 errors with a challenge (if using HTTPS).\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce all of your AAA clients onboard with CloudAuth and authenticate with your service using CloudAuth, you may drop AAA protocol support.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be clear, AAA is still always used as the source of authentication and authorization information, which is used by CloudAuth. So you still need to create a AAA application and a AAA service.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== My service is already using AAA-Symmetric but needs to call a CloudAuth protected service. Do I need to onboard as a CloudAuth client? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, you'll need to onboard your service to CloudAuth as a client to access the CloudAuth protected service. \\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth and AAA-Symmetric communicate authentication information and make authorization decisions in [[very different ways>>Dev.CDO.UnifiedAuth.CloudAuth.FAQ.WebHome||anchor=\\\"HHowisCloudAuthdifferentfromAAA3F\\\"]]. Due to these differences services must onboard directly with the protocol (either CloudAuth or AAA-Symmetric)they need to use to access a resource.\\r\\n\\r\\n== Adopting CloudAuth ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== I am creating a new service, should I use CloudAuth? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nAbsolutely! CloudAuth is the successor to AAA-Symmetric supporting both AWS and Prod runtimes, and long term strategy for authentication and authorization in Amazon. If you are building a new service, CloudAuth is all you need.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== I am creating a new service, should I also support AAA-Symmetric? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. AAA-Symmetric is being sunset.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What are prerequisites to using CloudAuth? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are only a [[few requirements>>Dev\\\\.CDO.UnifiedAuth.CloudAuth.Onboarding.Prerequisites.]].\\r\\n\\r\\n1. All traffic between the service clients and the resource server must be running over HTTPS.\\r\\n1. Private Links need to be created between the various services and to CloudAuth.\\r\\n1. Service Owners will need to create or update their AAA service profiles with IAM roles.\\r\\n1. Each service client and resource server will also need to be updated to include OAuth code. AREST, Coral and BSF Java and C++ framework upgrades are available.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore details are available in [[CloudAuth Onboarding>>Dev\\\\.CDO.UnifiedAuth.CloudAuth.Onboarding.]].\\r\\n\\r\\n=== If migrating an existing service from Prod/Corp to Public AWS, do AAA relationships need to be recreated? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. You can use your existing AAA relationships. However, CloudAuth introduces OAuth scopes which can greatly simplify the creation and maintenance of AAA Relationships. There are additional steps to onboard with CloudAuth. See [[CloudAuth Onboarding>>Dev\\\\.CDO.UnifiedAuth.CloudAuth.Onboarding.]].\\r\\n\\r\\n=== For a AAA-enabled service in Prod/Corp, what must be done for clients to call it from Public AWS? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a few options to allow clients to call your Prod service from Public AWS.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf your clients are using EC2 runtimes, you can simply create an Allegiance/PrivateLink endpoint that your clients can call and register your IAM roles with the AAA UI. This will allow your clients (using EC2) to call your Prod-based service using AAA-Symmetric. See [[C2S service auth for Public AWS>>C2S.NativeAWSServiceAuth.]] for more.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf your clients are using other AWS runtimes, Lambda/ECS, then you will need to onboard your service to CloudAuth. See [[detailed onboarding steps>>Dev\\\\.CDO.UnifiedAuth.CloudAuth.Onboarding.]].\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Which operations should I request access to in the AAA dashboard? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a client, you need to request the **getToken** operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a resource server, you need to request the **getToken**, **bootstrap**, and **introspect** operations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above operations requests are automatically approved for all applications and generally don't require any justification. If you request other operations than the above, your request will be delayed until someone has a chance to approve this request. If your application needs access to some of the lesser used features of CloudAuth, please include a justification message for these.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Do I need an AAA relationship if I'm using AWSAuth? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, you don't need an AAA relationship if the resource is protected by AWSAuth. AWSAuth and CloudAuth are different protocols, AAA relationships only apply to CloudAuth/AAA protected traffic.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Why is my AAA relationship request delayed? ===\\r\\n\\r\\n{{transclude name=\\\"space:Dev\\\\.CDO.UnifiedAuth.CloudAuth.Onboarding.PauseMessage.AAARelationship\\\"/}}\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to reduce the amount of time spent authorizing access requests for every application at Amazon, AAA automatically approves the **getToken**, **bootstrap**, and **introspect** operations. If any other operations are requested then this delays the approval. Unless you know that you need operations not in the above list, please cancel the request and resubmit your request.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Why do I see a \\\"You are not done!\\\" banner on the AAA dashboard? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a bug in AAA, please follow [[https:~~/~~/issues.amazon.com/issues/AAABACKLOG-1809?title=AAAFrontendWebsite-You-are-not-done!-banner-remains-after-CloudAuth-Onboarding>>url:https://issues.amazon.com/issues/AAABACKLOG-1809?title=AAAFrontendWebsite-You-are-not-done!-banner-remains-after-CloudAuth-Onboarding]] for more details\\r\\n\\r\\n== Using CloudAuth in Prod ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Does CloudAuth support a Prod-Prod use case? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes. CloudAuth doesn't care where the client or resource server are. These are treated equally:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Laptops on the Amazon network\\r\\n* The Corp network\\r\\n* One of the many, regional Prod networks\\r\\n* Public AWS (but not CN)\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Prod services may only support CloudAuth for authorization, and not AAA.\\r\\n\\r\\n== Using CloudAuth in public AWS ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can CloudAuth be used from Lambda/ECS/EMR/Fargate? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes. CloudAuth was designed specifically to support these AWS resources. To use CloudAuth, you need to be able to assume an IAM role and make a call to authorization server to receive an OAuth access token that you can use to call the appropriate resource service.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can Lambda + API Gateway be used as a resource server? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes. CloudAuth is agnostic to the compute platform. CloudAuth only requires the platform provide support for a secure channel to transmit bearer tokens.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo use API Gateway as a proxy with Lambda, you will:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. create a public endpoint and DNS record that clients use access the API. Using a VPC //private endpoint// (or //service endpoint//) only makes the API accessible from within that account, but not from other accounts. But you can always make a //regional// domain name, a public DNS CNAME like ##myapi.us-west-2.myproject.a2z.com## (see [[Nova>>Nova.]]).\\r\\n1. configure API Gateway to use NONE authorization (##AWS_IAM## requires you to sign your request into the ##Authorization## header)\\r\\n1. use a supported library such as ARest-Server-CloudAuth or CloudAuthResourceServerLibJava directly (Java only today)\\r\\n\\r\\nTo run a Lambda resource server, you will:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. follow our [[resource server onboarding guide>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/C2S/CloudAuth/Onboarding/OnboardingResourceServers/#HResourceServerinNativeAWSsupportingClientsinNativeAWS]] for a service that supports both Prod and AWS clients. The only difference between the two sets of steps is who manages your Private Link (AWS -> AWS = you, Prod -> AWS = Allegiance), which doesn't actually matter to you because your API Gateway needs to be public for now anyway (see the private API [[tracking issue>>url:https://i.amazon.com/issues/BPL-8668]]). Other than that, you should be able to create a Private Link from your Lambda's VPC to CloudAuth's service and add the necessary CloudAuth packages in order to get working.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are limitations to this solution that you should consider:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **(MOST IMPORTANT) **API Gateway has support for custom authorization. Response from AWS Lambda (your resource server) will be translated into 200, 401, and 403 response codes **WITHOUT** custom information. See the [[tracking SIM to CloudAuth team>>https://issues.amazon.com/issues/CloudAuth-606/]] and the [[SIM to APIG team>>https://issues.amazon.com/issues/APLUS-4144]] for details\\r\\n1. If you're using a framework (Coral, AREST, etc), the integration with CloudAuth will be easier, but the cold-start time may be high - this now is partially improved by [[PreAuth>>https://issues.amazon.com/CloudAuth-3119]] but it's still a performance problem.\\r\\n1. Caching of CloudAuth tokens/introspection results is less effective causing higher request latency outliers\\r\\n\\r\\nRef: [[https:~~/~~/sage.amazon.com/questions/451690>>url:https://sage.amazon.com/questions/451690]] [[https:~~/~~/sage.amazon.com/questions/494731>>url:https://sage.amazon.com/questions/494731]]\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Are there any special requirements when using CloudAuth from Lambda? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, in order to work correctly, a Lambda that is using CloudAuth requires three things.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, please be sure to follow your team, org, or the company's latest best practices for writing a Lambda which is sufficiently secure for handling your data. CloudAuth endpoints can be accessed either via the public internet or via a private link to CloudAuth's VPC.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond apply the {{code}}AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole{{/code}} IAM policy to your Lambda's IAM Role.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, since CloudAuth's API Gateway is used over the internet, your Lambda will need internet access via a NAT Gateway (if it doesn't already have public internet access). This is generally accomplished by running a Lambda in a private subnet, using a NAT Gateway in the public subnet, and routing public subnet traffic through an Internet Gateway.

The service owner defines a set of actions that are allowable on that stream and Coral will enforce that no other actions are permitted by default.\\r\\n\\\\\\\\This means CloudAuth, and Coral’s integration with CloudAuth should just work. When a client opens a stream, they present a CloudAuth token via a header at the start of the HTTP request authorizing the client for the stream. Once the client has been authorized data can be streamed without subsequent authZ checks as Coral will reject anything not modeled for that stream.\\r\\n\\\\\\\\There are a couple of open questions.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. What should happen to the stream when the client's authorization state changes (say a token expires, or is revoked). Coral’s suggestion was to limit all streams to 5 min max to address this scenario without additional code.\\r\\n1. Security review. To the best of my knowledge this plan hasn't been formally reviewed with InfoSec (it may have been informally reviewed by some security folks). It’s worth running this past your security team before rolling it to production.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s a deeper discussion in this CloudAuth office hours ticket https://issues.amazon.com/issues/UnifiedAuth-7281[[https://issues.amazon.com/issues/UnifiedAuth-7281]].\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Which languages have community-supported packages for CloudAuth? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are vended by the community, use with caution and give back if you find problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nChoosing one of these packages is //choosing to support yourself//, you are not guaranteed support, help, speedy response, or that the maintainers still work at Amazon.

The client must choose which region it is interacting with to ensure that it uses the correct regional signature. These CloudAuth packages are vended by the community and are not supported by cloud auth. You should feel empowered to add support for regional endpoints by following the [[CloudAuth Implementers Guide>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/Implementers_Guide/#HModifyopen-sourceOAuth2.0libraries]].\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What if my language isn't in this list? Can I use a standard OAuth2 library? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nFor applications that don't expose inbound APIs (and so just need CloudAuth to make outbound calls to dependencies), we offer the **CloudAuth Omnis Client**, a language-agnostic solution that enables services unable to use CloudAuth SDKs to call dependencies via CloudAuth.

There are some restrictions with its use - these are called out in the onboarding guide.\\r\\n\\r\\nOtherwise, yes, CloudAuth is just an implementation of OAuth 2.0, ... kinda.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a few modifications necessary to most open source clients to make them work with CloudAuth. Depending on the quality of the library this ranges from simple to difficult. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor more information see the [[CloudAuth Implementers Guide>>Dev\\\\.CDO.UnifiedAuth.CloudAuth.Implementers_Guide.||anchor=\\\"HModifyopen-sourceOAuth2.0libraries\\\"]].\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Does CloudAuth support calls from the Client direct to a Resource Server host? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe challenges and details are captured in our wiki about the [[host and realm parameters>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/OAuth/HostParameter/]].  \\r\\n\\r\\n=== What public AWS compute environments are supported by CloudAuth and AAA? ===\\r\\n\\r\\n(% border=\\\"1\\\" style=\\\"width:818px\\\" %)\\r\\n|(% style=\\\"width:341px\\\" %)Public AWS Compute Environment / Auth Protocol|(% style=\\\"width:116px\\\" %)CloudAuth|(% style=\\\"width:136px\\\" %)CloudAuth - Vended Identity|(% style=\\\"width:175px\\\" %)AAA-Symmetric|(% style=\\\"width:123px\\\" %)AAA-TLS\\r\\n|(% style=\\\"width:341px\\\" %)EC2|(% style=\\\"width:116px\\\" %)Supported|(% style=\\\"width:136px\\\" %)3/30/20|(% style=\\\"width:175px\\\" %)Supported|(% style=\\\"width:123px\\\" %)Supported\\r\\n|(% style=\\\"width:341px\\\" %)ECS / Fargate|(% style=\\\"width:116px\\\" %)Supported|(% style=\\\"width:136px\\\" %)3/30/20|(% style=\\\"width:175px\\\" %)12/31/19 (client only)|(% style=\\\"width:123px\\\" %)Not Supported\\r\\n|(% style=\\\"width:341px\\\" %)Lambda|(% style=\\\"width:116px\\\" %)Supported|(% style=\\\"width:136px\\\" %)3/30/20|(% style=\\\"width:175px\\\" %)12/31/19 (client only)|(% style=\\\"width:123px\\\" %)Not Supported\\r\\n\\r\\n=== How can I use CDK constructs to develop with CloudAuth? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nSee this High Castle guidance for more information: https://highcastle.a2z.com/#/blueprints/metadata/c805cf65-0ed2-4213-8d26-a973ccb078ae\\r\\n\\r\\n=== How can Away Team members work with CloudAuth? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth’s permissions and identity information are modeled in the AAA datastore. Users of CloudAuth register their AWS identities (IAM Roles) and Apollo Environments within their AAA Application. Environments that have access to those identities are then able to run as the given AAA Application.\\r\\n\\r\\n==== Workflow For Public AWS Users ====\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The away team sets up their own AWS account or is granted access to sandboxed/devo account from the host team.\\r\\n1. The away team creates an IAM Role\\r\\n1. Host team adds IAM Role to AAA application\\r\\n1. The away team deploys the host service infrastructure to their account with the new execution role\\r\\n\\r\\n==== Workflow for MAWS Users ====\\r\\n\\r\\n===== Using AWS Credentials =====\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The host team creates an IAM Role ([[frequently through using Conduit>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Conduit/IAM_Guide/]])\\r\\n1. Host team adds IAM Role to AAA application\\r\\n1. Host team grants the away team permissions to consume the IAM Role (frequently through Odin)\\r\\n1. Away team deploys the service to their host\\r\\n1*. Note: if calls to the AAA application will be made from the dev desktop, then it is necessary to enable this access.  There are two options:\\r\\n1**. Option 1: Generic \\\"desktop.<service>.a2z.com\\\" endpoint and developers update their hosts file to point \\\"desktop.<service>.a2z.com\\\" to their localhost\\r\\n1***. this has the advantage of not requiring additional endpoint manipulation in AAA's datastore. Away team would just need access to the redfort certificate, which is easily added/revoked in Odin.\\r\\n1***.

Up-to-date information on our current rate limits are available on [[our SLA page>>Dev\\\\.CDO.UnifiedAuth.CloudAuth.SLA.WebHome||anchor=\\\"HServiceLevelObjectives28SLO29\\\"]].\\r\\n\\r\\n== Client Identity ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What client information does CloudAuth provide? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CloudAuth token contains Client ID value ({{code}}client_id{{/code}}). Applications can depend on the value as an opaque (canonical and stable) string for permitted proposes. Applications **SHOULD NOT** depend on the format of the ID (for example, applications **SHOULD NOT** parse the value into components) or use the value for other purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nPermitted purposes are:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Client-specific metrics/alarms\\r\\n* Client-specific throttling configuration\\r\\n* Application and access logging\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecifically excluded purposes included:\\r\\n\\r\\n* custom authorization ([[Vended Identity>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/Onboarding/VendedIdentity]] is the supported alternative)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe value depends on how the client authenticated with CloudAuth.\\r\\n\\r\\n* AAA-TLS: {{code}}\\\"client_id\\\":\\\"urn:cdo:<AAA Application Name>:<Test | Prod>:<Default | CN>\\\"{{/code}}\\r\\n* IAM roles: {{code}}\\\"client_id\\\":\\\"urn:cdo:<AAA Application Name>:AWS:<Default | CN>\\\"{{/code}}\\r\\n\\r\\n==== Why? ====\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the value is stable, taking a dependency on the format of identity strings has caused prior outages.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmazon's authentication and authorization systems may need to change this value in the future, changes will be well communicated and carefully rolled out, including how to update configurations referencing up to update from existing opaque client_id values to new client_id values. The fact that an application wrote custom parsing logic for the ##client_id## will not be taken as reason not to retain the existing value. If the ##client_id## changes teams will be expected to update their code and will be broken if they do not.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a service chooses to parse ##client_id## the service must define its behavior in the event that ##client_id## absent or it cannot be parsed and must have that behavior security reviewed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth currently does not support the [[Additional Information>>AAA.AdditionalInformation.]] that some teams use to store additional client information.\\r\\n\\r\\nCustomers requiring additional client identity information to perform custom authorization should onboard to [[Vended Identity>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/Onboarding/VendedIdentity]].\\r\\n\\r\\n== Vended Identity ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== I am filling out a [[SIM>>https://issues.amazon.com/issues/create?assignedFolder=3dc72621-4052-4654-9bb4-0d0eb92644f6&title=Onboarding+to+Vended+Identity+for+%5Byour+service+name%5D&description=**Your+Service+Name**+%0A%0A**Approval+from+InfoSec**++-+CloudAuth+store+is+already+approved+by+InfoSec+as+policy+engine+to+be+used+across+CDO.+If+you%E2%80%99re+using+a+custom+authorization+solution+requiring+AAA+or+IAM+Identity+information%2C+you+need+infoSec+approval.+Once+you+have+that%2C+have+InfoSec+put+a+comment+here%2C+or+you+can+reference+the+ticket+or+email..etc.%0A%0A**Required+identity+data+**+-+AAA+id%2C+application+name%2C+environment%2FIAM+role+name%2C+region%2C+what+are+you+after%3F%0A%0A**CloudAuth+Client+Id**+-+in+the+format+of+%3Cfully+qualified+domain+name%3E%2F%3Cservice+name%3E+%28must+be+an+exact+match%29%0A%0A**Redirect+URL**+-+The+url+that+CloudAuth+redirects+the+customer+to+%28must+be+an+exact+match%29%0A&descriptionContentType=text%2Famz-markdown-sim&extensions%5Btt%5D%5Bcategory%5D=]] to onboard to Vended Identity and it's asking for a redirect uri, what is the redirect uri? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease refer to our [[sequence diagrams>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/OIDC/SequenceDiagrams/]]. A high level summary of the sequence diagram is this:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Clients call the resource server without a valid identity token.\\r\\n1. The resource server redirects clients to CloudAuth to get an identity token, along with a **redirect_uri** query parameter.\\r\\n1. Clients ask CloudAuth for an identity token, and includes the **redirect_uri** in the request.\\r\\n1. CloudAuth validates that the **redirect_uri** is configured for the resource server.\\r\\n1. CloudAuth sends the client a 302 redirect to the **redirect_uri**, along with their identity token.\\r\\n1. Client makes a request to the **redirect_uri** with their identity token\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What if I need to migrate my Vended Identity Redirect URI? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth allows resource servers to register multiple Redirect URIs.\\r\\n\\r\\nredirect_uris are specified by the resource server. Resource servers redirect clients to the CloudAuth server and provide a redirect_uri via query parameters (reference our [[sequence diagrams>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/OIDC/SequenceDiagrams/#HResourceServerRedirect]]). Clients then make an /authorization_grant request against CloudAuth server with the same redirect_uri provided. CloudAuth matches the provided redirect_uri against those configured as acceptable by the resource server.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis way resource servers can register their new redirect_uri with CloudAuth and begin using it at their own pace.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== I want to onboard to vended identity, but my service uses REST apis so I can't possibly register all the possible Redirect URIs ===\\r\\n\\r\\nThe redirect_uri specified by the resource server's redirect to the auth server does NOT have to exactly match the REST API requested by the client. Instead, resource servers can use the state parameter defined by the [[OpenID spec>>https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest]] and noted in our [[sequence diagrams>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/OIDC/SequenceDiagrams/#HResourceServerRedirect]] to send some sort of token indicating where the original request was sent. Quoting the OpenID spec the state variable is an \\\"Opaque value used to maintain state between the request and the callback\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, services authenticating human users should create a login_successful endpoint and use state either to capture the original request information and serve it from there.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor services only using software clients, you could use state to redirect the client back to the resource they originally requested from a login_successful endpoint.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Which Scopes Do I Need? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nScopes are space-delimited values. In order to receive an identity token from the client's /authorization_grant request the client must request the {{code}}openid{{/code}} scope as described in the [[OIDC spec>>https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest]]. CloudAuth currently defines the following scopes and what they provide:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. scope - {{code}}openid{{/code}}\\r\\n1*. AAA Identity ID\\r\\n1*. IAM Role\\r\\n1. scope - {{code}}https://cloudauth.a2z.com/scopes/aaa#identityInfo{{/code}}\\r\\n1*. [[All AAA identity information>>https://code.amazon.com/packages/CloudAuthCore/blobs/dbdd66dfe8e853798604acafef6c7d333eb775b0/--/src/main/java/com/amazon/cloudauth/util/OIDCConstants.java#L45]]\\r\\n\\r\\nBear in mind for scopes other than {{code}}openid{{/code}}, CloudAuth must make remote calls to other services (like AAA) and will have an impact on latency.\\r\\n\\r\\n== Operations ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What is the expected maintenance effort (patching/updates/migrations) after onboarding CloudAuth? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nPatching and updates are handled through standard CI/CD. And of course if there are any issues, we provide full Tier-1 support, the same level as AAA provides the support.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== I'm getting error messages from CloudAuth, what do they mean? ===\\r\\n\\r\\n[[See this answer>>.||anchor=\\\"H== Is there help for CloudAuth error messages? ===\\\"]]\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What is guidance for peak periods like Prime Day? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nThat will not change no matter you use AAA or CloudAuth, meaning if you are not a peak-sensitive team now, you will remain the same after onboarding with CloudAuth.\\r\\n\\r\\n==== Retail Restricted/Blocked Days and CloudAuth ====\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth is a Tier-1 service, subject to Retail restricted days like Prime Day. During restricted periods, we do not make discretionary deployments.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Customer Impact**\\r\\n\\r\\nThis has impact for you **only** if you are:\\r\\n\\r\\n* **Deploying** to public AWS\\r\\n* **AND** do **not** have an **existing AWS account allowlisted** to create PrivateLinks to the CloudAuth VPC\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you deploy in MAWS, you can work toward or meet your S-Team goal of enabling AWS accessibility for your service without impact. You can use {{code}}catvet{{/code}} or Coral Diver to verify your service's ability to use CloudAuth as an AuthZ protocol for your service.\\r\\nAAA relationship request will continue to be approved. \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Prime Day 2019 period, Allegiance will be suspending the creation of new PrivateLinks as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n==== When will my PrivateLink Allowlisting request be processed? ====\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivateLink allowlisting is automated and normally completes within 5 minutes. (Allow-listing was automated in May 2020).\\r\\n\\r\\n==== Exception Requests for Critical Business Cases ====\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have a **critical **business case for Prime Day 2019 please create a [[SIM using our template>>https://sim.amazon.com/issues/create?template=b9be7be3-3ecb-4a2b-942b-01499585d497]]. Note that you will //also //have to get an exception from the Allegiance Team to create the PrivateLink. See [[their FAQ for Prime Day 2019>>Allegiance.PD2019]] for more details.\\r\\n\\r\\n==== I need to test or develop in public AWS and these restrictions impact my schedule ====\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some suggested workarounds for developing a public AWS solution from within Corp. This will allow you to make some progress if you haven't submitted your allowlisting PrivateLink request before the team's final provisioning day before the restricted period begins.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that you can develop and test normally from the Corp and Prod networks using CloudAuth as there is an existing PrivateLink you use transparently, and AAA relationships can still be registered.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are developing a Lambda, consider using SAM - [[Internal link>>https://w.amazon.com/index.php/SAMToolkit]] / [[External link>>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html]].\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the restricted dates have completed, all outstanding requests will be processed.\\r\\n\\r\\n== Region Support ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Does CloudAuth support cross-region and/or external network calls? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes to both with //a few caveats//. See this [[Sage question>>https://sage.amazon.com/questions/419772]] for the latest.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Do I need to call the AuthServer to which the resource server is talking to (assuming the resource server is in a different region)? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. You should always talk to your local/preferred AuthServer. Tokens issued from CloudAuth/IAD can be recognized by CloudAuth/DUB when introspected and vice versa. It's an anti-pattern to setup different CloudAuth clients talking to different CloudAuth regions.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== How do I know which CloudAuth server I am talking to? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nIf your service runs in MAWS, its requests to CloudAuth will be routed based on latency, as AAA-TLS certificates are recognized and accepted by all Auth servers.\\r\\nIf your service runs in PAWS, its requests to CloudAuth will be routed based on the region in which your IAM role was signed. For example,\\r\\n(% class=\\\"inline-code\\\" %)CloudAuthCredentials credentials = new CloudAuthCredentials.RegionalAwsCredentials(credentialsProvider,'us-east-1');\\r\\n\\r\\nRequests using these credentials will be routed to us-east-1 (IAD).\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What regions are supported by CloudAuth? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth is deployed in the following regions:\\r\\n\\r\\n{{transclude name=\\\"space:Dev\\\\.CDO.UnifiedAuth.CloudAuth.Onboarding.Endpoints\\\"/}}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is the [[tracking SIM>>https://issues.amazon.com/issues/CloudAuth-721]] for additional regions.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== CloudAuth isn't in the region I'm in, what are my options? ===\\r\\n\\r\\n==== CloudAuth Network Connectivity ====\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a complete list of cross region/fabric connectivity options, see the [[BubbleBridge Regions wiki>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BubbleBridge/Regions/]].\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth can be used from a region without a local Auth Server. CloudAuth tokens are can be fetched and used in any region if you can establish network connectivity to the Auth Server. [[BubbleBridge>>https://w.amazon.com/index.php/BubbleBridge]] solves this problems for teams in Public AWS and in their own VPCs. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you're using IAM credentials you'll need to ensure that your application assumes a role in the same AWS region as the CloudAuth installation your using. \\r\\n\\r\\n----\\r\\n\\r\\nThe options below are \\\"replacements\\\" for CloudAuth and not a way to reach CloudAuth from a different region. If you are already on-boarded onto CloudAuth, we suggest using BubbleBridge as mentioned above. If you are still deciding on which Authentication/Authorization provider to use, please also read our [[FAQ/Alternatives to CloudAuth>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/FAQ/#HAlternativestoCloudAuth]] to learn more about trade-offs of using or not using CloudAuth.\\r\\n\\r\\n==== IAM Auth ====\\r\\n\\r\\nServices can also use IAM Auth. This will require using an Api Gateway and manually adding and maintaining identities and permissions via IAM policies.\\r\\n\\r\\n==== Cognito ====\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly if your service accepts calls from humans AWS Cognito is available. As with IAM Auth it requires manual maintenance of permissions via IAM policies.\\r\\n\\r\\n==== Midway ====\\r\\n\\r\\nMidway offers authentication for employees and other humans within the Amazon ecosystem. A service can require midway credentials for authentication and create/maintain its own authorization data/allow-list.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can CloudAuth be used in China regions? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes. CloudAuth China region (cn-north-1) is available now.\\r\\nPlease refer to this wiki to start onboarding: https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/Onboarding/CloudAuthCN/\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What can be used for authorization in China? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nFor connectivity within the China regions IAM Auth is currently the option. AAA-TLS is not supported in China region.\\r\\nPlease follow this wiki for details: https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/Onboarding/CloudAuthCN/\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What rules are there for making cross-region calls between China and other regions? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth will follow the same advice and rules that [[AAA currently uses>>AAA.Guide.Onboarding.Service.Gotchas||anchor=\\\"Security_Regions\\\"]] for cross-region calls to or from China.\\r\\n\\r\\nCN has special rules governing cross-region traffic and how data is handled. By default, AAA will fail calls between CN and another region. If you need to communicate between CN and other regions, you need to get a cross region exception. Please let us know if this is an issue for you so that we may discuss it further. [[Exceptions can be requested.>>AAA.UsersGuide.CrossRegionCalling.]]\\r\\n\\r\\n== Security ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can I use CloudAuth over HTTP? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, all CloudAuth communications must be over TLS end-to-end. See [[Onboarding TLS>>Dev\\\\.CDO.UnifiedAuth.CloudAuth.Onboarding.Prerequisites||anchor=\\\"#HSetUpEnd-to-EndTLSforYourServices\\\"]] for more details.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What does CloudAuth mean by \\\"TLS end-to-end\\\"? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nAll CloudAuth communications must flow over TLS; all network hops between client and resource server and CloudAuth must flow over TLS. An unbroken channel is fine, terminating and reopening (e.g. at a load balancer) is fine provided \\\"all network hops flow over TLS\\\" remains true.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Why does CloudAuth require TLS end-to-end? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth-issued credentials must be kept confidential in transit to protect against man in the middle attacks, replay attacks, and other vulnerabilities. TLS end-to-end, TLS over every network hop, provides the required transport-level protection.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== How does CloudAuth's TLS end-to-end requirement map to InfoSec guidance? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong InfoSec's 3 recommended TLS termination options at time of writing, only 1 ([[on-host termination>>https://skb.highcastle.a2z.com/guides/128#TcH9CAQDx9c]]) and 3 ([[TLS termination at VPC Edge, with TLS resumed to back-end host>>https://skb.highcastle.a2z.com/guides/128#TcH9CAqHG29]]) satisfy CloudAuth's end-to-end TLS requirement, with 1 being strongly preferred. 2 ([[TLS termination at VPC edge, clear text to back-end host>>https://skb.highcastle.a2z.com/guides/128#TcH9CAi59Gz]]) is not OK.\\r\\n\\r\\n2 fails \\\"all network hops are over TLS\\\" as everything within the VPC is sent in the clear. Though InfoSec accepts 2 combined with compensating controls (e.g. security group), CloudAuth currently has no means to validate whether any of those compensating controls are present/enforced, much less whether they sufficiently protect credentials flowing throughout the VPC. We'd need to verify full network setup, VPC actors, etc. but are still working on a list of gaps: raw permissions/visibility, APIs from Conduit/BuilderTools/Service Intelligence/AWS to help ourselves, clear definitions from InfoSec for what is/isn't acceptable. As a result, we can't allow 2 at this time.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Has CloudAuth been certified by InfoSec? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, CloudAuth is fully certified and endorsed by InfoSec. [[CloudAuth in Anvil>>https://anvil.amazon.com/applications/70502]]\\r\\n\\r\\n=== How is this different from AAA-Symmetric? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nAAA-Symmetric is available in Prod/Corp and only supports EC2 AWS types in Public AWS ([[Nebula roadmap>>Nebula.Roadmap.]]). ECS and Lambda are not supported by AAA-Symmetric. CloudAuth is a new service in Public AWS (or spanning different environments) to authenticate and authorize calls between services. CloudAuth does not require a daemon or a thick client side library nor the lengthy bootstrap process.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some important differences between AAA-Symmetric and CloudAuth that you'll need to be aware of:\\r\\n\\r\\n* While AAA-Symmetric encrypts the payload and communicates over HTTP, CloudAuth tokens are placed in the HTTP ##Authorization## header, so all CloudAuth communication must occur over TLS (HTTPS) ([[CloudAuth onboarding>>Dev\\\\.CDO.UnifiedAuth.CloudAuth.Onboarding.]])\\r\\n* CloudAuth doesn't have any concept of passthrough mode\\r\\n* CloudAuth currently doesn't support the [[Additional Information>>AAA.AdditionalInformation.]] that exists in the runtime client (we're looking into adding it in the future)\\r\\n* No support for airgapped regions (e.g. DCA, LCK)\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can I log an access token? client identity assertion? identity token? ===\\r\\n\\r\\n(% class=\\\"box errormessage\\\" %)\\r\\n(((\\r\\nNo.\\r\\nCredentials issued by CloudAuth are bearer credentials, anyone in possession of these credentials can use them to gain access or impersonate a valid client.\\r\\n)))\\r\\n\\r\\nCredentials issued by CloudAuth should **never** be logged in full. Based on the data handling standard introspection responses can be logged to clarify the claims present in a token, but the signature must never be logged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=== If token validity is 12 hours, why should I refresh tokens before they expire? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nClients using their tokens up to their expiry time introduces latency and availability risks. Fortunately the CloudAuthStandardJava client [[handles refreshing tokens in advance of their expiry>>https://code.amazon.com/packages/CloudAuthStandardJavaClient/blobs/54d051d4714431bbed2869aee5b752f4b025f912/--/src/main/java/com/amazon/cloudauth/client/CloudAuthCache.java#L320-L371,L130,L131,L132]] (currently at 90%) of their lifetime.\\r\\n\\r\\nClients may see latency or call failures if they make calls to a resource server with a token at it's expiry time. If the client presents an expired token the resource server will reject the call with a challenge. The client call will either fail or will need to fetch a new token in band and retry the call to get the resource requested. Fetching a token in band and retrying the call will increase latency by the cost of the two additional calls.\\r\\n\\r\\nRefreshing a token in advance of its expiry also improves availability for clients and services. In the case of a CloudAuth outage clients and services can continue to communicate using previously fetched tokens up to the token's expiry. Re-fetching a token before it expires gives the client a buffer of active time to fetch a new token should a call to re-fetch a token fail.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Why do introspection results need to be refreshed every 15 minutes? ===\\r\\n\\r\\n(% class=\\\"box warningmessage\\\" %)\\r\\n(((\\r\\nIntrospection results on the resource server need to be refreshed ever 15 minutes, tokens use by the clients should be refetched at 80%-90% of their lifetime.\\r\\n)))\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 12 hour lifetime of a token is a balance between availability and security. For the lifetime of a token a client and resource server can communicate successfully without contacting the Auth Server, removing the Auth Server from that communication also removes the Auth Server as an availability risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what if a token is exposed to an unintended party? The nature of bearer credentials means that the unintended party would be able to spoof the client for the life of the token.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo limit the potential for data leaks resource servers should periodically verify that an access token is still valid for use. At present the guidance is to verify this every 15 minutes by making a remote introspection call to the Auth Server. This allows the Auth Server to revoke the access granted by a specific access token forcing the client to fetch a new token. To maintain availability the existing introspection result should be used in the case of remote introspection failure.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== If I remove an operation from an relationship, how long it will take before the clients got rejected? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 15 minutes and 24 hours, due to various propagation delays in the underlying storage (S3 and Dynamo DB) and caches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=== If I remove an identity from a application, how long it will take before the clients got rejected? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 15 minutes and 24 hours, due to various propagation delays in the underlying storage (S3 and Dynamo DB) and caches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== HTTP/S and TLS ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can I use a self-signed certificate ===\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. The standard CloudAuthJava Client and Resource server components will error if you try and use a self signed certificate.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== I'm getting a self-signed certificate error, but I am using a Redfort certificate ===\\r\\n\\r\\nCoral will fail through to a self-signed certificate if it can't find a keystore or trust store at activation-time.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== How can I determine if I am using a self-signed certificate? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nLook for Issuer=Subject in the certificate. [[An answer can be found in Sage 670257>>https://sage.amazon.com/posts/670257]].\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can I use JLBRelay with CloudAuth ===\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of this moment [June 25, 2019], JLBRelay isn't compatible with the CloudAuth resource server components.

CloudAuth allows clients to securely request resources from services across the Prod/Corp and Public AWS fabrics.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Why would I use CloudAuth? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nIf clients and services are running in different environments (Prod/Corp, Public AWS) or both client and services are in Public AWS and you need Authentication and Authorization support then CloudAuth is for you.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== When will CloudAuth be available in Public AWS/Prod/Corp? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth was released for General Availability on 2018-03-30 including support for Highly Confidential and Critical data services. To track continuing improvements support for new frameworks and new environments check the[[ UnifiedAuth Roadmap>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/Roadmap]].\\r\\n\\r\\n== CloudAuth Fundamentals ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What is a //resource server//? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nThe service hosting the protected resources, capable of and responding to resource requests from clients using access tokens.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What is the CloudAuth //auth server//? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nThe server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating all parties involved and obtaining authorization from AAA relationship data.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== How does CloudAuth work? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth follows the [[OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant flow>>https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4]].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic flow is as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The Client requests credentials for a specific resource, presenting it's credentials to the Auth Server\\r\\n1. The Auth Server authenticates the Client, determines permissions, and if they are granted issues the Client credentials in the form of a token\\r\\n1. The Client requests a resource from the Resource Server, presenting the token provided by the Auth Server\\r\\n1. The Resource Server requests that the Auth Server introspect the token, providing information about the validity of the token\\r\\n1. The Auth Server provides information about the token's validity, and the permissions it grants\\r\\n1. The Resource Server determines if the Client is authorized, and if so provides the resource\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce a Client has received a token, the token should be cached so the Client can continue to use the token for access until the token expires, or is rejected by the Resource Server. In the same way the Resource Server can cache the introspection response for a token, allowing the Resource Server to make authorization decisions when that token is presented again. This reduces the standard resource access flow to:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The Client requests resource, providing a token that grants access from it's cache\\r\\n1. The Resource Server makes an authorization decision based on cached introspection information, and provides the resource if the Client is authorized\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Does CloudAuth use standard OAuth2? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes.\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth passes some additional parameters as is allowed by the spec. These extra parameters have been written into a spec currently [[working towards approval by the OAuth 2.0 Working Group>>https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hardt-oauth-distributed-00]].\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What network fabrics does CloudAuth work in? Can I connect from Prod to Prod? Public AWS to public AWS? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth supports connectivity between any Amazon network fabrics.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Resource Server that accepts CloudAuth traffic can accept requests from //any CloudAuth client that can establish network connectivity// and meet two requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\n1. The request must be sent over a secure connection [[from end to end>>https://skb.highcastle.a2z.com/guides/128]]\\r\\n1. The client must have a valid AAA relationship for that connection (with appropriate cross security domain and [[cross region considerations>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AAA/Guide/Manage/Client/Request_Cross_Region_Exception]])\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes this mean CORP to PROD is supported? Yes\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes this mean PROD to public AWS is supported? Yes\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes this mean ~_~_~_~_~_~_~_~_ to ~_~_~_~_~_~_~_~_ is supported? Yes\\r\\n\\r\\n=== How do cross region calls work in CloudAuth? Do the client and resource server need to call CloudAuth in the same region? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth fully supports cross region calls. \\r\\n\\r\\nClients and resource servers do not need to call CloudAuth in the same region to make cross region calls. CloudAuth's auth servers recognize and validate CloudAuth tokens created in any region. Clients can request tokens from CloudAuth in one region (say us-west-2) and make calls to a resource server in another region (say us-east-1) who can introspect those tokens at CloudAuth in their local region (us-east-1).\\r\\n\\r\\n{{plantUML}}\\r\\n@startuml\\r\\nautonumber\\r\\ntitle Cross region calls with CloudAuth\\r\\n\\r\\nbox \\\"us-west-2\\\"\\r\\n participant \\\"Client in\\\\nus-west-2\\\\n(example)\\\" as c\\r\\n participant \\\"CloudAuth in\\\\nus-west-2\\\" as caw\\r\\nend box\\r\\nbox \\\"us-east-1\\\"\\r\\n participant \\\"Resource Server in\\\\nus-east-1\\\\n(example)\\\" as rs\\r\\n participant \\\"CloudAuth in\\\\nus-east-1\\\" as cae\\r\\nend box\\r\\n\\r\\nc -> rs: \\\\\\r\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t request <resource>\\r\\nc <- rs: \\\\\\r\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t401 UNAUTHORIZED\\\\n\\\\\\r\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t<CloudAuth challenge>\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\r\\nc -> caw: \\\\\\r\\n/token <CloudAuth challenge>\\r\\nc <- caw: \\\\\\r\\n<access token for resource server>\\r\\nc -> rs: \\\\\\r\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\trequest <resource>\\\\n\\\\\\r\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t<access token for resource server>\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\r\\nrs -> cae: \\\\\\r\\n/introspect\\\\n\\\\\\r\\n<access token for resource server>\\r\\nrs <- cae: \\\\\\r\\n<validated token claims>\\r\\nrs -> rs: \\\\\\r\\nauthorize client\\r\\nc <- rs: \\\\\\r\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t<resource>\\r\\n\\r\\n@enduml\\r\\n{{/plantUML}}\\r\\n\\r\\nCross region calls using CloudAuth are dependent on the permissions set for the resource at the resource server. When using AAA permissions cross region calls are enabled by default for all regions, excluding calls between China and other regions which [[require a cross region exception>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AAA/Guide/Manage/Client/Request_Cross_Region_Exception/]].\\r\\n\\r\\n== Alternatives to CloudAuth ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can I use AWS Auth instead even if I am not an AWS Service? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nAWS Auth is an internal service providing authentication and authorization services for AWS services. It can (and MUST) be used for any public AWS Service and can also be used for internal AWS Services (e.g. for service to service communications between different service components).\\r\\n\\r\\nAWS Auth is usable by teams outside of AWS in a limited capacity. Because AWS Auth is really only available to AWS teams a service wanting to use AWS Auth must use an AWS service like Api Gateway or ALB to perform per request auth. Services going this route [[should re-establish TLS>>https://skb.highcastle.a2z.com/guides/128]] between the load balancer (Api Gateway or ALB) and their backend hosts.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore detail [[here - Can I use AWS Auth if I am not an AWS Service?>>https://w.amazon.com/index.php/AWSAuth/FAQ#Can_I_use_AWS_Auth_if_I_am_not_an_AWS_Service.3F]].\\r\\n\\r\\n=== AWS IAM Service to Service Authentication migration to CloudAuth FAQs ===\\r\\n\\r\\n**~1. My application already use AWS IAM with API Gateway for Service to Service to Authentication, why should I migrate to CloudAuth?**\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth is the approved paved path solution for all Ring 0 and 1 SDO teams as per Security Expectations 3. AWSAuth (through API Gateway and STS) is not approved because of the following security benefits from CloudAuth. Non-Ring 0 and 1 applications are good to use AWSAuth (through API Gateway and STS).\\r\\n\\r\\n* CloudAuth is built on AAA control plane which helps manage relationships to multiple clients\\r\\n* CloudAuth provides differentiated features like integration with transitive auth (TA token propagation) and will provide differentiated features in the future, such as transitive auth token issuance (TA-STS), delegated auth, and pluggable authorization (See Roadmap for more details). These features are not available with SIGv4.\\r\\n* Infosec is building tooling to leverage CloudAuth and AAA logs to increase security across SDO.\\r\\n* Consistency across SDO applications\\r\\n* Integrated with Amazon's frameworks (Coral, ARest, BSF, Horizonte), libraries (Gizmo throttling, metrics)\\r\\n* Highly performant\\r\\n* Supports multiple client authentication types (IAM, AAA TLS, with Midway/Federate coming soon)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Below are some trade-offs to consider while using CloudAuth:**\\r\\n\\r\\n* Latency at startup\\r\\n* Applications with high service call volumes should plan for increased availability requirements and costs due to Lambda invocations from unauthenticated callers that were previously managed by API Gateway (this also applies to other computing options such as ECS).\\r\\n* CloudAuth is in limited regions (see here for a list of current regions supported; see the roadmap for upcoming regions)\\r\\n* Community supported in most languages\\r\\n\\r\\n**Trade-offs of choosing AWS Auth:**\\r\\n\\r\\n* incur the cost of APIGateway (expensive and latent)\\r\\n* incur the additional client cost of signing every transaction\\r\\n* limited to no visibility into authN/authZ errors\\r\\n* no integration support for transitive auth\\r\\n* manually manage changing policies for new clients and existing clients\\r\\n** manage the lifecycle and permissions of the clients and service (who does this account belong to? how do I page them?)\\r\\n** handle the distribution of consumer API keys for throttling as part of onboarding\\r\\n** handle the distribution of policy API keys that are used as ‘roles’ as part of onboarding\\r\\n** handle the tracking/rotation/revocation of the above keys or build a self-service UI that wraps AWS to do this on your behalf, in which case, you now build and manage your own mini-AAA\\r\\n* go through a security review, this is highly confidential data when in bulk\\r\\n* create the audit logs and provide them to InfoSec if required\\r\\n* create the logging and metrics for the above\\r\\n\\r\\n**2. Does migrating from AWS IAM to CloudAuth increase DDoS risks?**\\r\\n\\r\\nThis migration approach does not introduce additional DDoS risks, as confirmed by CloudAuth through validation with API Gateway and Lambda service teams.\\r\\n\\r\\n==== Other Benefits of CloudAuth ====\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Enable fine grained access control (FGAC). TransitiveAuth (TA) adoption is critical to enable FGAC across SDO data custodian services. By EOY 2025, we will have TA coverage across all existing CloudAuth services, however there is still a large gap (~~20k) of services remaining across SDO that are not in the CloudAuth \\\"fabric\\\" and therefore not on TransitiveAuth. This poses a Security / FGAC risk as requests originating from these non-CloudAuth services are not initiating TA tokens, therefore the TA token that is eventually generated downstream does not contain the \\\"true initiator identity\\\" for the data custodians / data stewards to base their FGAC policy decision upon. Driving CA adoption across all remaining services in 2026 will ensure the \\\"true initiator\\\" services are initiating the TA tokens. The CloudAuth team is also investing in FGAC pre-compute capabilities to further simplify FGAC onboarding and enforcement. UnifiedAuth plans to precompute certain fine-grained access control (FGAC) permissions for a given call graph with specified mission and context. Precomputed permission will be minted in TA tokens which will reduce call chain failures at data custodians and surface issues at initiator level.\\r\\n1. **Region Flex (RFE) Enablement: **\\r\\n\\\\\\\\2.1) Region-flexibility for NAWS services: NAWS API gateway services use sigv4 for IAM auth. Sigv4 include a single region in the signing, which means a request signed for a region can only process in that region. This breaks RFE initiatives such as LRA which are removing dependency on specific region. RFE’s preferred and long-term approach is using CloudAuth for NAWS services [while we are looking at short-term workarounds such as sigv4a].\\r\\n\\\\\\\\2.2) SDO service graph: RFE’s rub-experience and region migration guidance relies on discovery dependencies. Today we have limited coverage, especially on NAWS. CloudAuth everywhere combined with CloudAuth usage metrics and Axon integration increases the coverage.\\r\\n\\\\\\\\2.3) Resource relationship and discovery: For resource discovery RFE starts with pipelines and “infers” relationships and resources. The inference introduces inaccuracies. For example, to identify a service’s FQDN, the current path is pipeline → [infer AAA application] → Endpoints. With CloudAuth everywhere, we can use AAA IDs as the starting point removing the inference step.\\r\\n\\\\\\\\2.4) Runtime “who am I” across SDO: For use-case such as traffic shifting, customers are asking for a context that allows them to move traffic from certain callers before others.\\r\\n\\\\\\\\2.5) Less variety: With initiative like RFE one of the major challenges is the variety across SDO. We often are forced to provide accelerators and solutions that have limited coverage. Using CloudAuth everywhere for service↔service AuthNZ allows us to reach more with doing less. For example, LRA and TSA’s are not available for endpoints that are not registered with UnifiedAuth.\\r\\n1. Improve SDO business outcomes leveraging Agentic AI: The Applied AI group is working with UnifiedAuth (owners of CloudAuth CA & TransitiveAuth TA) as the AuthN and AuthZ service to secure interactions between AI agent applications and Amazon internal webtools (e.g., Harmony, Purchase Order Portal, etc.). CA & TA will validate service-to-service communications, ensuring only authorized AI agents can access protected resources. While existing midway support for human AuthN and AuthZ will remain unchanged, our mental model conceptualizes AI Agent access to WebTools as service to service interactions, distinct from human-to-service interactions. A critical component of this architecture is TA token support across SDO and AWS, which enables agentic AI identity & security context propagation across SDO & AWS call graphs - essential for auditing and fine-grained access control decisions. As SDO evolves to incorporate Agentic AI, where AI bots act on behalf of employees or customers across browsers and web portals, the security context propagation requirements become more complex. Beyond traditional actor identity and attributes, it becomes crucial to propagate and maintain context about both the AI bot and the principal (human) on whose behalf it's acting. This dual-context propagation is essential for data custodians to perform fine-grained authorization decisions and maintain comprehensive audit trails. When investigating data access patterns or security incidents, organizations must be able to distinguish whether actions were initiated directly by humans or by AI agents. This requirement adds a new dimension to the existing TA token structure, potentially necessitating additional context attributes to capture the AI agent's identity, permissions scope, and delegation chain. Such context becomes particularly critical in scenarios involving sensitive operations or when complying with regulations that may have specific requirements for automated processing of customer data.\\r\\n1. Compliance and Business Opportunity: There are a variety of existing and upcoming regulatory and compliance requirements that require security context propagation (via TransitiveAuth), as well as FGAC enforcement (via UAAL pluggable auth solutions). As noted above, services on CloudAuth get TA & Pluggable AuthN / AuthZ by default, which negates the need for undifferentiated service owner effort to onboard to each of these solutions (e.g. TA, Helis, Bindles) separately. Examples of Regulations Requiring FGAC Enforcement: DMA, Quebec Privacy Law, GDPR, etc. Examples of Certifications Requiring FGAC Enforcement: SOC 2 Type 2 (Supply Chain by Amazon, Santos targeting to achieve this to unblock large enterprise customers).\\r\\n1. UnifiedAuth Abstraction Layer (UAAL): UAAL is an abstraction layer provided by CloudAuth. It provides a standardized set of interfaces for interacting with SDO's auth landscape for Access Control. UAAL allows for service owners across SDO to make and enforce authorization decisions at runtime. With UAAL, CloudAuth acts as an orchestrator across SDOs identity, context and policy providers. UAAL allows SDO service owners to apply Company, Organization and Team wide Access Control policies. Policies are prioritized, Company > Organization > Time wide Access Control policies. UAAL leverages the “pluggable authN/Z” capabilitiy from UnifiedAuth, abstracting away service owner custom integration with solutions like Midway, Federate, Helis, Bindles, etc.\\r\\n1. Automated Audit Trail: CloudAuth has integrated with SEL, enabling 0 effort SEL onboarding for any service on CloudAuth.\\r\\n1. Prod / Non Prod: CloudAuth-based solution that allows security teams to build detection of unapproved calls from non-production environments to production services. We will then extend CloudAuth’s service-to-service policy definition and enforcement mechanisms to allow service owners to prevent calls to production services from non-production environments unless explicitly approved via policy exceptions (and vice versa).\\r\\n1. Axon integration w/ CloudAuth - planning on building this in 2025.Observability: CloudAuth's strategic position in the infrastructure provides unique opportunities for comprehensive observability. Being present at every service-to-service intersection and serving 35K services (growing 25% YoY), CloudAuth can collect and process an impressive 1 billion data points every 5 minutes. This massive data collection, combined with AI-powered analytics, can transform raw telemetry into actionable insights, enabling real-time monitoring, automated root cause analysis, streamlined compliance reporting, and detailed usage pattern tracking. This improved observability creates a powerful flywheel effect: better telemetry leads to richer insights, enabling more automation, which reduces builder effort and encourages broader adoption, ultimately generating even more comprehensive telemetry data.\\r\\n1. CloudAuth enables per-client throttling\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Is AWSAuth a valid alternative (to CloudAuth)? ===\\r\\n\\r\\n[[CloudAuth is recommended solution for SDO teams>>https://skb.highcastle.a2z.com/recommendations/22]], however AWSAuth is a valid alternative (through API Gateway and STS).

CloudAuth is still authentication and authorization. Unlike AAA,-Symmetric/AAA-TLS it is based on the public OAuth 2.0 standard, as well as TLS.\\r\\nImplementation-wise, CloudAuth uses AAA relationships. Client identities are all specified within AAA, so when a client (resource servers are still clients of CloudAuth) assert (prove) their identities, it is mapped to a AAA Application. This is either done using AAA-TLS certificates when in the Prod network or IAM role credentials when in Prod/AWS.\\r\\n1. This is beneficial in that it is a well known and audited protocol. There are also publicly-maintained clients that we can take advantage of (with some modification as we also use [[Distributed OAuth>>url:https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hardt-oauth-distributed-00]]).\\r\\n1. It **requires** TLS end-to-end support. Without TLS E-E, you are not allowed to use CloudAuth (that is, all resource servers and auth servers **must** deny access if the connection isn't secure). AAA-Symmetric only encrypts the payload, not the headers.—The reason is historical; Netscalar load balancers actually proxy connections, so load balancers can see the contents of any SSL VIP connection; so encrypting the payload separately makes AAA-Symmetric connections secure from load balancers.—But OAuth passes credentials (tokens) through headers. Possessing a token is all a client needs to prove they can do something, which means the entire connection must be encrypted/decrypted only on the endpoints\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Is there a diagram of how and where AAA and CloudAuth can be used? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nThis diagram attempts to capture the interactions between services, across public AWS and PROD/CORP (MAWS).\\r\\n\\r\\n{{plantUML}}\\r\\n@startuml\\r\\nskinparam ParticipantPadding 20\\r\\nskinparam BoxPadding 50\\r\\n\\r\\ntitle Auth Interactions Between Services and Environments\\r\\n\\r\\nbox \\\"Your VPC in public AWS\\\" #FF9900\\r\\nparticipant \\\"Service on EC2 protecting\\\\nendpoint with CloudAuth\\\" as NAWS << (N,#ADD1B2) >>\\r\\nend box\\r\\n\\r\\nbox \\\"MAWS\\\" #76eacc\\r\\nparticipant \\\"Service protecting\\\\nendpoint with CloudAuth\\\" as ProdCa << (C,#ADD1B2) >>\\r\\nparticipant \\\"Service protecting\\\\nendpoint with AAA\\\" as ProdAAA << (A,#ADD1B2) >>\\r\\nparticipant \\\"Service protecting endpoint\\\\nwith CloudAuth AND AAA\\\" as ProdCaAAA << (B,#ADD1B2) >>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nend box\\r\\n\\r\\nautonumber\\r\\n\\r\\ngroup Successful Call Patterns\\r\\n\\r\\n    group Between Prod/Corp and public AWS: CloudAuth\\r\\n        NAWS <-> ProdCa : Call using CloudAuth\\r\\n        NAWS <-> ProdCaAAA : Call using CloudAuth\\r\\n        ProdAAA -> NAWS : Call using CloudAuth\\r\\n    end\\r\\n\\r\\n    group Calling within Prod/Corp: CloudAuth or AAA \\r\\n        ProdCa <-> ProdCaAAA : Call using CloudAuth\\r\\n        ProdAAA -> ProdCa : Call using CloudAuth\\r\\n        ProdAAA -> ProdCaAAA : Call using CloudAuth\\r\\n        ProdCaAAA <-> ProdAAA : Call using AAA\\r\\n        ProdCa -> ProdAAA : Call using AAA\\r\\n    end\\r\\n    \\r\\n    group Between Prod/Corp and public AWS: Using AAA\\r\\n     NAWS -> ProdAAA : Call using AAA\\r\\n  NAWS -> ProdCaAAA : Call using AAA\\r\\n    end\\r\\nend\\r\\n\\r\\ngroup Unsuccessful Call Patterns\\r\\n group Between Prod/Corp and public AWS: Using AAA\\r\\n        NAWS ->X ProdCa : Call using AAA\\r\\n        ProdCaAAA ->X NAWS : Call using AAA\\r\\n        ProdAAA ->x NAWS : Call using AAA\\r\\n        ProdCa ->X NAWS : Call using AAA\\r\\n         end\\r\\n group Between Prod/Corp and public AWS: No CloudAuth Support in Prod Service\\r\\n  NAWS ->x ProdAAA : Call using CloudAuth\\r\\n end\\r\\n    group Within Prod/Corp: CloudAuth to a AAA-only service\\r\\n  ProdAAA X<- ProdCaAAA : Call using CloudAuth\\r\\n        ProdCa ->X ProdAAA: Call using CloudAuth\\r\\n end\\r\\n\\r\\nend\\r\\n@enduml\\r\\n{{/plantUML}}\\r\\n\\r\\n=== If I run CloudAuth do I need to run the AAASecurityDaemon? AAARuntimeJavaClient? AAARoadsideAssist? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nNo.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a protocol level CloudAuth and AAA-Symmetric/AAA-TLS are completely independent. A service that only supports CloudAuth doesn't need to run the AAASecurityDaemon daemon or take any code dependencies AAA-Symmetric/AAA-TLS libraries.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmazon services and their clients may authenticate using one of two methods, [[SigV4 signature generated using IAM Role credentials>>Coral.Manual.CloudAuth||anchor=\\\"HCodetosetupyourCloudAuthcredentials\\\"]] or [[AAA mutual TLS>>Coral.Manual.CloudAuth||anchor=\\\"HCreatewithAAA-TLS\\\"]].\\r\\n\\r\\nFor clients running in public AWS, especially in dynamic runtimes like ECS or Lambda, IAM Role credentials are recommended.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor clients running MAWS either authentication method can be used, IAM credentials are probably easiest unless your service already has AAA TLS credentials (i.e. is running the AAA Security Daemon).\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can I support AAA-Symmetric/AAA-TLS and CloudAuth traffic on the same service? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes. This is well supported in Coral, ARest, and BSF.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe service will need a TLS endpoint, on host if it's in PROD, to support CloudAuth traffic.\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth and AAA-Symmetric/AAA-TLS should be run as independent authorizers, each rendering their own authorization decision. \\r\\n\\r\\nExample implementation can be found here: [[https:~~/~~/code.amazon.com/packages/HowToUseCloudAuthWithCoral/blobs/2530dc083ddea30046a76b897dfc554620cf3ace/~~-~~-/src/com/amazon/HowToUseCloudAuthWithCoral/modules/CloudAuthWithAAAModule.java#L19>>url:https://code.amazon.com/packages/HowToUseCloudAuthWithCoral/blobs/2530dc083ddea30046a76b897dfc554620cf3ace/--/src/com/amazon/HowToUseCloudAuthWithCoral/modules/CloudAuthWithAAAModule.java#L19]]\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can I use CloudAuth to call an AAA-Symmetric/AAA-TLS protected service? Can I use AAA-Symmetric/AAA-TLS to call a CloudAuth protected service? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. \\r\\n\\r\\nAAA-Symmetric/AAA-TLS and CloudAuth are independent protocols, so credentials from one protocol cannot be used to access resources from another.\\r\\n\\r\\nA resource (service) can be protected with both protocols, accepting calls from clients using either.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can a service protected by AAA-Symmetric/AAA-TLS make calls to a service protected by CloudAuth? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe AAA service will be acting as a client of the CloudAuth protected service, so the AAA protected service will have to create CloudAuth credentials for authenticating. the AAA service won't need to complete CloudAuth onboarding as a resource server, but will need to complete the [[client onboarding>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/Onboarding/OnboardingClients]]. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe authorization system/protocol a service uses to protect its resources is independent of the authorization it uses to make calls, as a client, to other services. CloudAuth protected services can make calls to services protected by AAA, and AAA protected services can make calls to services protected by CloudAuth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe protocols are independent and cover a single link in the graph.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Does CloudAuth support AAA-Symmetric passthrough mode? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CloudAuth protocol doesn't support an idea of Passthrough mode, but does work with services using AAA-Symmetric for Passthrough mode.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to a bug in the Authorization handler used by our frameworks unauthenticated requests to a service protected with CloudAuth and AAA with operations in Passthrough Mode will be rejected with a 401 http status code. As a result, existing clients not making AAA enabled requests will be rejected. The fix for this bug [[is on a branch>>https://code.amazon.com/packages/CoralAAAAuthorizer/logs/heads/passthrough]] and will be pushed to live once better tested. \\r\\n\\r\\n(% style=\\\"font-size:16px\\\" %)**Disclaimer**\\r\\n\\r\\nOperations in AAA Passthrough Mode approve all requests. In Coral and ARest an approve from any authorizer in the chain is treated as authoritative. This means the AAA Authorizer's decision to approve requests to passthrough operations supersedes any other decision, approving the request. Clients attempting to use CloudAuth will be approved, as will existing clients using AAA, as will any calling client. \\r\\n\\r\\nPassthrough was created for services adopting AAA as a way to allow them to onboard clients without interrupting service. Once all clients were AAA enabled a service was supposed to migrate to enforcement mode. The persistence of passthrough mode indicates that this approach wasn't successful. CloudAuth chose not to recreate it.\\r\\n\\r\\n(% style=\\\"font-size:16px\\\" %)**Coral 1.1**\\r\\n\\r\\nCoral 1.1 has a branch to support services protected with CloudAuth and AAA with operations in Passthrough Mode. To use this branch, build the \\\"passthrough\\\" branch into your version set. \\r\\n\\r\\n[[https:~~/~~/code.amazon.com/packages/CoralAAAAuthorizer/logs/heads/passthrough>>url:https://code.amazon.com/packages/CoralAAAAuthorizer/logs/heads/passthrough]]\\r\\n\\r\\n(% style=\\\"font-size:16px\\\" %)**ARest**\\r\\n\\r\\nARest support is currently being designed. \\r\\n\\r\\n(% style=\\\"font-size:16px\\\" %)**BSF C++**\\r\\n\\r\\nBSF C++ officially supports services protected with CloudAuth and AAA with operations in Passthrough Mode.\\r\\n\\r\\n(% style=\\\"font-size:16px\\\" %)**BSF Java**\\r\\n\\r\\nSee [[BSF allow listing>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BSF/CloudAuth/#Hallowlisting]]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can CloudAuth and AAA-Symmetric be used together in the same service? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, assuming your service is already using AAA-Symmetric (if not see our question on supporting AAA-Symmetric in new services).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a service receives a request that's been signed and encrypted with AAA-Symmetric, it verifies authorization using the AAA Security Daemon. When a request is received over HTTPS that includes a CloudAuth token, it is verified using the CloudAuth //auth server//. When a request is received over HTTPS that does not include a CloudAuth token, the response is a CloudAuth challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== After my service onboards with CloudAuth, can I drop AAA-Symmetric protocol support? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYour current clients authenticate to your services using AAA and they will continue to do so unless they migrate to CloudAuth. As long as you have heterogeneous client base, you should continue to support AAA (for existing clients) and CloudAuth (for new clients) in parallel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you 'drop' AAA-Symmetric protocol support, you no longer allow clients to use AAA-signed requests to access your service. Any clients that have continued to use AAA will retrieve either 403 errors (if using HTTP) or 401 errors with a challenge (if using HTTPS).\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce all of your AAA clients onboard with CloudAuth and authenticate with your service using CloudAuth, you may drop AAA protocol support.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be clear, AAA is still always used as the source of authentication and authorization information, which is used by CloudAuth. So you still need to create a AAA application and a AAA service.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== My service is already using AAA-Symmetric but needs to call a CloudAuth protected service. Do I need to onboard as a CloudAuth client? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, you'll need to onboard your service to CloudAuth as a client to access the CloudAuth protected service. \\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth and AAA-Symmetric communicate authentication information and make authorization decisions in [[very different ways>>Dev.CDO.UnifiedAuth.CloudAuth.FAQ.WebHome||anchor=\\\"HHowisCloudAuthdifferentfromAAA3F\\\"]]. Due to these differences services must onboard directly with the protocol (either CloudAuth or AAA-Symmetric)they need to use to access a resource.\\r\\n\\r\\n== Adopting CloudAuth ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== I am creating a new service, should I use CloudAuth? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nAbsolutely! CloudAuth is the successor to AAA-Symmetric supporting both AWS and Prod runtimes, and long term strategy for authentication and authorization in Amazon. If you are building a new service, CloudAuth is all you need.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== I am creating a new service, should I also support AAA-Symmetric? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. AAA-Symmetric is being sunset.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What are prerequisites to using CloudAuth? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are only a [[few requirements>>Dev\\\\.CDO.UnifiedAuth.CloudAuth.Onboarding.Prerequisites.]].\\r\\n\\r\\n1. All traffic between the service clients and the resource server must be running over HTTPS.\\r\\n1. Private Links need to be created between the various services and to CloudAuth.\\r\\n1. Service Owners will need to create or update their AAA service profiles with IAM roles.\\r\\n1. Each service client and resource server will also need to be updated to include OAuth code. AREST, Coral and BSF Java and C++ framework upgrades are available.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore details are available in [[CloudAuth Onboarding>>Dev\\\\.CDO.UnifiedAuth.CloudAuth.Onboarding.]].\\r\\n\\r\\n=== If migrating an existing service from Prod/Corp to Public AWS, do AAA relationships need to be recreated? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. You can use your existing AAA relationships. However, CloudAuth introduces OAuth scopes which can greatly simplify the creation and maintenance of AAA Relationships. There are additional steps to onboard with CloudAuth. See [[CloudAuth Onboarding>>Dev\\\\.CDO.UnifiedAuth.CloudAuth.Onboarding.]].\\r\\n\\r\\n=== For a AAA-enabled service in Prod/Corp, what must be done for clients to call it from Public AWS? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a few options to allow clients to call your Prod service from Public AWS.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf your clients are using EC2 runtimes, you can simply create an Allegiance/PrivateLink endpoint that your clients can call and register your IAM roles with the AAA UI. This will allow your clients (using EC2) to call your Prod-based service using AAA-Symmetric. See [[C2S service auth for Public AWS>>C2S.NativeAWSServiceAuth.]] for more.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf your clients are using other AWS runtimes, Lambda/ECS, then you will need to onboard your service to CloudAuth. See [[detailed onboarding steps>>Dev\\\\.CDO.UnifiedAuth.CloudAuth.Onboarding.]].\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Which operations should I request access to in the AAA dashboard? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a client, you need to request the **getToken** operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a resource server, you need to request the **getToken**, **bootstrap**, and **introspect** operations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above operations requests are automatically approved for all applications and generally don't require any justification. If you request other operations than the above, your request will be delayed until someone has a chance to approve this request. If your application needs access to some of the lesser used features of CloudAuth, please include a justification message for these.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Do I need an AAA relationship if I'm using AWSAuth? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, you don't need an AAA relationship if the resource is protected by AWSAuth. AWSAuth and CloudAuth are different protocols, AAA relationships only apply to CloudAuth/AAA protected traffic.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Why is my AAA relationship request delayed? ===\\r\\n\\r\\n{{transclude name=\\\"space:Dev\\\\.CDO.UnifiedAuth.CloudAuth.Onboarding.PauseMessage.AAARelationship\\\"/}}\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to reduce the amount of time spent authorizing access requests for every application at Amazon, AAA automatically approves the **getToken**, **bootstrap**, and **introspect** operations. If any other operations are requested then this delays the approval. Unless you know that you need operations not in the above list, please cancel the request and resubmit your request.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Why do I see a \\\"You are not done!\\\" banner on the AAA dashboard? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a bug in AAA, please follow [[https:~~/~~/issues.amazon.com/issues/AAABACKLOG-1809?title=AAAFrontendWebsite-You-are-not-done!-banner-remains-after-CloudAuth-Onboarding>>url:https://issues.amazon.com/issues/AAABACKLOG-1809?title=AAAFrontendWebsite-You-are-not-done!-banner-remains-after-CloudAuth-Onboarding]] for more details\\r\\n\\r\\n== Using CloudAuth in Prod ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Does CloudAuth support a Prod-Prod use case? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes. CloudAuth doesn't care where the client or resource server are. These are treated equally:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Laptops on the Amazon network\\r\\n* The Corp network\\r\\n* One of the many, regional Prod networks\\r\\n* Public AWS (but not CN)\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Prod services may only support CloudAuth for authorization, and not AAA.\\r\\n\\r\\n== Using CloudAuth in public AWS ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can CloudAuth be used from Lambda/ECS/EMR/Fargate? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes. CloudAuth was designed specifically to support these AWS resources. To use CloudAuth, you need to be able to assume an IAM role and make a call to authorization server to receive an OAuth access token that you can use to call the appropriate resource service.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can Lambda + API Gateway be used as a resource server? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes. CloudAuth is agnostic to the compute platform. CloudAuth only requires the platform provide support for a secure channel to transmit bearer tokens.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo use API Gateway as a proxy with Lambda, you will:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. create a public endpoint and DNS record that clients use access the API. Using a VPC //private endpoint// (or //service endpoint//) only makes the API accessible from within that account, but not from other accounts. But you can always make a //regional// domain name, a public DNS CNAME like ##myapi.us-west-2.myproject.a2z.com## (see [[Nova>>Nova.]]).\\r\\n1. configure API Gateway to use NONE authorization (##AWS_IAM## requires you to sign your request into the ##Authorization## header)\\r\\n1. use a supported library such as ARest-Server-CloudAuth or CloudAuthResourceServerLibJava directly (Java only today)\\r\\n\\r\\nTo run a Lambda resource server, you will:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. follow our [[resource server onboarding guide>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/C2S/CloudAuth/Onboarding/OnboardingResourceServers/#HResourceServerinNativeAWSsupportingClientsinNativeAWS]] for a service that supports both Prod and AWS clients. The only difference between the two sets of steps is who manages your Private Link (AWS -> AWS = you, Prod -> AWS = Allegiance), which doesn't actually matter to you because your API Gateway needs to be public for now anyway (see the private API [[tracking issue>>url:https://i.amazon.com/issues/BPL-8668]]). Other than that, you should be able to create a Private Link from your Lambda's VPC to CloudAuth's service and add the necessary CloudAuth packages in order to get working.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are limitations to this solution that you should consider:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **(MOST IMPORTANT) **API Gateway has support for custom authorization. Response from AWS Lambda (your resource server) will be translated into 200, 401, and 403 response codes **WITHOUT** custom information. See the [[tracking SIM to CloudAuth team>>https://issues.amazon.com/issues/CloudAuth-606/]] and the [[SIM to APIG team>>https://issues.amazon.com/issues/APLUS-4144]] for details\\r\\n1. If you're using a framework (Coral, AREST, etc), the integration with CloudAuth will be easier, but the cold-start time may be high - this now is partially improved by [[PreAuth>>https://issues.amazon.com/CloudAuth-3119]] but it's still a performance problem.\\r\\n1. Caching of CloudAuth tokens/introspection results is less effective causing higher request latency outliers\\r\\n\\r\\nRef: [[https:~~/~~/sage.amazon.com/questions/451690>>url:https://sage.amazon.com/questions/451690]] [[https:~~/~~/sage.amazon.com/questions/494731>>url:https://sage.amazon.com/questions/494731]]\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Are there any special requirements when using CloudAuth from Lambda? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, in order to work correctly, a Lambda that is using CloudAuth requires three things.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, please be sure to follow your team, org, or the company's latest best practices for writing a Lambda which is sufficiently secure for handling your data. CloudAuth endpoints can be accessed either via the public internet or via a private link to CloudAuth's VPC.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond apply the {{code}}AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole{{/code}} IAM policy to your Lambda's IAM Role.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, since CloudAuth's API Gateway is used over the internet, your Lambda will need internet access via a NAT Gateway (if it doesn't already have public internet access). This is generally accomplished by running a Lambda in a private subnet, using a NAT Gateway in the public subnet, and routing public subnet traffic through an Internet Gateway.

When a client opens a stream, they present a CloudAuth token via a header at the start of the HTTP request authorizing the client for the stream. Once the client has been authorized data can be streamed without subsequent authZ checks as Coral will reject anything not modeled for that stream.\\r\\n\\\\\\\\There are a couple of open questions.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. What should happen to the stream when the client's authorization state changes (say a token expires, or is revoked). Coral’s suggestion was to limit all streams to 5 min max to address this scenario without additional code.\\r\\n1. Security review. To the best of my knowledge this plan hasn't been formally reviewed with InfoSec (it may have been informally reviewed by some security folks). It’s worth running this past your security team before rolling it to production.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s a deeper discussion in this CloudAuth office hours ticket https://issues.amazon.com/issues/UnifiedAuth-7281[[https://issues.amazon.com/issues/UnifiedAuth-7281]].\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Which languages have community-supported packages for CloudAuth? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are vended by the community, use with caution and give back if you find problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nChoosing one of these packages is //choosing to support yourself//, you are not guaranteed support, help, speedy response, or that the maintainers still work at Amazon.

The client must choose which region it is interacting with to ensure that it uses the correct regional signature. These CloudAuth packages are vended by the community and are not supported by cloud auth. You should feel empowered to add support for regional endpoints by following the [[CloudAuth Implementers Guide>>url:https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/Implementers_Guide/#HModifyopen-sourceOAuth2.0libraries]].\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What if my language isn't in this list? Can I use a standard OAuth2 library? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nFor applications that don't expose inbound APIs (and so just need CloudAuth to make outbound calls to dependencies), we offer the **CloudAuth Omnis Client**, a language-agnostic solution that enables services unable to use CloudAuth SDKs to call dependencies via CloudAuth. See reference to it on our main onboarding page [[here>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/Onboarding/OnJumpStartConsole]]. There are some restrictions with its use - these are called out in the onboarding guide.\\r\\n\\r\\nOtherwise, yes, CloudAuth is just an implementation of OAuth 2.0, ... kinda.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a few modifications necessary to most open source clients to make them work with CloudAuth. Depending on the quality of the library this ranges from simple to difficult. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor more information see the [[CloudAuth Implementers Guide>>Dev\\\\.CDO.UnifiedAuth.CloudAuth.Implementers_Guide.||anchor=\\\"HModifyopen-sourceOAuth2.0libraries\\\"]].\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Does CloudAuth support calls from the Client direct to a Resource Server host? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe challenges and details are captured in our wiki about the [[host and realm parameters>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/OAuth/HostParameter/]].  \\r\\n\\r\\n=== What public AWS compute environments are supported by CloudAuth and AAA? ===\\r\\n\\r\\n(% border=\\\"1\\\" style=\\\"width:818px\\\" %)\\r\\n|(% style=\\\"width:341px\\\" %)Public AWS Compute Environment / Auth Protocol|(% style=\\\"width:116px\\\" %)CloudAuth|(% style=\\\"width:136px\\\" %)CloudAuth - Vended Identity|(% style=\\\"width:175px\\\" %)AAA-Symmetric|(% style=\\\"width:123px\\\" %)AAA-TLS\\r\\n|(% style=\\\"width:341px\\\" %)EC2|(% style=\\\"width:116px\\\" %)Supported|(% style=\\\"width:136px\\\" %)3/30/20|(% style=\\\"width:175px\\\" %)Supported|(% style=\\\"width:123px\\\" %)Supported\\r\\n|(% style=\\\"width:341px\\\" %)ECS / Fargate|(% style=\\\"width:116px\\\" %)Supported|(% style=\\\"width:136px\\\" %)3/30/20|(% style=\\\"width:175px\\\" %)12/31/19 (client only)|(% style=\\\"width:123px\\\" %)Not Supported\\r\\n|(% style=\\\"width:341px\\\" %)Lambda|(% style=\\\"width:116px\\\" %)Supported|(% style=\\\"width:136px\\\" %)3/30/20|(% style=\\\"width:175px\\\" %)12/31/19 (client only)|(% style=\\\"width:123px\\\" %)Not Supported\\r\\n\\r\\n=== How can I use CDK constructs to develop with CloudAuth? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nSee this High Castle guidance for more information: https://highcastle.a2z.com/#/blueprints/metadata/c805cf65-0ed2-4213-8d26-a973ccb078ae\\r\\n\\r\\n=== How can Away Team members work with CloudAuth? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth’s permissions and identity information are modeled in the AAA datastore. Users of CloudAuth register their AWS identities (IAM Roles) and Apollo Environments within their AAA Application. Environments that have access to those identities are then able to run as the given AAA Application.\\r\\n\\r\\n==== Workflow For Public AWS Users ====\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The away team sets up their own AWS account or is granted access to sandboxed/devo account from the host team.\\r\\n1. The away team creates an IAM Role\\r\\n1.

Host team grants the away team permissions to consume the IAM Role (frequently through Odin)\\r\\n1. Away team deploys the service to their host\\r\\n1*. Note: if calls to the AAA application will be made from the dev desktop, then it is necessary to enable this access.  There are two options:\\r\\n1**. Option 1: Generic \\\"desktop.<service>.a2z.com\\\" endpoint and developers update their hosts file to point \\\"desktop.<service>.a2z.com\\\" to their localhost\\r\\n1***. this has the advantage of not requiring additional endpoint manipulation in AAA's datastore.

Up-to-date information on our current rate limits are available on [[our SLA page>>Dev\\\\.CDO.UnifiedAuth.CloudAuth.SLA.WebHome||anchor=\\\"HServiceLevelObjectives28SLO29\\\"]].\\r\\n\\r\\n== Client Identity ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What client information does CloudAuth provide? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CloudAuth token contains Client ID value ({{code}}client_id{{/code}}). Applications can depend on the value as an opaque (canonical and stable) string for permitted proposes. Applications **SHOULD NOT** depend on the format of the ID (for example, applications **SHOULD NOT** parse the value into components) or use the value for other purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nPermitted purposes are:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Client-specific metrics/alarms\\r\\n* Client-specific throttling configuration\\r\\n* Application and access logging\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecifically excluded purposes included:\\r\\n\\r\\n* custom authorization ([[Vended Identity>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/Onboarding/VendedIdentity]] is the supported alternative)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe value depends on how the client authenticated with CloudAuth.\\r\\n\\r\\n* AAA-TLS: {{code}}\\\"client_id\\\":\\\"urn:cdo:<AAA Application Name>:<Test | Prod>:<Default | CN>\\\"{{/code}}\\r\\n* IAM roles: {{code}}\\\"client_id\\\":\\\"urn:cdo:<AAA Application Name>:AWS:<Default | CN>\\\"{{/code}}\\r\\n\\r\\n==== Why? ====\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the value is stable, taking a dependency on the format of identity strings has caused prior outages.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmazon's authentication and authorization systems may need to change this value in the future, changes will be well communicated and carefully rolled out, including how to update configurations referencing up to update from existing opaque client_id values to new client_id values. The fact that an application wrote custom parsing logic for the ##client_id## will not be taken as reason not to retain the existing value. If the ##client_id## changes teams will be expected to update their code and will be broken if they do not.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a service chooses to parse ##client_id## the service must define its behavior in the event that ##client_id## absent or it cannot be parsed and must have that behavior security reviewed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth currently does not support the [[Additional Information>>AAA.AdditionalInformation.]] that some teams use to store additional client information.\\r\\n\\r\\nCustomers requiring additional client identity information to perform custom authorization should onboard to [[Vended Identity>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/Onboarding/VendedIdentity]].\\r\\n\\r\\n== Vended Identity ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== I am filling out a [[SIM>>https://issues.amazon.com/issues/create?assignedFolder=3dc72621-4052-4654-9bb4-0d0eb92644f6&title=Onboarding+to+Vended+Identity+for+%5Byour+service+name%5D&description=**Your+Service+Name**+%0A%0A**Approval+from+InfoSec**++-+CloudAuth+store+is+already+approved+by+InfoSec+as+policy+engine+to+be+used+across+CDO.+If+you%E2%80%99re+using+a+custom+authorization+solution+requiring+AAA+or+IAM+Identity+information%2C+you+need+infoSec+approval.+Once+you+have+that%2C+have+InfoSec+put+a+comment+here%2C+or+you+can+reference+the+ticket+or+email..etc.%0A%0A**Required+identity+data+**+-+AAA+id%2C+application+name%2C+environment%2FIAM+role+name%2C+region%2C+what+are+you+after%3F%0A%0A**CloudAuth+Client+Id**+-+in+the+format+of+%3Cfully+qualified+domain+name%3E%2F%3Cservice+name%3E+%28must+be+an+exact+match%29%0A%0A**Redirect+URL**+-+The+url+that+CloudAuth+redirects+the+customer+to+%28must+be+an+exact+match%29%0A&descriptionContentType=text%2Famz-markdown-sim&extensions%5Btt%5D%5Bcategory%5D=]] to onboard to Vended Identity and it's asking for a redirect uri, what is the redirect uri? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease refer to our [[sequence diagrams>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/OIDC/SequenceDiagrams/]]. A high level summary of the sequence diagram is this:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Clients call the resource server without a valid identity token.\\r\\n1. The resource server redirects clients to CloudAuth to get an identity token, along with a **redirect_uri** query parameter.\\r\\n1. Clients ask CloudAuth for an identity token, and includes the **redirect_uri** in the request.\\r\\n1. CloudAuth validates that the **redirect_uri** is configured for the resource server.\\r\\n1. CloudAuth sends the client a 302 redirect to the **redirect_uri**, along with their identity token.\\r\\n1. Client makes a request to the **redirect_uri** with their identity token\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What if I need to migrate my Vended Identity Redirect URI? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth allows resource servers to register multiple Redirect URIs.\\r\\n\\r\\nredirect_uris are specified by the resource server. Resource servers redirect clients to the CloudAuth server and provide a redirect_uri via query parameters (reference our [[sequence diagrams>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/OIDC/SequenceDiagrams/#HResourceServerRedirect]]). Clients then make an /authorization_grant request against CloudAuth server with the same redirect_uri provided. CloudAuth matches the provided redirect_uri against those configured as acceptable by the resource server.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis way resource servers can register their new redirect_uri with CloudAuth and begin using it at their own pace.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== I want to onboard to vended identity, but my service uses REST apis so I can't possibly register all the possible Redirect URIs ===\\r\\n\\r\\nThe redirect_uri specified by the resource server's redirect to the auth server does NOT have to exactly match the REST API requested by the client. Instead, resource servers can use the state parameter defined by the [[OpenID spec>>https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest]] and noted in our [[sequence diagrams>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/OIDC/SequenceDiagrams/#HResourceServerRedirect]] to send some sort of token indicating where the original request was sent. Quoting the OpenID spec the state variable is an \\\"Opaque value used to maintain state between the request and the callback\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, services authenticating human users should create a login_successful endpoint and use state either to capture the original request information and serve it from there.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor services only using software clients, you could use state to redirect the client back to the resource they originally requested from a login_successful endpoint.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Which Scopes Do I Need? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nScopes are space-delimited values. In order to receive an identity token from the client's /authorization_grant request the client must request the {{code}}openid{{/code}} scope as described in the [[OIDC spec>>https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest]]. CloudAuth currently defines the following scopes and what they provide:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. scope - {{code}}openid{{/code}}\\r\\n1*. AAA Identity ID\\r\\n1*. IAM Role\\r\\n1. scope - {{code}}https://cloudauth.a2z.com/scopes/aaa#identityInfo{{/code}}\\r\\n1*. [[All AAA identity information>>https://code.amazon.com/packages/CloudAuthCore/blobs/dbdd66dfe8e853798604acafef6c7d333eb775b0/--/src/main/java/com/amazon/cloudauth/util/OIDCConstants.java#L45]]\\r\\n\\r\\nBear in mind for scopes other than {{code}}openid{{/code}}, CloudAuth must make remote calls to other services (like AAA) and will have an impact on latency.\\r\\n\\r\\n== Operations ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What is the expected maintenance effort (patching/updates/migrations) after onboarding CloudAuth? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nPatching and updates are handled through standard CI/CD. And of course if there are any issues, we provide full Tier-1 support, the same level as AAA provides the support.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== I'm getting error messages from CloudAuth, what do they mean? ===\\r\\n\\r\\n[[See this answer>>.||anchor=\\\"H== Is there help for CloudAuth error messages? ===\\\"]]\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What is guidance for peak periods like Prime Day? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nThat will not change no matter you use AAA or CloudAuth, meaning if you are not a peak-sensitive team now, you will remain the same after onboarding with CloudAuth.\\r\\n\\r\\n==== Retail Restricted/Blocked Days and CloudAuth ====\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth is a Tier-1 service, subject to Retail restricted days like Prime Day. During restricted periods, we do not make discretionary deployments.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Customer Impact**\\r\\n\\r\\nThis has impact for you **only** if you are:\\r\\n\\r\\n* **Deploying** to public AWS\\r\\n* **AND** do **not** have an **existing AWS account allowlisted** to create PrivateLinks to the CloudAuth VPC\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you deploy in MAWS, you can work toward or meet your S-Team goal of enabling AWS accessibility for your service without impact. You can use {{code}}catvet{{/code}} or Coral Diver to verify your service's ability to use CloudAuth as an AuthZ protocol for your service.\\r\\nAAA relationship request will continue to be approved. \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Prime Day 2019 period, Allegiance will be suspending the creation of new PrivateLinks as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n==== When will my PrivateLink Allowlisting request be processed? ====\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivateLink allowlisting is automated and normally completes within 5 minutes. (Allow-listing was automated in May 2020).\\r\\n\\r\\n==== Exception Requests for Critical Business Cases ====\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have a **critical **business case for Prime Day 2019 please create a [[SIM using our template>>https://sim.amazon.com/issues/create?template=b9be7be3-3ecb-4a2b-942b-01499585d497]]. Note that you will //also //have to get an exception from the Allegiance Team to create the PrivateLink. See [[their FAQ for Prime Day 2019>>Allegiance.PD2019]] for more details.\\r\\n\\r\\n==== I need to test or develop in public AWS and these restrictions impact my schedule ====\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some suggested workarounds for developing a public AWS solution from within Corp. This will allow you to make some progress if you haven't submitted your allowlisting PrivateLink request before the team's final provisioning day before the restricted period begins.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that you can develop and test normally from the Corp and Prod networks using CloudAuth as there is an existing PrivateLink you use transparently, and AAA relationships can still be registered.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are developing a Lambda, consider using SAM - [[Internal link>>https://w.amazon.com/index.php/SAMToolkit]] / [[External link>>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html]].\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the restricted dates have completed, all outstanding requests will be processed.\\r\\n\\r\\n== Region Support ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Does CloudAuth support cross-region and/or external network calls? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes to both with //a few caveats//. See this [[Sage question>>https://sage.amazon.com/questions/419772]] for the latest.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Do I need to call the AuthServer to which the resource server is talking to (assuming the resource server is in a different region)? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. You should always talk to your local/preferred AuthServer. Tokens issued from CloudAuth/IAD can be recognized by CloudAuth/DUB when introspected and vice versa. It's an anti-pattern to setup different CloudAuth clients talking to different CloudAuth regions.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== How do I know which CloudAuth server I am talking to? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nIf your service runs in MAWS, its requests to CloudAuth will be routed based on latency, as AAA-TLS certificates are recognized and accepted by all Auth servers.\\r\\nIf your service runs in PAWS, its requests to CloudAuth will be routed based on the region in which your IAM role was signed. For example,\\r\\n(% class=\\\"inline-code\\\" %)CloudAuthCredentials credentials = new CloudAuthCredentials.RegionalAwsCredentials(credentialsProvider,'us-east-1');\\r\\n\\r\\nRequests using these credentials will be routed to us-east-1 (IAD).\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What regions are supported by CloudAuth? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth is deployed in the following regions:\\r\\n\\r\\n{{transclude name=\\\"space:Dev\\\\.CDO.UnifiedAuth.CloudAuth.Onboarding.Endpoints\\\"/}}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is the [[tracking SIM>>https://issues.amazon.com/issues/CloudAuth-721]] for additional regions.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== CloudAuth isn't in the region I'm in, what are my options? ===\\r\\n\\r\\n==== CloudAuth Network Connectivity ====\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a complete list of cross region/fabric connectivity options, see the [[BubbleBridge Regions wiki>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BubbleBridge/Regions/]].\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth can be used from a region without a local Auth Server. CloudAuth tokens are can be fetched and used in any region if you can establish network connectivity to the Auth Server. [[BubbleBridge>>https://w.amazon.com/index.php/BubbleBridge]] solves this problems for teams in Public AWS and in their own VPCs. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you're using IAM credentials you'll need to ensure that your application assumes a role in the same AWS region as the CloudAuth installation your using. \\r\\n\\r\\n----\\r\\n\\r\\nThe options below are \\\"replacements\\\" for CloudAuth and not a way to reach CloudAuth from a different region. If you are already on-boarded onto CloudAuth, we suggest using BubbleBridge as mentioned above. If you are still deciding on which Authentication/Authorization provider to use, please also read our [[FAQ/Alternatives to CloudAuth>>https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/FAQ/#HAlternativestoCloudAuth]] to learn more about trade-offs of using or not using CloudAuth.\\r\\n\\r\\n==== IAM Auth ====\\r\\n\\r\\nServices can also use IAM Auth. This will require using an Api Gateway and manually adding and maintaining identities and permissions via IAM policies.\\r\\n\\r\\n==== Cognito ====\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly if your service accepts calls from humans AWS Cognito is available. As with IAM Auth it requires manual maintenance of permissions via IAM policies.\\r\\n\\r\\n==== Midway ====\\r\\n\\r\\nMidway offers authentication for employees and other humans within the Amazon ecosystem. A service can require midway credentials for authentication and create/maintain its own authorization data/allow-list.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can CloudAuth be used in China regions? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes. CloudAuth China region (cn-north-1) is available now.\\r\\nPlease refer to this wiki to start onboarding: https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/Onboarding/CloudAuthCN/\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What can be used for authorization in China? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nFor connectivity within the China regions IAM Auth is currently the option. AAA-TLS is not supported in China region.\\r\\nPlease follow this wiki for details: https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/Onboarding/CloudAuthCN/\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What rules are there for making cross-region calls between China and other regions? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth will follow the same advice and rules that [[AAA currently uses>>AAA.Guide.Onboarding.Service.Gotchas||anchor=\\\"Security_Regions\\\"]] for cross-region calls to or from China.\\r\\n\\r\\nCN has special rules governing cross-region traffic and how data is handled. By default, AAA will fail calls between CN and another region. If you need to communicate between CN and other regions, you need to get a cross region exception. Please let us know if this is an issue for you so that we may discuss it further. [[Exceptions can be requested.>>AAA.UsersGuide.CrossRegionCalling.]]\\r\\n\\r\\n== Security ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can I use CloudAuth over HTTP? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, all CloudAuth communications must be over TLS end-to-end. See [[Onboarding TLS>>Dev\\\\.CDO.UnifiedAuth.CloudAuth.Onboarding.Prerequisites||anchor=\\\"#HSetUpEnd-to-EndTLSforYourServices\\\"]] for more details.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== What does CloudAuth mean by \\\"TLS end-to-end\\\"? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nAll CloudAuth communications must flow over TLS; all network hops between client and resource server and CloudAuth must flow over TLS. An unbroken channel is fine, terminating and reopening (e.g. at a load balancer) is fine provided \\\"all network hops flow over TLS\\\" remains true.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Why does CloudAuth require TLS end-to-end? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudAuth-issued credentials must be kept confidential in transit to protect against man in the middle attacks, replay attacks, and other vulnerabilities. TLS end-to-end, TLS over every network hop, provides the required transport-level protection.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== How does CloudAuth's TLS end-to-end requirement map to InfoSec guidance? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong InfoSec's 3 recommended TLS termination options at time of writing, only 1 ([[on-host termination>>https://skb.highcastle.a2z.com/guides/128#TcH9CAQDx9c]]) and 3 ([[TLS termination at VPC Edge, with TLS resumed to back-end host>>https://skb.highcastle.a2z.com/guides/128#TcH9CAqHG29]]) satisfy CloudAuth's end-to-end TLS requirement, with 1 being strongly preferred. 2 ([[TLS termination at VPC edge, clear text to back-end host>>https://skb.highcastle.a2z.com/guides/128#TcH9CAi59Gz]]) is not OK.\\r\\n\\r\\n2 fails \\\"all network hops are over TLS\\\" as everything within the VPC is sent in the clear. Though InfoSec accepts 2 combined with compensating controls (e.g. security group), CloudAuth currently has no means to validate whether any of those compensating controls are present/enforced, much less whether they sufficiently protect credentials flowing throughout the VPC. We'd need to verify full network setup, VPC actors, etc. but are still working on a list of gaps: raw permissions/visibility, APIs from Conduit/BuilderTools/Service Intelligence/AWS to help ourselves, clear definitions from InfoSec for what is/isn't acceptable. As a result, we can't allow 2 at this time.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Has CloudAuth been certified by InfoSec? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, CloudAuth is fully certified and endorsed by InfoSec. [[CloudAuth in Anvil>>https://anvil.amazon.com/applications/70502]]\\r\\n\\r\\n=== How is this different from AAA-Symmetric? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nAAA-Symmetric is available in Prod/Corp and only supports EC2 AWS types in Public AWS ([[Nebula roadmap>>Nebula.Roadmap.]]). ECS and Lambda are not supported by AAA-Symmetric. CloudAuth is a new service in Public AWS (or spanning different environments) to authenticate and authorize calls between services. CloudAuth does not require a daemon or a thick client side library nor the lengthy bootstrap process.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some important differences between AAA-Symmetric and CloudAuth that you'll need to be aware of:\\r\\n\\r\\n* While AAA-Symmetric encrypts the payload and communicates over HTTP, CloudAuth tokens are placed in the HTTP ##Authorization## header, so all CloudAuth communication must occur over TLS (HTTPS) ([[CloudAuth onboarding>>Dev\\\\.CDO.UnifiedAuth.CloudAuth.Onboarding.]])\\r\\n* CloudAuth doesn't have any concept of passthrough mode\\r\\n* CloudAuth currently doesn't support the [[Additional Information>>AAA.AdditionalInformation.]] that exists in the runtime client (we're looking into adding it in the future)\\r\\n* No support for airgapped regions (e.g. DCA, LCK)\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can I log an access token? client identity assertion? identity token? ===\\r\\n\\r\\n(% class=\\\"box errormessage\\\" %)\\r\\n(((\\r\\nNo.\\r\\nCredentials issued by CloudAuth are bearer credentials, anyone in possession of these credentials can use them to gain access or impersonate a valid client.\\r\\n)))\\r\\n\\r\\nCredentials issued by CloudAuth should **never** be logged in full. Based on the data handling standard introspection responses can be logged to clarify the claims present in a token, but the signature must never be logged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=== If token validity is 12 hours, why should I refresh tokens before they expire? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nClients using their tokens up to their expiry time introduces latency and availability risks. Fortunately the CloudAuthStandardJava client [[handles refreshing tokens in advance of their expiry>>https://code.amazon.com/packages/CloudAuthStandardJavaClient/blobs/54d051d4714431bbed2869aee5b752f4b025f912/--/src/main/java/com/amazon/cloudauth/client/CloudAuthCache.java#L320-L371,L130,L131,L132]] (currently at 90%) of their lifetime.\\r\\n\\r\\nClients may see latency or call failures if they make calls to a resource server with a token at it's expiry time. If the client presents an expired token the resource server will reject the call with a challenge. The client call will either fail or will need to fetch a new token in band and retry the call to get the resource requested. Fetching a token in band and retrying the call will increase latency by the cost of the two additional calls.\\r\\n\\r\\nRefreshing a token in advance of its expiry also improves availability for clients and services. In the case of a CloudAuth outage clients and services can continue to communicate using previously fetched tokens up to the token's expiry. Re-fetching a token before it expires gives the client a buffer of active time to fetch a new token should a call to re-fetch a token fail.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Why do introspection results need to be refreshed every 15 minutes? ===\\r\\n\\r\\n(% class=\\\"box warningmessage\\\" %)\\r\\n(((\\r\\nIntrospection results on the resource server need to be refreshed ever 15 minutes, tokens use by the clients should be refetched at 80%-90% of their lifetime.\\r\\n)))\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 12 hour lifetime of a token is a balance between availability and security. For the lifetime of a token a client and resource server can communicate successfully without contacting the Auth Server, removing the Auth Server from that communication also removes the Auth Server as an availability risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what if a token is exposed to an unintended party? The nature of bearer credentials means that the unintended party would be able to spoof the client for the life of the token.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo limit the potential for data leaks resource servers should periodically verify that an access token is still valid for use. At present the guidance is to verify this every 15 minutes by making a remote introspection call to the Auth Server. This allows the Auth Server to revoke the access granted by a specific access token forcing the client to fetch a new token. To maintain availability the existing introspection result should be used in the case of remote introspection failure.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== If I remove an operation from an relationship, how long it will take before the clients got rejected? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 15 minutes and 24 hours, due to various propagation delays in the underlying storage (S3 and Dynamo DB) and caches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=== If I remove an identity from a application, how long it will take before the clients got rejected? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 15 minutes and 24 hours, due to various propagation delays in the underlying storage (S3 and Dynamo DB) and caches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== HTTP/S and TLS ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can I use a self-signed certificate ===\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. The standard CloudAuthJava Client and Resource server components will error if you try and use a self signed certificate.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== I'm getting a self-signed certificate error, but I am using a Redfort certificate ===\\r\\n\\r\\nCoral will fail through to a self-signed certificate if it can't find a keystore or trust store at activation-time.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== How can I determine if I am using a self-signed certificate? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nLook for Issuer=Subject in the certificate. [[An answer can be found in Sage 670257>>https://sage.amazon.com/posts/670257]].\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can I use JLBRelay with CloudAuth ===\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of this moment [June 25, 2019], JLBRelay isn't compatible with the CloudAuth resource server components. Use the CDORelay fork instead.\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can I use CloudAuth over HTTP? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. [[See this answer too>>.||anchor=\\\"HCanIuseCloudAuthoverHTTP3F\\\"]].\\r\\n\\r\\n== Ownership ==\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Who is responsible for CloudAuth? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CloudAuth team within the Consumer Cloud Enablement (CCE) department.

Client packages have been built and tested for use on AL2 (both x86_64 and aarch_64 platforms).\\r\\n\\r\\n=== Can I disable CloudAuth remote telemetry? ===\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficial Coral and ARest CloudAuth libraries remotely report telemetry to CloudAccessTelemetryService (CATS).

Often, this means addressing issues the oncall didn't have context on, which makes this a group ticket solving meeting. This makes the meeting less effective as a handoff and encourages putting off solving an issue instead of tackling immediately.\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Solution: Switched ops handoff meeting format; instead of the outgoing oncall running the meeting, the incoming oncall drives with a focus on \\\\\\\\\\\"What do I need to know for my oncall week?\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Benefit\\\\*\\\\*: As the incoming oncall now drives the meeting, we are more focused on what the previous oncall learned in the context of issues we foresee in the coming week. This helps the new oncall learn what they need to know for their week.

Thousands of customers have successfully migrated to the AWS cloud and run successful workloads that are secure, available, and reliable. Customers will learn best from the case studies of companies who are similar to them in size, industry, workload, etc.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*ArisGlobal performs successful and compliant migration in a highly regulated industry.\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\nArisGlobal delivers software solutions to major life sciences organizations, helping them streamline the drug development process. Aris Global was interested in cloud migration but they were hesitant to migrate because of the industry regulations they must meet. After carefully considering their cloud options, ArisGlobal decided on AWS, trusting that AWS would keep their customer data secure. AWS is ISO/IEC 27001, SOC 2, HIPAA, and the General Data Protection Regulation compliant. Using Database Migration Service \\\\(DMS\\\\), ArisGlobal migrated over 100TB of database workloads to Amazon RDS for Oracle. They completed the initial migration using a lift and shift strategy, and have since been utilizing other AWS services to optimize the workload. They use Elasticache for Redis to cache the data, and deliver it with lower latency. They also optimized using Amazon Elasticsearch service and Elastic Kubernetes Service \\\\(EKS\\\\). With the successful completion of their migration, ArisGlobal successfully launched LifeSphere, a Software as a Solution \\\\(SaaS\\\\) cloud platform for pharmaceutical companies. ArisGlobal is enjoying benefits such as 50% less database hits, eliminated licensing fees, and reduced troubleshooting time from 35-45 minutes to seconds, and automated deployments in minutes.^^1^^\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*The world’s largest retailer, Amazon, successfully leaves behind legacy databases for cloud-native solutions.\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\nOnline retail powerhouse Amazon.com was created in a time before AWS, when monolithic, on premises databases solutions were the most available and logical for the amount of data Amazon was managing. Amazon had to deal with the complexities of disengaging with legacy databases. Amazon had a fleet of more than 5,000 databases, 50 petabytes of data. The company was also concerned with how the move would impact their employees and if employees would leave as a result of the transition. However, the cost associated with licensing on Oracle led Amazon to take on the large task. Amazon utilized schema conversion tool \\\\(SCT\\\\) and database migration service to make their heterogenous migration possible. For some workloads, they opted to migrate to Amazon Aurora. They also opted to migrate a large number of their critical workloads to DynamoDB, an AWS fully managed NoSQL database. As a result of their migration, Amazon cut database operating costs by 50% and lowered the latency of most critical services by 40%. Additionally, Amazon engineers who were managing the difficulties with Oracle on premises now have the time to innovate on behalf of customers rather than deal with databases.^^2^^\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Expedia significantly lowers latency of payment processing for travelers and vendors globally.\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\nExpedia Group \\\\(Expedia\\\\) leads the way as a constantly growing online travel platform. Taking and delivering payments on global scale is a large part of Expedia’s business model. Expedia owns multiple booking sites, handling travelers from over 70 countries, and more than 80 different currencies. Expedia was experiencing delays in their account payable reconciliation \\\\(APRecon\\\\), leading to a domino of effect that impacted end users. Their current APRecon was running on SQL Server, leading to vendor lock in and high costs. After examining their options in the cloud and on premises, Expedia ultimately decided to migrate to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL. The switch to Aurora, as well as using Amazon Simple Queue Service \\\\(SQS\\\\), Simple Storage Service \\\\(S3\\\\) and the Matching and Reconciliation System \\\\(MARS\\\\) to decouple their infrastructure and implement scalable microservices. As a result of making these changes on AWS, Expedia was able to reduce their manual touch rate for processing partner payments from 17% to 0.06%. They are also able to deliver near real time data to their users and vendors in less than 1 second, rather than the previous system when there was a processing time of more than 1 day.^^3^^  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Cathay Pacific Airlines increases performance and lowers downtime with successful migration to AWS.\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\nCathay Pacific Airlines \\\\(Cathay Pacific\\\\) is a Hong Kong based airline, operating both passenger and cargo flights in over 200 locations globally. Cathay Pacific needs to ensure their Passenger Revenue Optimization System \\\\(PROS\\\\) is running efficiently and securely to ensure they are optimizing revenue and customers can rely on the airline to handle booking appropriately. Cathay had already migrated more than 65 of their applications to AWS, cutting their costs by 50% and speeding up the software development cycle by 67%. Prior to migrating the PROS, Cathay had increased their availability from 99.5% to 99.9% from 2019 to 2020. Despite these successes, Cathay was hesitant to migrate to the PROS because of the size and computing power required from the system. Due to the trust Cathay had in AWS from prior success, they chose to migrate the system to Amazon RDS for Oracle. The switch to RDS lead to a 20% increase in performance for the system and shortened the downtime during backups windows from 10 hours to 6-7 hours. AWS also allowed them to automate security processes, freeing staff to focus on innovation. This extra time for innovation helped them to further improve the customer booking experience with new software features.^^4^^\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Experian successfully expands business model and services offered due to AWS database migration.\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\nAfter being known mostly as a credit bureau, Experian made business decisions to expand their footprint. They also wanted to be known as a company that assists individually and businesses in utilizing the power of data to drive decisions, helps to prevent fraud, and assists people in taking control of their overall financial life. As Experian made the decision to grow and expand, they knew their on-premises architecture would not support the company any longer. They made the decision to focus on AWS microservices to decouple their architecture and increase scalability and security. Their first major move was from Microsoft SQL Server to DynamoDB, an AWS fully manage NoSQL solution. As a part of their growth, Experian acquired CSIdentity \\\\(CSID\\\\) and then chose to migrate to Amazon Aurora MySQL to replace their legacy relational database. Immediately after acquiring CSID, Experian first migrated the database system to an EC2 instance running the MySQL database. Later, they decided to modernize the system by migrating to Aurora. The move from EC2 to Aurora saw a 10% improvement in response times, replication lag times were cut in half, backup runtime decreased by 95%, and cost decreased by 35%. CSID now experiences 100% uptime. Experian was able to free themselves from only offering credit reports to using the capabilities of DynamoDB and Aurora to provide users with a more complete image of the financial identity.^^5^^  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Pokémon Company is able to securely accommodate over 300 million users with AWS fully managed database services.\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\nJapan based Pokémon has been a leading entertainment company since 1996, creating stable products such as trading cards and the Pokémon GO game. Pokémon supports user accounts to allow users to track their achievements in the mobile game and with trading cards. The user profile system consists of two large sets of data for the two sectors of the company. The two sectors require different processes and maintenance, making the task more complex. The popular Pokémon GO mobile game lead the number of users to increase to more than 300 million in just two years. Pokémon was outsourcing to a NoSQL document database with fast read times, but they ran into issues managing more than 300 complex nodes and indices to achieve the speed they wanted. When certain nodes went down, users would lose access to the system and the operating team had to leave all other work to get the node back up and running. Pokémon was already using EC2, Elastic Load Balancer and S3 with success, and decided to migrate to AWS fully managed database services, using Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL. After the migration, the company was able to lessen the number of nodes from 300 to 30, monthly costs have dropped by tens of thousands of dollars, and after having 168 hours of downtime/performance degradation in the past 6 months, they have had zero hours since migrating. They have also modernized using DynamoDB TTL to track log in attempts and deny entry at the threshold, helping to limit the number of bot log in attempts and Elasticache service to reduce the time spent managing Memcached nodes for the company.^^6^^ \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Decisiv learns the true value of cloud migration, freeing their employees to focus on innovation.\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\nDecisiv is a startup delivering cloud-based service relationship management \\\\(SRM\\\\) SaaS solutions for the commercial trucking industry to manage their fleets. Decisiv needed a highly available database to support their critical workload as any downtime is a loss of revenue and business to their customers. They also needed a scalable environment to allow their business to grow. The chief technology officer, Satish Joshi, also expressed wanting the development team to be able to create and deploy software at a more rapid pace. The company initially migrated to Amazon RDS for SQL Server, and later modernized by moving the workload to Aurora PostgreSQL. AWS multi availably zone deployment increased their uptime from 98 percent to over 99 percent for their critical workload.

This substantial project is set to underscore ROX's proficiency as a trusted partner for intricate IT initiatives, predominantly those involving data and database migration.\\\\\\\\nDelicate Dance of Data Migration\\\\\\\\nCrucial for government bodies dealing with vast amounts of sensitive data, data migration entails the movement of information from legacy systems to new-age platforms. This complex process is underscored by the necessity to uphold data integrity, security, and compliance. ROX's expertise is being put to the test, as maintaining these critical elements during data transition is a challenging task that demands an in-depth understanding of both the old and the new systems.\\\\\\\\nEnhancing Performance with Database Migration\\\\\\\\nSimultaneously, database migration emerges as a vital component for boosting performance and accessibility. The primary objective is to address the prevalent issue of data silos in public sector organizations. By consolidating and migrating databases, ROX aims to dissolve these silos, thereby enhancing operational efficiency, fostering data-driven decision-making, and improving service delivery to citizens.\\\\\\\\nROX's Commitment to Digital Transformation\\\\\\\\nJim Rakesh, the Managing Director of ROX Hi Tech Limited, conveyed his enthusiasm about the contract, positing it as validation of ROX's aptitude in handling complex IT projects and their pledge to impactful digital transformation for their clientele. Rakesh stressed the significance of their work in the public sector and their dedication to effecting positive developments in both operational efficiency and citizen services.\\\\\\\\nComprehending the intricacies of database migration, particularly on platforms such as AWS, is integral to the successful execution of this project.

Utilizing features like AWS Schema Conversion Tool \\\\(SCT\\\\) and AWS DMS Schema Conversion, ROX Hi-Tech is poised to navigate this complex undertaking, paving the way for a more digitally evolved public sector.\\\\\\\\n\\\\* CCC \\\\(2025\\\\): Oracle -> Aurora PG\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\* Internal story. Insurance software industry.\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\* CCC successfully migrated from a 175TB+ Oracle footprint to Aurora PostgreSQL on AWS. The end-state architecture features Aurora PostgreSQL with replication to a reporting Aurora PostgreSQL cluster. AWS Database Migration Service \\\\(DMS\\\\) provides the tooling for the replication pipeline. AWS teams sized 15+ Aurora PostgreSQL instances to match or exceed the performance of the original Oracle infrastructure. The migration approach employed Oracle to Aurora PostgreSQL using DMS. Specialist team ensured that the cutover strategy and reverse replication setup plans were sound. CCC adapted their strategy during cutover, opting for a full-load via DMS to mitigate risks associated with delta data change rates. This successful migration demonstrated AWS' capability to handle the most complex database transitions from Oracle to PostgreSQL. The launch empowers CCC to reduce vendor lock-in and achieving substantial cost savings through Oracle license elimination. This achievement reinforces AWS' position as a preferred destination for enterprises seeking to modernize their database infrastructure and optimize costs while eliminating expensive proprietary licensing agreements \\\\($4.5M annually\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n=== DMA Case Studies ===\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\* BMC Software: https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/bmc-software-case-study/\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Thomson Reuters: https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/thomson-reuters-video-case-study/\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Isetan: https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/isetan-mitsukoshi-case-study/ \\\\\\\\n\\\\* RWEST: https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/rwe-case-study/ \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n=== Table of references ===\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| |Customer|Type of migration|Region/Country|Industry|App classification|Case Study link|Source |Target|Aurora|Partner involved?\\\\\\\\n|3|Ventek international|heterogeneous| | |Data warehouse| |Oracle|MySQL|yes| \\\\\\\\n|16|Macromill|heterogeneous| | | | |Oracle|MySQL|yes|Insight Technology Inc\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n=== Technology Partners \\\\(ISVs\\\\) ===\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Pegasystems: Oracle -> PostgreSQL\\\\\\\\n\\\\* BMC Remedy: Oracle / SQL Server -> PostgreSQL \\\\(still in process, but willing to be a reference\\\\)\\\\\\\\n\\\\* LogicBay: Oracle -> PostgreSQL\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Blackboard Oracle -> RDS PostgreSQL\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Cheshire Datasystems \\\\(CDL - UK\\\\) Oracle -> RDS PostgreSQL.

Thousands of customers have successfully migrated to the AWS cloud and run successful workloads that are secure, available, and reliable. Customers will learn best from the case studies of companies who are similar to them in size, industry, workload, etc.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*ArisGlobal performs successful and compliant migration in a highly regulated industry.\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\nArisGlobal delivers software solutions to major life sciences organizations, helping them streamline the drug development process. Aris Global was interested in cloud migration but they were hesitant to migrate because of the industry regulations they must meet. After carefully considering their cloud options, ArisGlobal decided on AWS, trusting that AWS would keep their customer data secure. AWS is ISO/IEC 27001, SOC 2, HIPAA, and the General Data Protection Regulation compliant. Using Database Migration Service \\\\(DMS\\\\), ArisGlobal migrated over 100TB of database workloads to Amazon RDS for Oracle. They completed the initial migration using a lift and shift strategy, and have since been utilizing other AWS services to optimize the workload. They use Elasticache for Redis to cache the data, and deliver it with lower latency. They also optimized using Amazon Elasticsearch service and Elastic Kubernetes Service \\\\(EKS\\\\). With the successful completion of their migration, ArisGlobal successfully launched LifeSphere, a Software as a Solution \\\\(SaaS\\\\) cloud platform for pharmaceutical companies. ArisGlobal is enjoying benefits such as 50% less database hits, eliminated licensing fees, and reduced troubleshooting time from 35-45 minutes to seconds, and automated deployments in minutes.^^1^^\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*The world’s largest retailer, Amazon, successfully leaves behind legacy databases for cloud-native solutions.\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\nOnline retail powerhouse Amazon.com was created in a time before AWS, when monolithic, on premises databases solutions were the most available and logical for the amount of data Amazon was managing. Amazon had to deal with the complexities of disengaging with legacy databases. Amazon had a fleet of more than 5,000 databases, 50 petabytes of data. The company was also concerned with how the move would impact their employees and if employees would leave as a result of the transition. However, the cost associated with licensing on Oracle led Amazon to take on the large task. Amazon utilized schema conversion tool \\\\(SCT\\\\) and database migration service to make their heterogenous migration possible. For some workloads, they opted to migrate to Amazon Aurora. They also opted to migrate a large number of their critical workloads to DynamoDB, an AWS fully managed NoSQL database. As a result of their migration, Amazon cut database operating costs by 50% and lowered the latency of most critical services by 40%. Additionally, Amazon engineers who were managing the difficulties with Oracle on premises now have the time to innovate on behalf of customers rather than deal with databases.^^2^^\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Expedia significantly lowers latency of payment processing for travelers and vendors globally.\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\nExpedia Group \\\\(Expedia\\\\) leads the way as a constantly growing online travel platform. Taking and delivering payments on global scale is a large part of Expedia’s business model. Expedia owns multiple booking sites, handling travelers from over 70 countries, and more than 80 different currencies. Expedia was experiencing delays in their account payable reconciliation \\\\(APRecon\\\\), leading to a domino of effect that impacted end users. Their current APRecon was running on SQL Server, leading to vendor lock in and high costs. After examining their options in the cloud and on premises, Expedia ultimately decided to migrate to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL. The switch to Aurora, as well as using Amazon Simple Queue Service \\\\(SQS\\\\), Simple Storage Service \\\\(S3\\\\) and the Matching and Reconciliation System \\\\(MARS\\\\) to decouple their infrastructure and implement scalable microservices. As a result of making these changes on AWS, Expedia was able to reduce their manual touch rate for processing partner payments from 17% to 0.06%. They are also able to deliver near real time data to their users and vendors in less than 1 second, rather than the previous system when there was a processing time of more than 1 day.^^3^^  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Cathay Pacific Airlines increases performance and lowers downtime with successful migration to AWS.\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\nCathay Pacific Airlines \\\\(Cathay Pacific\\\\) is a Hong Kong based airline, operating both passenger and cargo flights in over 200 locations globally. Cathay Pacific needs to ensure their Passenger Revenue Optimization System \\\\(PROS\\\\) is running efficiently and securely to ensure they are optimizing revenue and customers can rely on the airline to handle booking appropriately. Cathay had already migrated more than 65 of their applications to AWS, cutting their costs by 50% and speeding up the software development cycle by 67%. Prior to migrating the PROS, Cathay had increased their availability from 99.5% to 99.9% from 2019 to 2020. Despite these successes, Cathay was hesitant to migrate to the PROS because of the size and computing power required from the system. Due to the trust Cathay had in AWS from prior success, they chose to migrate the system to Amazon RDS for Oracle. The switch to RDS lead to a 20% increase in performance for the system and shortened the downtime during backups windows from 10 hours to 6-7 hours. AWS also allowed them to automate security processes, freeing staff to focus on innovation. This extra time for innovation helped them to further improve the customer booking experience with new software features.^^4^^\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Experian successfully expands business model and services offered due to AWS database migration.\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\nAfter being known mostly as a credit bureau, Experian made business decisions to expand their footprint. They also wanted to be known as a company that assists individually and businesses in utilizing the power of data to drive decisions, helps to prevent fraud, and assists people in taking control of their overall financial life. As Experian made the decision to grow and expand, they knew their on-premises architecture would not support the company any longer. They made the decision to focus on AWS microservices to decouple their architecture and increase scalability and security. Their first major move was from Microsoft SQL Server to DynamoDB, an AWS fully manage NoSQL solution. As a part of their growth, Experian acquired CSIdentity \\\\(CSID\\\\) and then chose to migrate to Amazon Aurora MySQL to replace their legacy relational database. Immediately after acquiring CSID, Experian first migrated the database system to an EC2 instance running the MySQL database. Later, they decided to modernize the system by migrating to Aurora. The move from EC2 to Aurora saw a 10% improvement in response times, replication lag times were cut in half, backup runtime decreased by 95%, and cost decreased by 35%. CSID now experiences 100% uptime. Experian was able to free themselves from only offering credit reports to using the capabilities of DynamoDB and Aurora to provide users with a more complete image of the financial identity.^^5^^  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Pokémon Company is able to securely accommodate over 300 million users with AWS fully managed database services.\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\nJapan based Pokémon has been a leading entertainment company since 1996, creating stable products such as trading cards and the Pokémon GO game. Pokémon supports user accounts to allow users to track their achievements in the mobile game and with trading cards. The user profile system consists of two large sets of data for the two sectors of the company. The two sectors require different processes and maintenance, making the task more complex. The popular Pokémon GO mobile game lead the number of users to increase to more than 300 million in just two years. Pokémon was outsourcing to a NoSQL document database with fast read times, but they ran into issues managing more than 300 complex nodes and indices to achieve the speed they wanted. When certain nodes went down, users would lose access to the system and the operating team had to leave all other work to get the node back up and running. Pokémon was already using EC2, Elastic Load Balancer and S3 with success, and decided to migrate to AWS fully managed database services, using Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL. After the migration, the company was able to lessen the number of nodes from 300 to 30, monthly costs have dropped by tens of thousands of dollars, and after having 168 hours of downtime/performance degradation in the past 6 months, they have had zero hours since migrating. They have also modernized using DynamoDB TTL to track log in attempts and deny entry at the threshold, helping to limit the number of bot log in attempts and Elasticache service to reduce the time spent managing Memcached nodes for the company.^^6^^ \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\*Decisiv learns the true value of cloud migration, freeing their employees to focus on innovation.\\\\*\\\\*\\\\\\\\nDecisiv is a startup delivering cloud-based service relationship management \\\\(SRM\\\\) SaaS solutions for the commercial trucking industry to manage their fleets. Decisiv needed a highly available database to support their critical workload as any downtime is a loss of revenue and business to their customers. They also needed a scalable environment to allow their business to grow. The chief technology officer, Satish Joshi, also expressed wanting the development team to be able to create and deploy software at a more rapid pace. The company initially migrated to Amazon RDS for SQL Server, and later modernized by moving the workload to Aurora PostgreSQL. AWS multi availably zone deployment increased their uptime from 98 percent to over 99 percent for their critical workload. Decisiv also doubled their development productivity, benefitting from the agility of AWS to provision new environments in days, compared to weeks or months. When the company modernized from RDS for SQL server to Aurora PostgreSQL, they were able to combine multiple databases into a single Aurora instance. Decisiv was also able to improve their security on AWS to maintain compliance with industry regulations, such as NIST-800.^^7^^\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif; font-size:10px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\[1\\\\] \\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"font-size:10px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\[\\\\[https:~~/~~/aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/aris-global-rds-case-study/>>url:https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/aris-global-rds-case-study/\\\\]\\\\]\\\\(%%\\\\)\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif; font-size:10px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\[2\\\\]\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"font-size:10px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\) \\\\[\\\\[https:~~/~~/aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/amazon-database-migration/>>url:https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/amazon-database-migration/\\\\]\\\\]\\\\(%%\\\\)\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif; font-size:10px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\[3\\\\]\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"font-size:10px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\) \\\\[\\\\[https:~~/~~/aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/expedia-aurora-case-study/?did=cr\\\\_card&trk=cr\\\\_card>>url:https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/expedia-aurora-case-study/?did=cr\\\\_card&trk=cr\\\\_card\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif; font-size:10px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\[4\\\\]\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"font-size:10px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\) \\\\[\\\\[https:~~/~~/aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/cathay-pacific-rds-case-study/?did=cr\\\\_card&trk=cr\\\\_card>>url:https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/cathay-pacific-rds-case-study/?did=cr\\\\_card&trk=cr\\\\_card\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif; font-size:10px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\[5\\\\] \\\\[\\\\[https:~~/~~/aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/experian-achieves-uptime-with-dynamodb-aurora/?did=cr\\\\_card&trk=cr\\\\_card>>url:https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/experian-achieves-uptime-with-dynamodb-aurora/?did=cr\\\\_card&trk=cr\\\\_card\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\\[6\\\\]\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"font-size:10px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\) \\\\[\\\\[https:~~/~~/aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/the-pokemon-company-case-study/?did=cr\\\\_card&trk=cr\\\\_card>>url:https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/the-pokemon-company-case-study/?did=cr\\\\_card&trk=cr\\\\_card\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif; font-size:10px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\)\\\\[7\\\\]\\\\(% style=\\\\\\\\\\\"font-size:10px\\\\\\\\\\\" %\\\\) \\\\[\\\\[https:~~/~~/aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/decisiv/?did=cr\\\\_card&trk=cr\\\\_card>>url:https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/decisiv/?did=cr\\\\_card&trk=cr\\\\_card\\\\]\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\"}\\n[1]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/RelationalDatabaseMigrationPlaybook/CustomerSuccessStories/\\\\\\\"\\n[2]: https://phonetool.amazon.com/users/keenindi\\n[3]: /bin/view/AmazonWiki/Permissions/UserGuide/#HHowdoIchangethePrimaryContactvalueofaWikipage3F\\n[4]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/XWiki/keenindi\\\\\\\"\\n[5]: \\\\\\\"/bin/view/RelationalDatabaseMigrationPlaybook/CustomerSuccessStories/?viewer=code&showlinenumbers=1\\\\\\\"\"},{\"url\":\"https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AWS_Training_and_Certification_Product_Marketing_and_Messaging/References/NominateCSS/\",\"displayTitle\":\"Nominate Success Story\",\"domain\":\"wiki\",\"resultType\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"modificationDate\":1743698962000,\"score\":0,\"rank\":3,\"categoryList\":[],\"body\":\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n                    \\\\\\\\n      # Wiki source code of [Nominate Success Story][1]\\n\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\n              **Primary Owner **[ jannapel-team \\\\(LDAP\\\\) ][2]\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\n                                                                      \\\\\\\\n        Last modified 4 months ago by [ndebalch][3].\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n---\\n\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  [Show line numbers][4]\\\\\\\\n  {{html wiki=true}}\\\\\\\\n<img src=\\\\\\\\\\\"https:~//0s62bmu3aj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/PROD/pixel/tracker?PixelID=a2a21fb4-a4ea-0fe1-9ff9-91e8592b2cc6&login={{user/}}\\\\\\\\\\\">\\\\\\\\n{{/html}}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n{{transclude name=\\\\\\\\\\\"space:AWS\\\\_Training\\\\_and\\\\_Certification\\\\_Product\\\\_Marketing\\\\_and\\\\_Messaging.Nav\\\\_Bar\\\\\\\\\\\"/}}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA powerful success story extends beyond mere statistics of trained individuals or courses completed.

This substantial project is set to underscore ROX's proficiency as a trusted partner for intricate IT initiatives, predominantly those involving data and database migration.\\\\\\\\nDelicate Dance of Data Migration\\\\\\\\nCrucial for government bodies dealing with vast amounts of sensitive data, data migration entails the movement of information from legacy systems to new-age platforms. This complex process is underscored by the necessity to uphold data integrity, security, and compliance. ROX's expertise is being put to the test, as maintaining these critical elements during data transition is a challenging task that demands an in-depth understanding of both the old and the new systems.\\\\\\\\nEnhancing Performance with Database Migration\\\\\\\\nSimultaneously, database migration emerges as a vital component for boosting performance and accessibility. The primary objective is to address the prevalent issue of data silos in public sector organizations. By consolidating and migrating databases, ROX aims to dissolve these silos, thereby enhancing operational efficiency, fostering data-driven decision-making, and improving service delivery to citizens.\\\\\\\\nROX's Commitment to Digital Transformation\\\\\\\\nJim Rakesh, the Managing Director of ROX Hi Tech Limited, conveyed his enthusiasm about the contract, positing it as validation of ROX's aptitude in handling complex IT projects and their pledge to impactful digital transformation for their clientele. Rakesh stressed the significance of their work in the public sector and their dedication to effecting positive developments in both operational efficiency and citizen services.\\\\\\\\nComprehending the intricacies of database migration, particularly on platforms such as AWS, is integral to the successful execution of this project. Factors such as cost optimization, strategic measures, and efficiency all play a pivotal role. Utilizing features like AWS Schema Conversion Tool \\\\(SCT\\\\) and AWS DMS Schema Conversion, ROX Hi-Tech is poised to navigate this complex undertaking, paving the way for a more digitally evolved public sector.\\\\\\\\n\\\\* CCC \\\\(2025\\\\): Oracle -> Aurora PG\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\* Internal story. Insurance software industry.\\\\\\\\n\\\\*\\\\* CCC successfully migrated from a 175TB+ Oracle footprint to Aurora PostgreSQL on AWS. The end-state architecture features Aurora PostgreSQL with replication to a reporting Aurora PostgreSQL cluster. AWS Database Migration Service \\\\(DMS\\\\) provides the tooling for the replication pipeline. AWS teams sized 15+ Aurora PostgreSQL instances to match or exceed the performance of the original Oracle infrastructure. The migration approach employed Oracle to Aurora PostgreSQL using DMS. Specialist team ensured that the cutover strategy and reverse replication setup plans were sound. CCC adapted their strategy during cutover, opting for a full-load via DMS to mitigate risks associated with delta data change rates. This successful migration demonstrated AWS' capability to handle the most complex database transitions from Oracle to PostgreSQL. The launch empowers CCC to reduce vendor lock-in and achieving substantial cost savings through Oracle license elimination. This achievement reinforces AWS' position as a preferred destination for enterprises seeking to modernize their database infrastructure and optimize costs while eliminating expensive proprietary licensing agreements \\\\($4.5M annually\\\\).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n=== DMA Case Studies ===\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\* BMC Software: https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/bmc-software-case-study/\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Thomson Reuters: https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/thomson-reuters-video-case-study/\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Isetan: https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/isetan-mitsukoshi-case-study/ \\\\\\\\n\\\\* RWEST: https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/rwe-case-study/ \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n=== Table of references ===\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| |Customer|Type of migration|Region/Country|Industry|App classification|Case Study link|Source |Target|Aurora|Partner involved?\\\\\\\\n|3|Ventek international|heterogeneous| | |Data warehouse| |Oracle|MySQL|yes| \\\\\\\\n|16|Macromill|heterogeneous| | | | |Oracle|MySQL|yes|Insight Technology Inc\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n=== Technology Partners \\\\(ISVs\\\\) ===\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Pegasystems: Oracle -> PostgreSQL\\\\\\\\n\\\\* BMC Remedy: Oracle / SQL Server -> PostgreSQL \\\\(still in process, but willing to be a reference\\\\)\\\\\\\\n\\\\* LogicBay: Oracle -> PostgreSQL\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Blackboard Oracle -> RDS PostgreSQL\\\\\\\\n\\\\* Cheshire Datasystems \\\\(CDL - UK\\\\) Oracle -> RDS PostgreSQL.

Authentication is probably the *last* thing you want to think about when you're trying to ship features. But here's the thing - **CloudAuth isn't just another auth solution, it's your ticket to freedom.**\n\n### **The Problem You're Living With Right Now**\n\nYou're stuck between worlds, aren't you? Some services in Prod/Corp, others moving to AWS, and authentication is the chain keeping them apart. Your engineers waste hours managing keys, your security team loses sleep over vulnerabilities, and everyone's frustrated when simple service calls become engineering projects.\n\n### **Why CloudAuth Changes Everything**\n\n**35,000+ Amazon services** already trust CloudAuth to handle **1 billion data points every 5 minutes**. Why? Because it just works - everywhere, every time, without the drama.\n\n### **The Big 3 Reasons You Need This**\n\n🌐 **Works Everywhere** - Prod to AWS, AWS to AWS, Corp to Prod - CloudAuth doesn't care. Your services talk to each other seamlessly across ANY Amazon network.\n\n⚡ **Zero Heavy Lifting** - No daemons, no thick clients, no complex bootstrapping. Your Lambda functions and containers just authenticate. Period.\n\n🔒 **Security That Scales** - Built on OAuth2 with end-to-end TLS. InfoSec already loves it, so your security reviews become a breeze.\n\n### **Real Teams, Real Results**\n\nBill Kaper's Translation team was blocked from AWS adoption by auth complexity. With CloudAuth? They're now running hybrid Prod/AWS architectures with **50% lower database costs** and **40% better latency**.\n\n### **\"But we're not ready for a big migration...\"**\n\nPerfect! CloudAuth plays nice with your existing AAA setup. Migrate one service or a thousand - at your own pace. No big bang, no drama.\n\n### **Make the Move**\n\nYour competitors are already using CloudAuth to ship faster and more securely. Every day you wait is another day of:\n- Engineers fighting authentication instead of building features\n- Security gaps that keep you up at night  \n- AWS adoption blocked by legacy constraints\n\n**Ready to join the revolution?** Start at https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Dev.CDO/UnifiedAuth/CloudAuth/Onboarding/\n\nThe UnifiedAuth team provides Tier-1 support and office hours to ensure your success.\n\n**Bottom line:** CloudAuth isn't just authentication - it's your passport to modern, scalable, secure service architecture. Your future self will thank you for making the switch today.\n\n*Let's talk about your specific challenges and get you started. Because honestly?
