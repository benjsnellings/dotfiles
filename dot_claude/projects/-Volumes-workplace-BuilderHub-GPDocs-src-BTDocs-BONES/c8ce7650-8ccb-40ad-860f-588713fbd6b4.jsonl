When\n  deploying sidecars with your application, prefer using an image built and provided by the owner of\n  the daemon over building this daemon into a custom image yourself.\n\n* If you have multiple business logic applications that must scale independently, treat them as\n  independent applications and deploy them separately into their own infrastructure.\n\n* Avoid using ProcessManager. The intent of ProcessManager is subsumed by the containerization\n  process described above.\n\n* Fargate now supports 64-bit ARM architecture as a platform type in :awsdocs:`the task definition\n  <AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-arm64.html>`. Whether you choose to use x86-64 or adopt\n  ARM64 architecture, pick a single architecture to deploy within your pipeline. Compared to x86-64,\n  ARM64 provides better performance at a lower price, but ARM64 is `not available in all regions\n  <https://regions.aws.dev/services/features/statuses/fargate/fargate-graviton>`__.\n\n.. note:: Do not rely on container boundaries as a security layer.\n\n.. topic:: Why split dependencies into sidecars?\n   :class: expandable\n\n   Your application may be made up of your Java application with your business logic and several\n   daemons for observability, like the CloudWatch Agent and AWS X-Ray. Rather than bundle these\n   daemons with your application, run them as sidecars in your task.\n\n   This provides several benefits. It allows ECS to monitor the health of each container\n   independently and restart the task if one of its dependencies has failed.  It also reduces the\n   size of your application's version set, which reduces the latency of package caching during\n   builds. Additionally, it allows the sidecar application to update independently of the main\n   application, which can reduce the pain of high-severity software patching campaigns for software\n   present only in the sidecar image.\n\n   Containers are a lightweight separation of the responsibilities of executables within your\n   application, and they allow you to logically split your application's dependencies. Multiple\n   containers within the same task are co-located on the same hardware, scale together 1:1, and have\n   configurable resource allocation (CPU and RAM) on the target hardware. These properties make your\n   application's on-host dependencies well-suited for placement into a separate container within the\n   same task.\n\n   Make sure to mark sidecar containers as ``essential`` in your ECS TaskDefinition to ensure that\n   ECS only allows your application to run when its sidecar dependencies are functional.\n\n\n.. topic:: Why not couple separate business logic containers in one task?\n   :class: expandable\n\n   Containers in the same task are co-located on the same hardware, scale 1:1, and are analogous to\n   processes started on a single host. Containers in the same task can connect to each other via\n   ``localhost`` and share folders via ``bindmounts`` but do not provide a security boundary.\n   Coupling containers with independent business logic will increase the risk of availability and\n   security to your task overall.\n\n   If your containers don't need to be co-located, you should split them into Independent ECS tasks.\n   When separating your containers, consider formalizing The relationship with two separate\n   microservice applications with their own API; even if your service is the only consumer of the\n   API. Independent services With formalized API contracts strengthen the security and availability\n   of those Applications.\n\n\n.. topic:: Why not use ProcessManager?\n   :class: expandable\n\n   Although ProcessManager has been commonly used within Amazon on Apollo and native EC2 hosts to\n   orchestrate and monitor the processes that make up an application, this behavior is replaced in\n   containers by ECS managing the container lifecycle on your behalf.\n\n   A container image defines a single application, the ``entrypoint``, that is started when the\n   container starts. If you use ProcessManager, ProcessManager becomes the entrypoint. ECS allows\n   the container to continue to run so long as the entrypoint continues to run. Because\n   ProcessManager may still be active even if its child processes are failing, ECS is not aware of\n   problems within the container and will not shut down the container as expected.\n\n   Furthermore, the ``entrypoint`` becomes the special `init process\n   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init>`__ and has other responsibilities when starting and handling\n   child processes which ProcessManager was not designed to handle.\n\n   These hurdles are not insurmountable, but special care must be taken when deciding to subvert\n   standard containerization boundaries and run ProcessManager in Fargate.\n\n\n.. topic:: What if I must deploy to both x86-64 and ARM64?\n   :class: expandable\n\n   If you cannot wait and must adopt mixed architecture deployment immediately (for example,\n   to use ARM in regions that support it and fall back to x86-64 in those that don't), you\n   will need to work around several tooling limitations:\n\n   * Fargate task definitions currently only accept a single CPU architecture type, either\n     ``ARM64`` or ``X86_64``, and a single ECS service can only run one task definition. In\n     order to deploy multiple architectures, you must define two task definitions each with\n     a different value for ``CpuArchitecture``. In regions where you wish to run tasks with\n     both architectures, make sure to attach the tasks behind the same load balancer; this may\n     require refactoring your infrastructure to create the load balancer in a shared stack\n     (like the Cluster stack, in the case of the ECS-Fargate sample application) so that you\n     can deploy your ARM64 and x86-64 service stacks separately.\n\n\n* For more information on these topics, see:\n\n  * :doc:`containers:containers-best-practices`\n\n  * :doc:`nativedg:concept-application-associated-resources`\n\n  * :awsdocs:`ECS Application architecture documentation\n    <AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/application_architecture.html#application_architecture_fargate>`\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":65,"oldLines":7,"newStart":65,"newLines":14,"lines":["    Make sure to mark sidecar containers as ``essential`` in your ECS TaskDefinition to ensure that","    ECS only allows your application to run when its sidecar dependencies are functional."," ","+   .. caution::"," ","+      When an essential sidecar container fails or stops, all other containers of the same task will","+      be stopped.
